      "- 2018 I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\n",

      "- One of the few games worth full price in awhile IMO. If the game had another month or two in the oven I feel it would have been next to perfect at launch bug wise. Balancing of weapons needs some work currently, but that's an easy fix. Just please don't go the helldivers route and nerf everything that is decent.

The lack of chickens boiled my blood. CSGO made me angry, Until, I found my dream love, Deathmatch. A Chicken on any map, right then.. I'd kick the bots, and chase the chickens around for hours. Ah, It was so pleasurable, How I would do it for hours on end. The chickens are perfect. I play this game for hours on end, and the chickens never disapointment me now, Oh Chickens, how you are my one true love. I can't focus at school anymore.. I only think about chickens, on the way home from school there is a KFC, I walk past it every day, I think of chickens, One time, I literally stopped, and took a fap to one of the chickens. Ah, It was so good. ChickensI love themOh ChickensTHANK YOU GABEN5/5 I love chickens.\n",

      "- 2022 Product received for free CS:GO review from a free account Counter-strike: Global Offensive is a game in which two teams (One Terrorist, and the other Counter Terrorist) try to prevail against the other. The Terrorists try to plant the bomb at one of two sites or wipe out the other team, and the Counter terrorists try to stop the terrorists from accomplishing their tasks.Pros:Can be free to play (with limitations)- If you choose to play CS without upgrading your account, you can still play all of the game modes. It is actually pretty good for a free game. You cannot receive drops or a rank however. Steam cards are also not available to free accountsGood multiplayer game- CS can be played with teams of 5 friends if you queue up in competitive mode. Cs also has the largest player base of any game on steam, so there are always people to play with.Game is updated regularly- CS receives updates on the regular, and operations are added yearly (as of the date of this review)Number of hackers lessened- In my experience, the number of hackers in this game has been greatly reduced over the years. I am playing on a new free to play account (an alt) to test this, and it does seem to hold upCons:hacking is still prevalent in csgoThe ranking system is hard to understand- You may lose a game and de-rank, then go on to win 5 games with no rank up. You need to be patient with the ELO systemThere are not many gamemodes- To be fair, they have been updating cs and introduced things like short comp matchesOverall, csgo is a fun game, and if you dont care about getting a rank, a free to play account works well for your needs. I initially played casual for the first 2 years of my csgo gameplay (back in 2015). If you dont care about comp and ranks, this is essentially what a free account can offer you. You can get into games, and even play competitive mode these days without it being ranked. It is a fun game, and I do recommend it :)\n",
