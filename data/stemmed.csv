"2022 Hochland trait. Knowledgeable trait. 1000 other mechanics that used to be good but are now completely worthless. Did you know that this is a single player game and mildly overpowered mechanics that take a lot of work to take advantage of should be allowed?Also I understand there's a multiplayer community, and their gamemode should feel balanced. But stop bringing this overly balanced approached to single player, it's unfun.P.S. I don't care about conquest mode or any of the other multiplayer stuff that keeps getting added. I don't understand the obsession with trying to shoehorn coop into this game when it's not even done well.",hochland trait knowledg trait mechan use good complet worthless know singl player game mildli overpow mechan take lot work take advantag allowedalso understand there multiplay commun gamemod feel balanc stop bring overli balanc approach singl player unfunp dont care conquest mode multiplay stuff keep get ad dont understand obsess tri shoehorn coop game even done well
"2023 One step forward, two steps back.I'll start by addressing the elephant in the room. “You have 300 hours in the game, how can you not recommend it?”. Well, let me do a breakdown of how those hours were spent.150 hours - duplicating progress in my own world for sections that I already did with a friend.80 hours - riding around the open world and fighting copy-pasted enemies; exploring dungeons and fighting copy-pasted bosses and enemies.40 hours - the actual fun part of the game, legacy dungeons. These areas follow the format of the previous souls games and feature carefully-crafted, closed-off areas with interesting enemies and well-designed bosses.30 hours - arena PvP, invasions, co-op with randoms.So overall, that makes 70 hours of fun content, and 230 hours of filler. If you’re planning to buy this game to play with a friend, be prepared for a 7:23 ratio of fun to filler content. Now, I’d like to get into my criticisms with the game itself.Open World: The open world is honestly really beautiful and engaging in the first 3 areas, Limgrave, Liurnia, and Caelid. You won’t be able to explore it as intended on a horse while playing in multiplayer, but that’s not a big deal. These first areas have a good amount of content packed into them, and you’ll be seeing enemy varieties for the first time, so you won’t be bored of them yet. The problem begins 1/3 of the way into the game, at Altus Plateau. This area is really beautiful as well, and probably my favorite visually, but you will start to notice some really empty areas and a lot of copy-pasted enemies in the open world. After you get through Leyndell, you arrive at the worst part of the game - the Mountaintops of the Giants. This area has, I think, one single new enemy that is not just copy-pasted from the previous areas with a different skin. It’s not even worth the words to describe how bad this area is. If you buy the game despite my negative review, here’s some advice: hop on your horse and ride straight to the boss, because there’s nothing worth exploring here. Right after this is another empty snow area, but the devs use an innovative trick here - most of the area is covered in a snowstorm. This expertly hides the areas that they didn’t have time to finish, so you can’t see how devoid of content they are.Multiplayer:First of all, the netcode for this game’s multiplayer is absolute trash. Connecting to your friends fails or hangs about 10% of the time, and invading requires you to use the item 1-30 times before you’ll successfully invade someone. As far as anyone can tell, Fromsoft is basically still using the same netcode that they used back in Dark Souls in 2011, just with a couple of bandaids thrown on top to prevent infinite backstabs. Latency is a huge decider of every fight you will have, and a lot of the skill comes from being able to quickly identify the approximate ping difference between yourself and your opponent, and adapting your tactics accordingly.Your skills at PvE will not carry over at all. In PvE, you can look at an enemy’s attack and decide to press dodge if you think it will hit you, but in PvP, you have to press dodge anyways no matter where their weapon is because of the invisible hitboxes and latency. On top of this, Fromsoft decided to make the latency issues even more prominent by introducing powerful status effects that build up on you even if you successfully dodge an enemy attack. The top level of PvP is full of Scarlet Rot and Sleep status abusers who exploit the fact that these status effects build up on you even through dodges, and the “counter” for this is to duplicate items (cheating) which cure Rot/Sleep in the middle of combat. Oh, and if you want to turn their tactics around on them, then you’ll need to duplicate items too, because the sleep and rot grease are both limited in the quantity that you can obtain legitimately in a single playthrough. Watching a high-level invasion honestly makes me laugh with how many limited-use items both players are popping like candies. PvP is just laughably broken.On top of this, there are some multiplayer decisions made by the developers that cannot be described as anything other than stupid. First of all, co-op requires an item to even be allowed to summon people. In the early game, you’ll have to waste some time farming for flowers (and probably 10 minutes trying to figure out why you can’t summon, until you look it up). Next, if you kill a boss, you can’t summon your friend anymore or be invaded in that area. If you kill all the bosses in a particular open-world “chunk”, then that whole area is off-limits for multiplayer. When you kill a boss anywhere in the world, even if it’s just a random dragon in the open-world, you will be sent home as a cooperator. There are random fog-walls preventing you from entering caves with your friend, and you’ll have to disconnect, ride to that spot in your own world, enter the cave in your own world, then re-connect to your friend (logical, right? It obviously improves the gameplay).Finally, even when everything is working properly and the networking issues aren’t getting in the way, Elden Ring co-op is just horribly balanced. After the first couple of early-game bosses, every challenge in the game starts to become easy. Most enemies are simply not coded well to deal with multiple players attacking them. Bosses will change targets anytime they take damage, even if it’s a tiny throwing knife, meaning that aggro-juggling is incredibly easy. The bosses are supposed to be able to kill you by damaging you and then punishing you when you try to heal, but with aggro-juggling, you will always be able to heal unless you mess up horribly and get killed in a single combo. This does happen, so co-oping bosses can still take a few tries, but the difference between multiplayer and singleplayer is night-and-day. Despite the fact that the game increases enemies’ health in co-op, the game is at least 3 times easier. To try to compensate for that, my friend and I turned on the Taunter’s Tongue to attract invaders, but the game was still too easy, because it’s incredibly hard for an invader to fairly beat 2 people. If you try invading, you will probably walk into a blender of 3 people spamming spells and ashes of wars and die in 0.5 seconds. This means that the only people who are left invading at higher levels, the only people who can manage to have fun within this framework, are the players who are willing to use any tactic necessary to win. Be prepared to deal with lots of duplicated rot grease, duplicated Starlight Shards, snipes from across the map with duplicated Golem arrows, and nuke builds that can kill you if you make a single mistake. I don’t even blame the players who are using these tactics, because without them, there would be no invaders at higher levels. The game is simply so broken that players are forced to resort to these tactics to have a >0.5% chance of winning invasions.Story:The story is mostly incomprehensible if you rely solely on playing the game. You have to watch Youtube videos to have any idea of what’s going on. After watching some, though, I came to this conclusion:Every one of the main players is a greedy ♥♥♥♥. George R. R. Martin tried to craft a complicated story, but the gameplay just doesn’t support it. Imagine Game of Thrones, but there are no background civilians in the story. It’s just the lords and ladies fighting over empty castles full of monsters. That’s Elden Ring. Every single creature attacks you on sight, and there are no visible civilians. You are fighting to become the Lord of ashes.Overall, the game is alright, but it’s simply not a good way to spend your time. It all comes back to the 7:23 ratio of fun to filler. Maybe others will find that to be an acceptable ratio, but I don’t. I wish I could get back the hours that I spent on this game, and I implore others not to make the same mistake that I did.",one step forward two step backil start address eleph room hour game recommend well let breakdown hour hour duplic progress world section alreadi hour ride around open world fight copypast enemi explor dungeon fight copypast boss hour actual fun part game legaci dungeon area follow format previou soul game featur carefullycraft closedoff area interest enemi welldesign hour arena pvp invas coop randomsso overal make hour fun content hour filler your plan buy game play friend prepar ratio fun filler content id like get critic game itselfopen world open world honestli realli beauti engag first area limgrav liurnia caelid wont abl explor intend hors play multiplay that big deal first area good amount content pack youll see enemi varieti first time wont bore yet problem begin way game altu plateau area realli beauti well probabl favorit visual start notic realli empti area lot copypast enemi open world get leyndel arriv worst part game mountaintop giant area think one singl new enemi copypast previou area differ skin even worth word describ bad area buy game despit neg review here advic hop hors ride straight boss there noth worth explor right anoth empti snow area dev use innov trick area cover snowstorm expertli hide area didnt time finish cant see devoid content aremultiplayerfirst netcod game multiplay absolut trash connect friend fail hang time invad requir use item time youll success invad someon far anyon tell fromsoft basic still use netcod use back dark soul coupl bandaid thrown top prevent infinit backstab latenc huge decid everi fight lot skill come abl quickli identifi approxim ping differ oppon adapt tactic accordinglyyour skill pve carri pve look enemi attack decid press dodg think hit pvp press dodg anyway matter weapon invis hitbox latenc top fromsoft decid make latenc issu even promin introduc power statu effect build even success dodg enemi attack top level pvp full scarlet rot sleep statu abus exploit fact statu effect build even dodg counter duplic item cheat cure rotsleep middl combat oh want turn tactic around youll need duplic item sleep rot greas limit quantiti obtain legitim singl playthrough watch highlevel invas honestli make laugh mani limitedus item player pop like candi pvp laughabl brokenon top multiplay decis made develop describ anyth stupid first coop requir item even allow summon peopl earli game youll wast time farm flower probabl minut tri figur cant summon look next kill boss cant summon friend anymor invad area kill boss particular openworld chunk whole area offlimit multiplay kill boss anywher world even random dragon openworld sent home cooper random fogwal prevent enter cave friend youll disconnect ride spot world enter cave world reconnect friend logic right obvious improv gameplayfin even everyth work properli network issu arent get way elden ring coop horribl balanc first coupl earlygam boss everi challeng game start becom easi enemi simpli code well deal multipl player attack boss chang target anytim take damag even tini throw knife mean aggrojuggl incred easi boss suppos abl kill damag punish tri heal aggrojuggl alway abl heal unless mess horribl get kill singl combo happen coop boss still take tri differ multiplay singleplay nightandday despit fact game increas enemi health coop game least time easier tri compens friend turn taunter tongu attract invad game still easi incred hard invad fairli beat peopl tri invad probabl walk blender peopl spam spell ash war die second mean peopl left invad higher level peopl manag fun within framework player will use tactic necessari win prepar deal lot duplic rot greas duplic starlight shard snipe across map duplic golem arrow nuke build kill make singl mistak dont even blame player use tactic without would invad higher level game simpli broken player forc resort tactic chanc win invasionsstoryth stori mostli incomprehens reli sole play game watch youtub video idea what go watch though came conclusioneveri one main player greedi georg r r martin tri craft complic stori gameplay doesnt support imagin game throne background civilian stori lord ladi fight empti castl full monster that elden ring everi singl creatur attack sight visibl civilian fight becom lord ashesoveral game alright simpli good way spend time come back ratio fun filler mayb other find accept ratio dont wish could get back hour spent game implor other make mistak

"2018 I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",yo father probabl one oldest peopl play game singl farther son son got game christma uncl instal comput start play end week hour game horribl alreadi hard find way spend time son alway friend watch youtub decid make steam account get game see could mayb play alongsid load game pick charact world start play stuck suppos ask son help host game join love best time spent son sinc wife die game ever sinc brought son closer actual spend time togeth outsid hous togeth well game remind there fun everyth brought son mani happi memori
"''BURN THE HERETIC, KILL THE MUTANT, PURGE THE UNCLEAN'' - Angels of Death.Joking aside, this game is everything the Warhammer 40k: Space Marine community wanted and expected. Not only is it a well-made continuation of the previous title, but it also serves as a warning to the gaming industry that people want simpler, shorter games with a lot of quality and refinement, which I will present here:Intense Combat: The combination of gunfights with hand-to-hand combat keeps the action immersive and varied.Visuals and Environment Design: Graphical improvements and attention to detail ensure an impressive visual experience.Immersive Storyline: Your exploration of the dystopian universe of Warhammer 40k becomes so immersive with a mature narrative focused on epic battles.Enemy Hordes: The presence of the Tyranids brings an additional element of challenge, forcing the player to always be on the move and plan each attack. Not only that, the traitorous heretics are also very difficult opponents to deal with, especially on higher difficulties, making you have to rethink your strategy.Art direction: Many forget to mention this, but the art direction of this game is incredible, from the large battlefield scenarios to the gigantic cathedrals, the details on the walls of the buildings. Everything in this game seems to be a painting, and sometimes the combat in this game doesn't let you realize this, but when you get a moment of peace to look around you, it's almost impossible not to be impressed.However, there are some points to consider:Possible Repetitiveness: Depending on the game's progression, combat against large hordes can become repetitive.The campaign: It is of average length, depending on the difficulty you're playing on, but it maintains a good narrative. -Anyway, I believe that WARHAMMER 40K: SPACE MARINES 2 is currently a warning beacon for the industry that it is not necessary to make major ""innovations"" to make a good game, giving an example that with just a little refinement in something that was already good it is enough to make a good game. Anyway, this is my analysis/opinion about this game, I hope that with this I have helped you in some way to decide whether to play the game or not :)",burn heret kill mutant purg unclean angel deathjok asid game everyth warhamm space marin commun want expect wellmad continu previou titl also serv warn game industri peopl want simpler shorter game lot qualiti refin present hereintens combat combin gunfight handtohand combat keep action immers variedvisu environ design graphic improv attent detail ensur impress visual experienceimmers storylin explor dystopian univers warhamm becom immers matur narr focus epic battlesenemi hord presenc tyranid bring addit element challeng forc player alway move plan attack traitor heret also difficult oppon deal especi higher difficulti make rethink strategyart direct mani forget mention art direct game incred larg battlefield scenario gigant cathedr detail wall build everyth game seem paint sometim combat game doesnt let realiz get moment peac look around almost imposs impressedhowev point considerposs repetit depend game progress combat larg hord becom repetitiveth campaign averag length depend difficulti your play maintain good narr anyway believ warhamm space marin current warn beacon industri necessari make major innov make good game give exampl littl refin someth alreadi good enough make good game anyway analysisopinion game hope help way decid whether play game

"2022 Personally I can't recommend the game in its current state right now, this review comes a fair time after launch and after some patches to fix certain issues/balancing with the game. I pre ordered the game and played on release; the amount of hours I have in the game (48.4 at the time of writing) speaks to how much fun i had with the title. While I know it's been changed now, the main campaign is utterly atrocious with its invasive mechanics and mind numbing realms of chaos mechanics (♥♥♥♥ YOU TZEENTCH RANDOM TELEPORTS), I don't know who thought this was a fun or good idea on the Dev side but it really neutered my enjoymnet of the game after my first play through.The game can legitimately be enjoyable, I won't pretend I've played every faction to a T or explored every nook and cranny of their tech/lord trees as we all have our own personal tastes; what I did play was fun for a bit, but it wore off very quickly. I think they did a superb job with numerous quality of life changes, but overall the game feels like a lesser package than WH2. You could indeed make the argument that WH2 has had years of DLC to accompany it and I'd agree, but if you compare WH1 to WH2 the quality difference compared to game 2-3 is staggering. I waited to make this review to give them time to iron out bugs/do balancing, but mostly wait for immortal Empires which is the big pull for the game, today we learned the BETA for it isn't coming out for another 3-6 months which at least to me is mind boggling. WH2 had ME out if i recall within a month or two, on one hand they're trying to make sure everything works smoothly before releasing it, on the other so many issues in game were so blatant I don't know how they weren't found in QA/playtesting/Beta, by the time content creators got their hands on it it wasn't realistic to expect such ingrained issues to be fixed by then. Lord defeat traits being a joke, some skill trees being a lackluster joke in comparison to others, tech trees also on the seesaw between being fun and engaging/a boring almost not noticeable change, hero traits also being neutered from WH2; it's sad.Overall I think it's an ok game, I'm just very disappointed and I feel bad for getting my friend excited to play it with me only for us to get bored in our co-op campaign within a week.

But its fun and thats what matters.Where I feel the game falls short is, that there is no Dedicated Server, I really don't see why... so you are stuck at having most of your friends on one server, and if its full, then FU because you wont be able to join them and will be forced to play on another server by yourself, unless they move in with you and start all over again from scratch.

"2022 I've been a long-time total war player and a fan of both historical and fantasy titles. It breaks my heart to criticize it so, but I cannot recommend this game at this time. It has great potential, and its features and factions are great. However, it is poorly, poorly optimized. At ultra graphics, textures and details in this game still look worse than the beautiful units you'll find in Warhammer 2. The requirements are higher than Warhammer 2, and the base game requires an incredible 120 GB, twice that Warhammer 2 needed WITH its DLCs. Will Warhammer 3 require 200 GB when DLCs are released--or are some of those files pre-installed, forcing players to store files that they have not chosen to purchase yet? Either is unacceptable. We require higher tier GPUs, double the storage space, and 60 dollars to get a product that currently has less content AND worse performance than a game released years ago? Those are just some of the main issues as bugs of all sorts abound:-For some/many players, multiplayer lobbies do not appear properly, instead showing no MP lobbies or showing them cycling in and out in ones or pairs. -There is no in-game chat, which for some unfathomable reason the game was published without. In other words, if you want to play team MP with people who are not your friends, expect zero communication--not to mention people will struggle to even see your lobby, let alone join and play.I really hope the issues are fixed. Some of them are just obvious and the willingness to publish with the game in this stage demonstrates a profound disrespect for players, fans, and total war's own brand. Look no further than Total War: Three Kingdoms to see cause for concern. That was a game they charged everyone 60 dollars with a completely unplayable multiplayer , and they never bothered to fix it, instead discontinuing support for it within a couple of years. The issues were obvious, and surely reparable.

"2022 As it stands right now I cannot endorse this game nor recommend anyone to spend their money on it.The reason being that (as many other reviews have pointed out) on release the game had come out with significantly worse performance than I was expecting. With my current set-up I am capable of running the previous game, ultra settings, 1440p and easily maintain 60fps under most conditions with an average GPU temp of 64c.This game however, running at the same settings I was struggling to maintain even 30 fps and had an average GPU temp of 85c with spikes over 90c, in fact I had begun to smell molten plastic. I wasn't able to reach 60fps until I had toned down all the settings to the absolute lowest and went to 1080p, however doing this still resulted in average temps approaching 80c.The weird thing is that performance seems to vary wildly between users and there are people with worse systems (I use a 1080ti and an I7 7700k) having better performance and people with better systems having worse performance and vice versa with no clear pattern. So, granted, you may very well have a smooth ride, though likely isn't worth the gamble considering there's been reports from some users that this game had outright fried their system.In addition it would appear that there are early access folks reporting the game ran better even just the day before release. Then after a patch hit and the game released they had worse performance. When comparing benchmarks they had found that some of them would have of up to 50% reduced performance. It could be the poor implementation of a last-minute denuvo inclusion, it could be that the patch accidentally messed up some other factors, it is not known at this point. Regardless, the game doesn't function as it ought to and until it is fixed, I recommend to anyone reading this to spare your PC this unoptimised mess and wait.",stand right endors game recommend anyon spend money itth reason mani review point releas game come significantli wors perform expect current setup capabl run previou game ultra set easili maintain condit averag gpu temp game howev run set struggl maintain even fp averag gpu temp spike fact begun smell molten plastic wasnt abl reach tone set absolut lowest went howev still result averag temp approach weird thing perform seem vari wildli user peopl wors system use better perform peopl better system wors perform vice versa clear pattern grant may well smooth ride though like isnt worth gambl consid there report user game outright fri systemin addit would appear earli access folk report game ran better even day releas patch hit game releas wors perform compar benchmark found would reduc perform could poor implement lastminut denuvo inclus could patch accident mess factor known point regardless game doesnt function ought fix recommend anyon read spare pc unoptimis mess wait
"2022 Hands down one of the best games I've ever played! I'm kind of new to the Soulsborne type of games, some of my gaming friends used to be die hard Dark Souls players, however for some reason I never got into it. But Elden Ring sucked me in and I managed to spend a ton of fun hours in it. In times like this when greedy publishers like EA are all about lootboxes and pleasing their shareholders, these FromSoftware boys come out with this gem and show us what it feels like to play a proper game again, thanks guys! I'm actually gonna start playing Dark Souls after this.Awesome game, highly replayable, beautiful world and no gated content.

"As I face the reality of my terminal illness diagnosis, This game has become a rare light in my life. Growing up I found comfort in the unforgiving challenge and beauty of soulslike games, and now, in what may be my final months, this game has given me a chance to reconnect with that comfort one last time.The developers have created a visually stunning and mechanically precise action RPG that offers both the challenge and the sense of achievement that we crave. The intricate combat, alongside the visually striking environments, makes every moment memorable. It’s given me something to look forward to, allowing me to lose myself in its rich world when I need it most.If you're a fan of soulslike games and appreciate the art of a well crafted challenge, I can't recommend Black Myth: Wukong enough. To me, it's not just a game: it's a gift, providing a final sense of purpose and achievement. My deepest gratitude goes to the developers for creating this masterclass.",face realiti termin ill diagnosi game becom rare light life grow found comfort unforgiv challeng beauti soulslik game may final month game given chanc reconnect comfort one last timeth develop creat visual stun mechan precis action rpg offer challeng sens achiev crave intric combat alongsid visual strike environ make everi moment memor given someth look forward allow lose rich world need mostif your fan soulslik game appreci art well craft challeng cant recommend black myth wukong enough game gift provid final sens purpos achiev deepest gratitud goe develop creat masterclass
"Once Human | By Wholf Once Human is a game I've dedicated around 200 hours to, playing every single day and experiencing a range of emotions from fun and laughter to excitement. In my opinion, this game is definitely a contender for Game of the Year, though it does need some fixes. The game offers an open-world survival experience filled with monsters, elite bosses, dungeons, silos, Easter eggs, puzzles, and many other features. There are bizarre creatures, a compelling storyline (which could use some updates), stunning graphics, smooth gameplay, and a robust base-building system (though it could use more features and clipping fixes). Unfortunately, the servers/worlds in Once Human feel empty and inactive. Despite there being hundreds of bases, only a few are in use. With a maximum of 400 players per world, I rarely encounter other players, except during world events. This issue needs addressing soon as finding an active Warband or Hive is currently challenging. For example, I've been looking for an active Warband on my server, but no one seems to engage in world chat or participate in Warband activities, which is disappointing. Luckily, a fix is coming in August, so let's hope for the best. The same issue applies to playing with friends. Some of my friends can't join my server because it's full, even though it feels empty. This problem is also expected to be resolved in August. However, another issue arises with new players joining level 50 players. While we could share items and boost them, it's not ideal. I can't wait to play with my whole group, but I don't want to start over again. Some players complain about two files and claim the game is Pay2Win. First, the two files are harmless, and all information about them is available online. Second, the game is not Pay2Win; you can only buy cosmetics and the battle pass. Once you reach level 50, obtain the best gear and weapons, complete all villages, cities, areas, side quests, and main quests, and build a powerful character, the game feels complete. Personally, I've finished everything significant, maybe missing a few puzzles. Now, I'm making YouTube tutorials, exploring, finding Easter eggs, and reworking my base. I have high hopes for more content in the future and can't wait to see what's next. The game offers a lot: a vast world with plenty of activities, challenges, world events, areas to clear, puzzles, Easter eggs, a compelling storyline, base-building, unique items, and extensive weapon and gear customization. The music and sound effects are also exceptionally well done, especially the main menu music, which reminds me of the good old Call of Duty days. However, the game might be too easy. A level 20 player can fight level 30/40 enemies with the right loadouts. Leveling up is also straightforward if you focus on exploring and doing quests rather than just dungeons. It depends on your playstyle really. The development team is very active and communicative, providing information, answering questions, handling tickets, and more. They are passionate, and I'm happy to work with them. Unlike many companies with big games, this team handles things well, and I wish them all the best. Additionally, if you're on a PvP server and in a PvP zone, sometimes objects and buildings don't render properly over long distances. This can create the illusion that you can hit an enemy when they are actually hidden behind a rock or inside a house. I've encountered this multiple times, and it's quite frustrating. Hopefully, this issue will be fixed soon. Another point to consider in PvP is that if you're getting wrecked by an opponent, it might be because they're using a powerful build, like the Shrapnel build, which deals a lot of damage. Keep that in mind!To summarize, here are the top 5 positives and negatives:Positives:1. The vast array of features Once Human offers.2. The base-building and crafting system.3. The detailed loadout system with blueprints and modifications.4. A large world with plenty to explore, discover, and solve.5. The game's impressive graphics and immersive environment.Negatives:1. The server system, where friends can't join and servers feel empty.2. The game being a bit too easy.3. Overpowered builds if done correctly.4. A clunky building system with alignment and clipping issues.5. Occasional crashes, even on a perfectly capable PC.Overall, Once Human is a highly enjoyable game. It's free-to-play, packed with features, boasts great graphics, and is easy to progress in. Despite minor bugs, well-developed systems, and the need for updates, Once Human feels like a blend of Palworld, Fallout 76, and Rust. I'm giving it a 9.2/10 so far. Great job, and I can't wait to see its future.Here is my YouTube Once Human playlist: YouTube™ Video: Once Human - ALL REDEEMABLE CODES Views: 22,134 Here is the copy/paste list of redeemable codes in Once Human currently. =================== ONCEHUMAN0710 CDYM4MXDNH OH000007 HYD7MY66RT FCNX8NHXJ7 The additional codes listed below are from...

"2023 greedy and stupid, stupid and greedy. Been a total war fan since shogun total war one, but i'm just passed my breaking point with CA and segas ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Every new game they manage to down grade core things and remove features. Even TW troy, the units just flail at eachother. Early and mid 2000s total war games function better and offer a more immersive experience than games coming out 15 years later. Then the audacity of their DLC price model is the equivalent of having someone spit in your face. The first Chaos lord pack was such a joke, just blatantly transparent that they removed them from the core game and resold them. Then the chaos dwarves were half the price of the game and feel like such a poorly thought out, not play tested pile of half cooked ideas. It should have been such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lay up, but they give you a watered down economy that makes all of your provinces have to be identical just to sustain themselves, let alone giving you resources for Second and third armies. I literally Cant bring myself to recommend total war games to my friends because its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ embarrassing how greedy CA has gotten. The cherry on top is them basically saying ""buy it or we'll just kill off the game."" These guys deserve every ounce of hate they're getting.

"2023 I can not in good faith recommend this game in its current state and the developers recent statement of threatening to outright cutting support from this game if we don't buy the overpriced DLC for almost HALF the price of the base game? It's ridiculous. I have over 1K hours between the three games combined and I can not stand by this. The company has let bugs fester for months on end that hinder or prevent users from using PAID content they paid for in game 2 (Nakai recruiting Kroxigors or Ariel spawning as examples) despite the community fixing them day 1, some of the slowest patch cycles for any game dev in this era, and now threatening their customers who are standing up for an unreasonable price increase? For less content than what we were buying just a few years ago with the Tomb Kings, Vampire Coast, or even the lord packs of game 2. This company is beyond greedy with no respect to their players who have stood with them for a decade now. Do not buy this game unless you're ok with having to rely on modders create a better experience than the devs can ever achieved and having to pay for overpriced dlc that cost nearly half as much as some triple A games on the market.",good faith recommend game current state develop recent statement threaten outright cut support game dont buy overpr dlc almost half price base game ridicul hour three game combin stand compani let bug fester month end hinder prevent user use paid content paid game nakai recruit kroxigor ariel spawn exampl despit commun fix day slowest patch cycl game dev era threaten custom stand unreason price increas less content buy year ago tomb king vampir coast even lord pack game compani beyond greedi respect player stood decad buy game unless your ok reli modder creat better experi dev ever achiev pay overpr dlc cost nearli half much tripl game market

"2020 Valve doesn't care about cheaters. They can go 900+ hours without getting banned, maybe even longer, even when the vod clearly shows wallhacks/aimbot. It gets worse and worse the closer to global you get, at supreme. It's not every game, but when it does happen (once a day? Maybe every two days?) It's incredibly frustrating. You believe they're just outplaying you at every turn, but then you watch the vod and see some ♥♥♥♥ that even shroud/kennyS couldnt do. This occurs even at high rank prime matchmaking. You even start to see repeat accounts that get banned over and over, same name same pic, for months. These accounts can rack up 500+ Hours of just cheating and getting to high rank. Valve makes more money off the cheaters than people who buy keys, so they have a super lax anti-cheat. You don't see anywhere near this level of cheating on fortnite, a vastly less competitive game, so it's definitely possible to stop these cheats.",valv doesnt care cheater go hour without get ban mayb even longer even vod clearli show wallhacksaimbot get wors wors closer global get suprem everi game happen day mayb everi two day incred frustrat believ theyr outplay everi turn watch vod see even shroudkenni couldnt occur even high rank prime matchmak even start see repeat account get ban name pic month account rack hour cheat get high rank valv make money cheater peopl buy key super lax anticheat dont see anywher near level cheat fortnit vastli less competit game definit possibl stop cheat

"2022 Idk what they did but the performance and visuals compared to warhammer 2 are seriously lacking. Visual glitches on campaign map specifically is crazy. Textures voble up and down and so does the armies. Using more overall fog to hide it isn't helping but that seems to be what the devs tried to do. I really like this game mechanic and gameplay wise but the performance is just a big downside. On another note I am not fond of supply lines especially now that you need more smaller armies spread out in your lands to battle incurions from the randomly spawned demon gates. The prologue was super cool tho and I love the improvements to co-op like playing on the same turn, building outposts and recruiting your friends troops and spectater/teams when battling etc. Overall I would say the game is good but it needs more polishing.(P.S I sure wish they would've gone with another design on Miao Yings hair in dragon form)UPDATE: They have improved a lot, still a few glitches here and there I won't deny it. However, Apart from the exclusive campaign for warhammer 3 the Mortal Empires Campaign is a masterpiece! Ithas a ton of great features and content.

"I am so sad that our beloved game csgo died for cs2. This game is so bad!- anti cheat is terrible, people are getting false bans for high sensitivity/amd drivers & while real cheaters are not getting banned (VAC = VALVE ALLOW CHEATS)- no new content for months (Even old content has been removed upon this)- no new operation which is crazy since there has been leaks about seasonal operations- no new case even though there has been many leaks of new skins and new submissions in the workshop- all of the achievements are gone that we had in csgo and now we are left with one useless achievement xD- danger zone which got released when csgo whent free to play is gone...- the original deathmatch mode where it was team vs team is gone- the sub tick is embarrassing how bad it is, all we have been asking for is 128tick and this is what we got?- you can't switch left/right hand anymore- there is no commands for changing weapon bobbing anymore- no arms race (best gamemode in my opinion)- no flying scoutsman really fun gamemode that they should have released the game, it's really fun for us casual players- watching demos are really bad- no overwatch system and that leaves us with the bad reporting system where everybody who gets X amount of griefing reports gets banned- performance issues, even pros who bought PC's with the best components have issues with performance so imagine how it would be for someone who doesn't have all this money- peekers advantage is just crazy in this gameThe thing that is crazy about all of this is that Valve made almost 1 billion dollar in cases last year...

"2022 Is this the best souls like game ever? Maybe not, probably yes, but I can whole wholeheartedly say that this is an amazing game. It will probably be my 2022 GOTY.Yes, it has some problems here and there, especially the online connectivity, but I have enjoyed every minute while playing it.The open world gives me plenty of space to explore and find interesting things, the story is the most fleshed out of the latest From Software games, except Sekiro, that one has the story told in more conventional ways, but the combat makes up for that. Here are so many characters in this game and each on of them has so much dialogue. It is a lot easier to make out the story in Elden Ring than any Dark Souls, Bloodborn or Demon Souls. And oh my God, the worldbuilding is so vast.The gameplay is the well known souls-like gameplay, but this time the player has so many more tools to use to overcome hardships in the world of Lands Between. From better spells with longer range to ashes of war that can be put on almost any weapon and summoning ashes to help you during boss fights or while exploring the world. I think even the co-op experience is a lot easier than in the past games. Now you have basically infinite resources to call other players to help and you can no longer be invaded if you play alone. Invasions also have no great rewards so I think most people won't even invade. Yes, some people hate that invasions are mandatory for co-op and I respect their opinion, but I don't agree with it.The game offers a vast array of bosses and weapons, which can be further customized with different ashes of war. This makes the game feel very diverse. I've played 3 different characters from start (with two of them I've completed the game close to 100%, 3rd playthrough is still not finished) and I have to say that it felt very different every time.Elden Ring is one of those games which I will never delete from my hard drive and will always come back to it and play some more.",best soul like game ever mayb probabl ye whole wholeheartedli say amaz game probabl gotyy problem especi onlin connect enjoy everi minut play itth open world give plenti space explor find interest thing stori flesh latest softwar game except sekiro one stori told convent way combat make mani charact game much dialogu lot easier make stori elden ring dark soul bloodborn demon soul oh god worldbuild vastth gameplay well known soulslik gameplay time player mani tool use overcom hardship world land better spell longer rang ash war put almost weapon summon ash help boss fight explor world think even coop experi lot easier past game basic infinit resourc call player help longer invad play alon invas also great reward think peopl wont even invad ye peopl hate invas mandatori coop respect opinion dont agre itth game offer vast array boss weapon custom differ ash war make game feel divers ive play differ charact start two ive complet game close playthrough still finish say felt differ everi timeelden ring one game never delet hard drive alway come back play

"As an official creator for the game I can't quite grasp what and where they went wrong with the release. While it's known to not play an MMO on release day or on patch day I felt like there have been many things changed and not to the better. Within the 1.4 hours I've already encountered many things which shouldn't be there or are back in the game. As much as I love the concept but let me break down the things that made me slightly sour:- I either have a spontaneous lost of eyesight or there has been a graphic downgrade. On highest settings everything looks like well a blurry mobile game. This wasn't the case in the betas nor the demo- You can't choose your haircolor properly anymore and I have the feel you later on have to pay for different variants for it- The design of Mitsuko looks more ""fckable"" but also well why? Do we need to do that to catch the horny bois? (personal preference tho so you can ignore that point)- EULA I also made the mistake of not reading in the past the EULA cause I wouldn't think of a STEAM game collecting the data of: my credit card info, my bank info, my profile and password, my exact address, the information about what I consume and click on in the webs, my social media and more. THIS IS A ♥♥♥♥ DANGER- animations apparently don't work as intended and got changed partially to way less animated options like basically everything with your pickaxe or how enemies die- the one character per server and account which is not deletable is a known bug that they want to change but still horrible for launch day- Wrong and partially still not existing translation of objects which should've been fixed by now (or so I hoped)- many enemies looking like plastic figures cause of the graphics (V included)- endlessly loading chat and not sending messages- fell through the map a couple of times- enemies bugged in the groundAll in all I said it in the past and I will say it again. The game should've put more time into development than into it's advertisement. While I also find reviewspamming ♥♥♥♥ I can see where people are coming from and I know that this release will hurt the game enough that the playercount won't recover.I will change my recommendation as soon as things change to the better. But I am not a creator that is sugarcoating things that should've been evened out long ago by all it's betas and demo.So my recommendation is: wait a bit for a couple of patches. I will do too.

"2022 I will be revisiting this review later, but 10 hours in and I'm having a great time. This is one of those few games that I can recommend at full price.EDIT: I have beaten the game, and have played for 75 hours. Time for a more comprehensive review.This game is a fantastic entry point into Souls for people who bounced off the series before, while still managing to be a top tier entry into the genre for those who were already on board (such as myself). The open world is expertly done, taking many lessons from Breath of the Wild and improving upon it with a better reward structure for exploration, tense encounters with many different types of adversaries, and a wide possibility of builds for your character to progress through the game with.The sense of discovery found in this game is near unmatched. Every major area feels unique in both visual aesthetic and gameplay requirements. Quite a lot of time and love went into making it a joy for players to stumble into areas that were much grander than initially perceived, and those moments just seem to keep coming. Like all Souls games, Elder Ring has its share of secrets areas and bosses that many people will never see, even after hitting the credits. While I encourage you to explore actively, I would also advise you to not look up those secrets until after you complete the game, and let your first adventure in the world be truly your own. Trust me, you will have plenty of resources without having to resort to any walkthrough.",revisit review later hour im great time one game recommend full priceedit beaten game play hour time comprehens reviewthi game fantast entri point soul peopl bounc seri still manag top tier entri genr alreadi board open world expertli done take mani lesson breath wild improv upon better reward structur explor tens encount mani differ type adversari wide possibl build charact progress game withth sens discoveri found game near unmatch everi major area feel uniqu visual aesthet gameplay requir quit lot time love went make joy player stumbl area much grander initi perceiv moment seem keep come like soul game elder ring share secret area boss mani peopl never see even hit credit encourag explor activ would also advis look secret complet game let first adventur world truli trust plenti resourc without resort walkthrough

"Product received for free Early negative review: seems like if Gear of War if it didn't have a shred of humanity, and looked really good. It's middling in a lot of ways, and the one way it is exceptional is that it is like Zoolander: really really really ridiculously good looking. Graphically demanding, and while it runs fairly well, it has an upscaling menu that bears some dire implications for the future of graphics (AI upscaling presented as balanced option, native resolution presented as ultra-premium quality option). Overheats your PC for fairly basic gameplay. Guns are good, slightly underwhelming, melee is a very lightweight system with a dash of Arkham and not particularly deep. Could be that it gets better, but I'm not in any hurry to find out. Once again, it feels like Gears of War but with the armor system replacing the cover system. Not in love with the tone, it's very self-serious and dire and slow, and you run into a lot of characters that are just so flat and one dimensional. Not much popcorn appeal there, but it's also hard to take with any gravitas since the game is just about big silly action figures ripping apart lizards. It also lacks the mortality and urgency of Gears characters, since space marines are basically invincible superheroes in their universe walking past expendable nameless IG that they'd be willing to sacrifice without a second's hesitation. Grim, serious (verging on joyless) invincibility fantasy is just an odd wavelength to try and play along with in a basic TPS.

"This game is nothing short of a breathtaking experience. From the moment you step into its richly detailed world, you can feel the care and craftsmanship that went into every aspect of the game. The visuals are stunning, with environments that are not only beautiful but also incredibly immersive. Each location is meticulously designed, drawing inspiration from Chinese mythology in a way that feels both authentic and fantastical.The combat system is a standout feature, offering a perfect blend of challenge and satisfaction. Every encounter feels meaningful, requiring skill and strategy rather than button-mashing. The variety of enemies keeps the gameplay fresh, and the boss battles are nothing short of epic, each one a unique test of your abilities.But what truly elevates ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is its storytelling. The narrative is deep and engaging, weaving together familiar tales from ""Journey to the West"" with fresh twists that keep you hooked from start to finish. The protagonist, Sun Wukong, is brought to life with a complexity and depth that makes his journey all the more compelling.Had a blast so far, highly recommended.",game noth short breathtak experi moment step richli detail world feel care craftsmanship went everi aspect game visual stun environ beauti also incred immers locat meticul design draw inspir chines mytholog way feel authent fantasticalth combat system standout featur offer perfect blend challeng satisfact everi encount feel meaning requir skill strategi rather buttonmash varieti enemi keep gameplay fresh boss battl noth short epic one uniqu test abilitiesbut truli elev black myth wukong storytel narr deep engag weav togeth familiar tale journey west fresh twist keep hook start finish protagonist sun wukong brought life complex depth make journey compellinghad blast far highli recommend

"2022 Dark Souls IIII with jump button and open world Elden Ring is an evolution of established design trends of From Software studio. ER follows the same gameplay formula as Dark Souls 3 with few new added mechanics that don't fundamentally change the gameplay. As a game it's derivative of its predecessors, the new elements rather than changing formula, feel like continuation of it. Open world Out of the all new elements, the open world aspect of the game is best realised. Instead of following usual practise of separating open-world activities and game progression. ER links game progression with exploration and makes its focus. At it's design core it follows principles of thoughtful minimalism and focus. Those combined together create a game world, in which player can navigate without utilising map. Instead player is visually lead and drawn to nearest objective or interesting places. What's impressive is that almost all major locations are visible from a distance, which helps to point player in right direction. The sheer scale and verticality of those location is spectacular. Instead of using elaborate illusions to make huge location like in previous games. ER aims to make its location fully explorable and massive at the same time. Addition of jumping button also allowed for more interesting and intricate level design. Royal Capital Leyndell is the pinnacle of this design - the biggest location in FROM games. Imagine Anor Londo or Yarhnam, but you can explore everything you see. With open world, ER also introduces an element of nonlinearity to the formula, which after Bloodborne became increasingly linear. This nonlinearity allows for greater build variety and gameplay freedom, player can beat almost any boss he wants in order he wants and pursue different rewards as a result. However, with this approach some corners had to be cut and as a result game reuses many assets and isn't as neatly balanced as previous titles.Crafting fits suprisingly well into gameplay loop. Not only it rewards exploration and incentives seeking new cookbooks, but most importantly it gives immadiate access to neccesary consumables without the need to farm them from the enemies as most of crafting resources are plenty and abundant in game world. Furthermore, this system is entirely optional, as crafting isn't tied to character progression and crafting selection is only limited to consumables and projectiles like arrows or knives. Not to mention many of said items are also sold by merchants and found on corpses. Combat ER builds upon and expands on DS 3 combat template. Most of major enemies and bosses follow the same design principles as DS3 enemies with thier delayed attacks and agressive combos. ER goes even further with this by making bosses even more agressive with more delayed attacks and smaller opening windows, some of them even adjust thier attack strings and behaviour to player inputs and position. This puts even more emphasis on evasion and swift attacks. In turn, this makes boss fights even more dynamic and engaging by forcing player to take risk and carfully find opportunities to strike instead of just waiting for a boss to finish his attacks. Furthermore, bosses have been specifically designed to punish the old habits of veteran souls players and to force them to adapt and change thier strategies to overcame the challenge. I feel like addition of summon ashes has negative impact on the game's balance. The enhanced enemy agression and input reading can be in-part explained as way to combat trivializing aspect of this system. As a result, I feel some of the battles were design and balanced with summon ashes in-mind, especially Crucible knights duo. Edit: they fixed this in issue in patch 1.04 by decreasing bosses aggression when they're in group and most obnoxious cases of input reading have been removed since. Summon ashes still are an easy mode, but now the game doesn't corner you to use it as much as before.Ashes of war system is great. It allows player to change weapon arts of armaments and thier scalling at the site of grace. it highly encourages experimentation and weapon switching. Amazing addition that creates even more build variety. Horse combat is entirely uninteresting and becomes dull very quickly. Fortunately, game rarely if ever forces player to fight on horse and majority of open-world bosses can be fought on foot. I think that Torrent was only added as means of transport and combat was just an afterthought. Conclusion Overall, Dark souls IV Elden Ring is natural conclusion of all previous FROM games. Fundamentally, It's just bigger and better than Bloodborne and Darksouls 3. However, this over adherence to already established formula hinders and restrains the studio's creative potential. I don't think they can follow same forumla endlessly. While ER is a great game, I wish they would experiment more with thier games, as it is they are starting to eat thier own tail.Finally, the most importantly I want Sellen to sit on my face",dark soul iiii jump button open world elden ring evolut establish design trend softwar studio er follow gameplay formula dark soul new ad mechan dont fundament chang gameplay game deriv predecessor new element rather chang formula feel like continu open world new element open world aspect game best realis instead follow usual practis separ openworld activ game progress er link game progress explor make focu design core follow principl thought minim focu combin togeth creat game world player navig without utilis map instead player visual lead drawn nearest object interest place what impress almost major locat visibl distanc help point player right direct sheer scale vertic locat spectacular instead use elabor illus make huge locat like previou game er aim make locat fulli explor massiv time addit jump button also allow interest intric level design royal capit leyndel pinnacl design biggest locat game imagin anor londo yarhnam explor everyth see open world er also introduc element nonlinear formula bloodborn becam increasingli linear nonlinear allow greater build varieti gameplay freedom player beat almost boss want order want pursu differ reward result howev approach corner cut result game reus mani asset isnt neatli balanc previou titlescraft fit suprisingli well gameplay loop reward explor incent seek new cookbook importantli give immadi access neccesari consum without need farm enemi craft resourc plenti abund game world furthermor system entir option craft isnt tie charact progress craft select limit consum projectil like arrow knive mention mani said item also sold merchant found corps combat er build upon expand ds combat templat major enemi boss follow design principl enemi thier delay attack agress combo er goe even make boss even agress delay attack smaller open window even adjust thier attack string behaviour player input posit put even emphasi evas swift attack turn make boss fight even dynam engag forc player take risk car find opportun strike instead wait boss finish attack furthermor boss specif design punish old habit veteran soul player forc adapt chang thier strategi overcam challeng feel like addit summon ash neg impact game balanc enhanc enemi agress input read inpart explain way combat trivial aspect system result feel battl design balanc summon ash inmind especi crucibl knight duo edit fix issu patch decreas boss aggress theyr group obnoxi case input read remov sinc summon ash still easi mode game doesnt corner use much beforeash war system great allow player chang weapon art armament thier scall site grace highli encourag experiment weapon switch amaz addit creat even build varieti hors combat entir uninterest becom dull quickli fortun game rare ever forc player fight hors major openworld boss fought foot think torrent ad mean transport combat afterthought conclus overal dark soul iv elden ring natur conclus previou game fundament bigger better bloodborn darksoul howev adher alreadi establish formula hinder restrain studio creativ potenti dont think follow forumla endlessli er great game wish would experi thier game start eat thier tailfin importantli want sellen sit face

The game likes when you don't buttonmash Visuals are stunning and have a style. Some areas might feel dark so just tweak your brightness if needed. Music and voice acting (Play with Chinese voice btw) are both ear candies. Story is exactly what you expect. A myth, a legend. A fairytale, if you want. No modern bs. Also, the monke. Cons: Performance is weird. One time you open up the game and it works with no framedrops and in *silky smooth* framerate, another time you may encounter a weird bug with 10 fps cap. I don't know what causes that but it solves itself with a restart. Invisible walls If you preordered the game - you can't level up the flask you get for it.Overall it's one of the greatest gaming experiences recently and it is worth the money you pay for it.

"2023 It doesn’t matter what I think of Elden Ring.This game sold over 20 million copies in a year. In the era of games as live service, it demonstrated that an incredibly difficult single-player experience can be a blockbuster. It’s Fromsoft's biggest hit and has cemented them as one of the most iconic developers of all time. The world has spoken - this game is great. The fact that I didn’t like it very much is totally irrelevant. But I value honesty in review, and in this case being honest means going against the grain. That’s kind of daunting as a reviewer - who among you is brave enough to critique the Mona Lisa, or Taylor Swift’s latest album? These sorts of juggernauts are hard to approach, but I’ve summoned up my courage, and I’m ready to be a contrarian.My first complaint is the switch to open world. The Dark Souls games are a series of branching corridors, with paths opening or closing dynamically. There’s a real sense of momentum pushing you forward from bonfire to bonfire, delving ever deeper into your own personal quest. It sets a mood both claustrophobic and expansive.Elden Ring, by contrast, feels too large. Simply following the critical path will get you maimed, so you’re encouraged to spend a lot of time just…wandering around the landscape. It’s a beautiful landscape to be sure, but there’s altogether too little happening in most of it. Liurnia in particular is a dull slog, but all of the areas suffer from a design that emphasizes scenery over a sense of flow.Speaking of a sense of flow, bosses also feel like a downgrade from previous titles. The core of the combat in these games is learning the attack patterns of your opponents. Starting with Sekiro, the design became a bit more ‘meta’; as we predict the bosses, the designers predict us right back. Things like, to use examples from the game, a stomp attack having a little leg hitch to draw out the animation unexpectedly, or a sword swing that is actually a bluff for a downward slam.These little ‘bait animations’ ruin the fun. Dark Souls felt good because the demon lifted his club to strike, you guessed the timing, and the demon missed you. Elden Ring, by contrast, will make the timing janky just to catch you. It moves the combat away from visual prediction and towards rote memorization, which lessens it. All of this could be easily forgiven if the story was gripping, and I was very optimistic on this front, considering George R.R Martin’s involvement. Sadly, the story is garbage, told poorly - and you know this to be true, because you watched a Youtube video in order to understand it, rather than go through the torture of trying to learn the lore through gameplay. Understanding the story is hours of disjointed investigative work, struggling through side quests that become uncompletable at a slight breeze and reading item descriptions for insufferably vague context clues. If it wasn’t for VaatiVidya and his ilk, we’d all be completely lost - that’s simply poor storytelling.It all felt like vague allusion for the sake of vague allusion. So much was left open to interpretation that the line between ‘loose end’ and ‘plot hole’ feels very blurred, which fundamentally weakens the narrative. Nobody’s motives are explicable and thus nobody’s motives are interesting. Elden Ring honestly just feels like a Dark Souls knock-off. One could argue that Bloodborne and Sekiro were the same, but to me, they felt like interesting and compelling innovations on the core mechanics established in Demon Souls. Elden Ring didn’t innovate. It just slapped on a coat of paint, went open world, and called it a day. Souls became Grace, Lords of Cinder became Rune Bearers, and mechanics were almost entirely rehashed from old titles. Boring!Ultimately, none of my complaints are important. 20 million copies, remember? This review is going to get drowned out by positive reviews from people who had a great 150 hours with this game, and honestly, that’s probably for the best. There’s clearly something really special here that a lot of people love, and that should be celebrated. But as a FromSoft fan, as an RPG fan, and as a fan of challenging combat games in general, I was left disappointed by Elden Ring.",doesnt matter think elden ringthi game sold million copi year era game live servic demonstr incred difficult singleplay experi blockbust fromsoft biggest hit cement one icon develop time world spoken game great fact didnt like much total irrelev valu honesti review case honest mean go grain that kind daunt review among brave enough critiqu mona lisa taylor swift latest album sort juggernaut hard approach ive summon courag im readi contrarianmi first complaint switch open world dark soul game seri branch corridor path open close dynam there real sens momentum push forward bonfir bonfir delv ever deeper person quest set mood claustrophob expansiveelden ring contrast feel larg simpli follow critic path get maim your encourag spend lot time justwand around landscap beauti landscap sure there altogeth littl happen liurnia particular dull slog area suffer design emphas sceneri sens flowspeak sens flow boss also feel like downgrad previou titl core combat game learn attack pattern oppon start sekiro design becam bit meta predict boss design predict us right back thing like use exampl game stomp attack littl leg hitch draw anim unexpectedli sword swing actual bluff downward slamthes littl bait anim ruin fun dark soul felt good demon lift club strike guess time demon miss elden ring contrast make time janki catch move combat away visual predict toward rote memor lessen could easili forgiven stori grip optimist front consid georg rr martin involv sadli stori garbag told poorli know true watch youtub video order understand rather go tortur tri learn lore gameplay understand stori hour disjoint investig work struggl side quest becom uncomplet slight breez read item descript insuffer vagu context clue wasnt vaatividya ilk wed complet lost that simpli poor storytellingit felt like vagu allus sake vagu allus much left open interpret line loos end plot hole feel blur fundament weaken narr nobodi motiv explic thu nobodi motiv interest elden ring honestli feel like dark soul knockoff one could argu bloodborn sekiro felt like interest compel innov core mechan establish demon soul elden ring didnt innov slap coat paint went open world call day soul becam grace lord cinder becam rune bearer mechan almost entir rehash old titl boringultim none complaint import million copi rememb review go get drown posit review peopl great hour game honestli that probabl best there clearli someth realli special lot peopl love celebr fromsoft fan rpg fan fan challeng combat game gener left disappoint elden ring

"Its Game of the Year 2024. This game delivers an experience so exceptional that it feels like a well-deserved slap in the face to certain Western developers and reviewers who criticized it.Wukong is simply too good, weaving a rich narrative that pulls you deep into the mystical world of Chinese mythology. It’s rare to find a game that not only captivates you with its plot but also keeps you engaged through its brilliant execution.Unreal Engine 5, the game pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in gaming graphics today. The visual fidelity is jaw-dropping, with every detail, from the smallest blade of grass to the most epic boss fights, rendered in stunning clarity. The environments are so immersive that you can almost feel the atmosphere and textures around you.The game also excels in its combat mechanics, though only a few boss fights truly test your skills. While some may find these battles challenging, they are a perfect blend of strategy and action, rewarding players who master the game’s intricacies.In a world where many games are starting to feel formulaic, Black Myth: Wukong stands out as a bold and innovative title. It fully utilizes the power of Unreal Engine 5 to deliver not just the best graphics of the year, but also an experience that feels new and exciting. This game is a testament to the talent and vision of its developers and a must-play for anyone looking for a truly unforgettable gaming experience.and do check my yt for some gameplay i have defeated every single boss of this game on - JPxDee",game year game deliv experi except feel like welldeserv slap face certain western develop review critic itwukong simpli good weav rich narr pull deep mystic world chines mytholog rare find game captiv plot also keep engag brilliant executionunr engin game push boundari what possibl game graphic today visual fidel jawdrop everi detail smallest blade grass epic boss fight render stun clariti environ immers almost feel atmospher textur around youth game also excel combat mechan though boss fight truli test skill may find battl challeng perfect blend strategi action reward player master game intricaciesin world mani game start feel formula black myth wukong stand bold innov titl fulli util power unreal engin deliv best graphic year also experi feel new excit game testament talent vision develop mustplay anyon look truli unforgett game experienceand check yt gameplay defeat everi singl boss game jpxdee

"2023 CA has lost all touch with reality and threatens to kill all support for the game if you don't buy the new DLC's at extreme prices, 150% price increase! This game has had awful support, broken patches and bugs, making campaigns and paid DLC unplayable.Avoid this game and don't give CA a dime, I'm a loyal fan for almost 20years for total war and I'm now officially not a fan, total war is dead. Total war warhammer 2 is just a better version of this game but with less factions.Edited to add some positives and more reviewing of the base game. Monogod factions were added in this game which was huge for me + the warrior of chaos rework was amazing with the DLC going with it totally being worth it. The base game campaign sucks ass, the worst I have ever played. The tutorial is cool and fun but basic. Immortal Empires is a miracle it even happened, the scope and potential this map carries is the dream of all warhammer players, to bad some parts don't work. Several campaigns are broken, features bugged, some DLC lords are unplayable (Nakai can't recruit Kroxigors which is his whole thing!).Immortal Empires is enjoyable still if you play what works and ignore visual bugs or run bugfixes by modders, thank you modders you are the best ever. I can still have fun with the game but would I recommend this game to anyone? No is my final verdict as I believe CA will only milk this game for money.

"This game has the feel and vibe of a game made in the late 2000s, early 2010s. The way the multiplayer and the PvE modes play wouldn't be out of place in that era, minus the graphics. This isn't as common nowadays, if at all. So in a weird way, it's a refreshing change that I don't hate at all.The game currently lacks any microtransactions, and apparently there's no concrete plans for modern microtransaction models. You want new cosmetics? Play the game modes. You want new weapons? Play the game modes. This is good. I like this.The gameplay feels similar to how the first Space Marine did, with significant improvements in some areas, and a few missteps. The biggest issue comes in the form of the difficulty, as some enemies are just obnoxiously too powerful on their own, with the methods that they swarm you making it all the worse to deal with. This really only is an issue I've found with the Tyranids. The moment you get to your second set of enemies, it's nowhere near as bad.Also what is the point of a heavy bolter if a simple SHIELD can stop it?",game feel vibe game made late earli way multiplay pve mode play wouldnt place era minu graphic isnt common nowaday weird way refresh chang dont hate allth game current lack microtransact appar there concret plan modern microtransact model want new cosmet play game mode want new weapon play game mode good like thisth gameplay feel similar first space marin signific improv area misstep biggest issu come form difficulti enemi obnoxi power method swarm make wors deal realli issu ive found tyranid moment get second set enemi nowher near badalso point heavi bolter simpl shield stop

"A masterpiece that is so rare in today's gaming landscape - reminiscent of a time we called the ""golden age of gaming"" with absolute Warhammer 40K brutality that we all love.Graphics• Incredible model detail everywhere• High fidelity and dense environments• Loincloth physics is 👌• World just looks amazingly beautiful - sheer scale 'shock and awe' at every horizonGameplay• Simple but satisfying, much polished from Space Marine I• Movement feels super satisfying and heavy as an Astartes should• Gunplay is impactful and smooth, though aiming feels a bit clunky at times due to the way it's configured• Melee is a transcendent experience, as the Emperor intended, with all the right splashes of red• Old school gaming feel, this plays like a true Space Marine successor/sequel shouldStory• Well-paced, Titus, Chairon, and Chadriel have some amazing moments in this campaign to save the Recidious System from annihilation by xenos and Choas scum alike• Background characters like Major Sarkaana, Cpt. Sevastus Acheran and others aboard the battle barge were all memorable in their own rights - though many Ultramarines don the same Primaris power armour their dialogues and faces behind the suit intrigued me enough to warrant their own spin-off campaigns if possible• World-building elements in the story campaign created a larger-than-life immersive experience, thanks to the attention-to-detail when designing the objects in the game - everything feels so authentic to the 41st millennium time period• Epic, grand, dazzling - are all words that are too small to describe the awe I felt when finishing the campaign, it was a religious experience to say the least• Too short, would have loved a longer campaign - easily finish-able in a day. Hopefully future expansions could be added that bring fourth more stories in this game/engine. Overall, this was the successor to Space Marine that was worth waiting 13 years for - in fact there was a time when this game would not have been possible and to see it and play it is a blessing and a great privilege.

"2023 Previous state ; toxic over-pricing practices mixed with reused assets being sold as new mechanics for new races while the core of the game suffers has made the new additions to the title not worth buying untill the main game is fixed. Developpers focus on a dead campaign mode instead of putting more love into the main played one - immortal empires. Not even mentioning CA openly THREATENING the playerbase in response to bad sales/reviews of latest dlc.My original review was ; ""not recommended"".Post last DLC state ; more older races from previous games got an pretty influencial upgrade up to the WH TW 3 standards, althou there is still some problems with power creep or dlc units/mechanics being much stronger than then ones left untouched. The updates still seem to be focused mainly for the new caracters/lords, and the old ones just get some reworked (already existing) mechanic or something made from what was already in game eq. cataclysm spells from the mirrors of madness mode. The vanilla game is better now (excluding some factions still needing much love and work - that are supposed to get it sooner or later), but some long term damage was done and a big bunch of great commiunity mods now are no longer being updated. And since CA tends to mess up their game scripts during updates - the modded game experience has been negatively affected, and patchfixes add more bugs than they fix.So far I still cant recommend going for a full 3 game experience with all dlc's at the full price.

"2022 2023 edit: Ignore the review bombing, this game is amazing. People are mad about the DLC, but the fact is as true as it's ever been; they don't have to buy DLC, the Immortal Empires campaign is still playable and the new factions will even come into your new game without buying as enemy factions, for free. The audacity of some of the more aggressive bashing is disturbing, and not supportive in fostering idea exchange, it just looks toxic.Game culture can be pretty rough when people disagree with direction, this is an industry truth, but ultimately this is an amazing game, I have several thousand hours of happy memories from TW:WH1 until now, and will continue to support them, but it's my choice to do so, if I didn't want to spend the money, it was never required, but the base game and FREE Immortal Empires updates are still one of the most aggressive and cool things I've seen.Dev team, I hope you see this, as one of your peers/competitors at another studio I want you to know that I think what you've done is very cool.

"2019 Competitive Matchmaking has been completely ruined by cheaters, Games are being HvH and legit players are caught in the middle, I gave this update a break seeing as it could've improved CS:GO as a whole but the cheating problem has gotten to the point that I don't even want to go near matchmaking. If you are looking for a better MM experience then FACEIT or ESEA are your best bet. Giving Prime to every user who bought the game was a total joke. Danger Zone isn't too bad but expect cheaters there too unfortunately and free to play users who wish to try CS are pretty much screwed too.This is the update that killed CS:GO.",competit matchmak complet ruin cheater game hvh legit player caught middl gave updat break see couldv improv csgo whole cheat problem gotten point dont even want go near matchmak look better mm experi faceit esea best bet give prime everi user bought game total joke danger zone isnt bad expect cheater unfortun free play user wish tri cs pretti much screw toothi updat kill csgo

"The overall gameplay is average. The combat is boring due to enemies being mindless and very easy to fight. You might as well just melee everything to death. The game is filled a weird mix of things that don't belong together, like these goofy cartoony pokemon things, but also generic horror creatures. To top things off, the game takes away your resources, weapons, and other items at the start of new seasons, and if you want to get your items back you have to pay. It's just a waste of time.",overal gameplay averag combat bore due enemi mindless easi fight might well mele everyth death game fill weird mix thing dont belong togeth like goofi cartooni pokemon thing also gener horror creatur top thing game take away resourc weapon item start new season want get item back pay wast time
"Overall fun game but not worth full price. The game has three modes: campaign, co-op, and PVP. Campaign mode is fun but it's short. There are several YouTubers who have uploaded a full playthrough that's only 6-10 hours. Co-op is decent but very grindy when it comes to unlocks. PVP is decent. I've only had two matches where the teams were evenly matched. Those were quite fun but most games are very one sided.

"Story:Nothing really that strong here when it comes to the story. You play as a monkey and look for the six parts of Sun Wukong’s spirit when it split. You don’t really know why you’re doing it, and characters don’t explain why. I’m not sure if the characters even know why. The story is as linear as it can get, but the lore is interesting. Characters pop in from time to time to give you an ability then they disappear. All linear and very straightforward. Not one of the strengths of this game.Graphics and environment:Some of the best graphics in this game. My set-up could run the game decently in High settings and it still looked great. As for the environments, this is where it gets frustrating. You can’t access places you think you can. There is no map, so you might get lost or forget what you were doing the last time before you died. Especially if you get far. I spent a lot of time just walking around in circles and trying to get in places you’re not allowed to.Gameplay:This is where the game shines the most. It excels with so many varied combos, skills and spells. If you master it, you become unstoppable and can sometimes beat bosses in the first try. The bosses are well-designed and unique. Some of them are really difficult. The customization is there, but it is limited to just after you beat some bosses. Some armor sets look great.Overall, this is a phenomenal game so far and I recommend it to anyone who likes GOW, Sekiro, Dark Souls, and any of their ilk.Ridiculously overpowered main and optional bosses that are almost invincible with buffs in a list longer than my d*ck.

"2022 The Realm of Chaos campaign is worth playing through once. It doesn't have a lot of replayability, as every playthrough, regardless of race, will play the same. You're trying to do your thing and then about every fifteen or twenty turns the world gets invaded by Chaos Daemons and you have to invade the realm of Chaos for a daemon's soul to eventually gain entrance into the Forge of Souls and either save or devour Kislev's god Ursun for your own ends. That said: the tension is real during the experience, you're constantly at odds with the clock and trying to get everything done in time is a fun experience, but it isn't something I'd like to subject myself to every playthrough. Play through it once then wait for the Immortal Empires addon that puts in all the content from the two previous games in the giant world map. I wish I could give it a neutral review but the gameplay itself is still solid enough to give it a recommendation.7/10 for Realm of Chaos Campaign, 8/10 for combat gameplay, Kislev a best.

有显著的优点，但也有极其恶劣的缺点。 优点 2~4章的战斗部分做的非常好。尤其是几位虎形态boss，做的都极好。虎先锋可以说牌面boss了，吊打黄金树幽影。 缺点 1. 地型0分。连最简单的关卡设计都没有。看着哪里都能去，哪里都是空气墙。在这样的情况下，制作组甚至不愿意给个小地图来弥补自己在场景设计方面的缺失。2. 地图尺寸与玩家移动速度不匹配。往哪走都是365里路，走到了又屁都没有。3. 美术也是跟地型一起的，0分。几乎所有的场景都是实拍，没有任何地方有美术设计的痕迹。4. 性能表现非常烂。这点跟上面3点是一起的。过于空旷的场景，毫无意义的地型和装饰物，严重拖累的玩家的机器性能。5. 隐藏要素过于阴间。不看攻略，根本无法找到。探索乐趣0分。6. 后期数据崩坏。后期一些boss长时间飞天放激光。7. 阴间掉落与个别阴间地型。8. 最终让我选择差评的原因是，垃圾剧情。也不知道从哪个二游挖过来的垃圾编剧，一坨大便。,

"2022 Update patch 2.0:Much better overall, IE release, massive bug fixing and optimization effort from CA, but still no cigar just yet.The most aggravating issues (except too few land battles, tedious slogs through minor settlements and incessant tower spamming which are still problems) have been tackled by now, this is how the game should have been released. But it took them a fair while and Immortal Empires reintroduced a plethora of new (or old) balance problems, bugs and features that don't work optimally (or at all). Every small ♥♥♥♥♥♥ alone would not amount to much but the heap is immense and will take them years to fully adresss. So still not a good look for a full-price Total War title. They're getting there, but slowly. Very slowly. If CA retains this vigour, I guess around Christmas it will be a good game, this time next year a great one even, but as of today my review will remain negative. But it's very close to the tipping point now. Original review:After two Warhammer titles we expected (and deserved) better. Much better!The omission of Immortal Empires at release was already a bitter pill to swallow, but then launching with a buggy, undercooked game with horrible performance, countless questionable design decisions and a severe lack of polish is definitely not a good look for a full price title.And taking a look at the roadmap (with ridiculously long ETAs), it's blatantly obvious that the main team already moved on to another project and the DLC team was left with the unthankful task of cleaning up this mess. Which in itself is another smack in the face of customers.I'm certain it will be a decent game in a few years. But if they want to achieve real greatness, Creative Assembly has got a huge workload before them.Until then it is definitely not recommandable, go play Warhammer 2 instead!",updat patch better overal ie releas massiv bug fix optim effort ca still cigar yetth aggrav issu except land battl tediou slog minor settlement incess tower spam still problem tackl game releas took fair immort empir reintroduc plethora new old balanc problem bug featur dont work optim everi small alon would amount much heap immens take year fulli adresss still good look fullpric total war titl theyr get slowli slowli ca retain vigour guess around christma good game time next year great one even today review remain neg close tip point origin reviewaft two warhamm titl expect deserv better much betterth omiss immort empir releas alreadi bitter pill swallow launch buggi undercook game horribl perform countless question design decis sever lack polish definit good look full price titleand take look roadmap ridicul long eta blatantli obviou main team alreadi move anoth project dlc team left unthank task clean mess anoth smack face customersim certain decent game year want achiev real great creativ assembl got huge workload themuntil definit recommand go play warhamm instead

"2023 I wanted to wait for the game to be properly fixed before leaving a positive review, but instead we get 1 year wait times between patches with 1 paid for DLC faction in particular being unplayable and unmentioned by CA when it's a 6 minute fix.Meanwhile they make a new game opening the door to micro transaction skinpacks, CA Zofia doing some good by going back to some of the old standards but then calling it innovative, Hyenas coming out with their beta on their exact release date of WH3's DLC, both competing with Starfield and Armored Core 6, while having record profits and releasing a statement to the community that the price for this lord pack needed to go up to match the already price hiked faction pack that had more content than this DLC, because of 'increased costs', needed to support this game they're barely supporting outside of DLC cycles.All this while the game still needs to be optimized and has a plethora of other CA is shooting themselves in the foot, holding the gun to the game's head threatening the community, hiding peoples' tweets that point out they received 5 million GBP from taxpayer money 'as a start-up company' and would have kept sticking their heads in the sand if people did not keep rioting, expecting people to let it blow over and keep consuming.

"""Black Myth: Wukong"" is not just an action-adventure game, but also a profound reinterpretation and expression of Chinese culture and mythology.The game's visuals are breathtaking. Every scene, every blade of grass is filled with intricate details. Whether it’s the lighting effects or texture quality, everything is executed with an exceptional level of craftsmanship. The development team has seamlessly blended ancient Chinese landscapes with the fantastical elements of mythology, creating a world that feels both familiar and refreshingly new.The combat system is incredibly deep, with each move designed to be extremely fluid and impactful.The enemy designs are also highly creative, with everything from ordinary demons to massive boss battles offering challenges that require both strategy and skill.In terms of story, the game faithfully recreates classic episodes from ""Journey to the West,"" while also incorporating a wealth of original content. Wukong’s journey is not just an adventure but a spiritual quest, with many dialogues and story elements that provoke deep thought.The music and sound effects are another highlight, with each piece of music perfectly setting the mood, from intense battles to peaceful villages, fully immersing you in the game’s atmosphere.",black myth wukong actionadventur game also profound reinterpret express chines cultur mythologyth game visual breathtak everi scene everi blade grass fill intric detail whether light effect textur qualiti everyth execut except level craftsmanship develop team seamlessli blend ancient chines landscap fantast element mytholog creat world feel familiar refreshingli newth combat system incred deep move design extrem fluid impactfulth enemi design also highli creativ everyth ordinari demon massiv boss battl offer challeng requir strategi skillin term stori game faith recreat classic episod journey west also incorpor wealth origin content wukong journey adventur spiritu quest mani dialogu stori element provok deep thoughtth music sound effect anoth highlight piec music perfectli set mood intens battl peac villag fulli immers game atmospher
"Space Marine 2Let me preface by saying this is more a list of pros and cons and is biased entirely towards the melee experience, I have played Assault religiously. I love real difficulty, not the artificial crap but the real stuff. Payday 2 DSOD, VM2 Cataclysm and Onslaught, Darktide Auric Storm and countless other hellish experiences. Space Marine 2 absolutely has the ability to deliver this with some fine-tuning in the future but the current experience is rough around the edges the longer you play and advance. Despite that, I believe this game is worth it, and the developers should be supported.Pros: An incredibly beautiful and heartfelt experience, the developers actively listen and respond to the community, clearly care about the source material and they've created some of the most beautiful graphics to immerse yourself in the carnage.Melee combat just clicks, perfect parries, perfect dodges, gunstrikes, beautiful executions. The first few hours you play will blow your mind away, not to mention the difficulty and initial learning curve is perfect.Cons: Critical flaws in the nuances of the pure melee experience: I'd be here all day breaking this down but to put it as simple as possible: If there were 50 melee enemies after me, I can and have beat them before with use of all the aforementioned mechanics alongside the memorised combos they do, but if you were to add just even 3 small ranged units shooting me 50 metres away, I'm dead in probably 20 seconds and there is nothing skillful I can do to counter this as Assault, my preferred class. Assault is easily the weakest because it lacks utility, functionality, and a worthwhile ability; the strongest and most efficient use of the Assault's jump-pack is to simply stall and run away when the chips are down so you can get reinforcements. Vanguard mogs Assault having played both classes, not just in melee efficiency but in immense measurable utility for yourself and team. Spongy and nonreactive enemy rosters: Did I mention they take countless melee attacks? They do not give a damn. Thunderhammer in their face? They do not care, they will just attack. Jump pack attack or charged attack? Nah they get Insane I-frame dodges that break your tracking and teleports that can actually send them behind walls and covers and allow them to instantly counter attack with an unblockable flame attack, SUCK IT Astartes trash! Behold the trickery of Tzeentch! Thousand sons roster: Take every con I've mentioned, now play on the hardest difficulty, now crank it from a 7 to an 11. They. Are. Overtuned. The issues of a pure melee experience is exasperated 100-fold when you play assault against them. Every Majoris enemy will teleport away before you can kill them with melee, this becomes a problem when they teleport off-screen or into a pack of 20 other different chaos marines. You will whittle them down slowly but never be able to efficiently take them down, though this feels very in their ballpark, it just feels plain bad. At least give me a way to counter this. Here is the irony, Extremis thousand sons are easier to kill. Yeah, no seriously, they really are, I can easily parry and perfect dodge their moves and finish them off because they do not teleport away. Every single unit is overtuned.TZAANGORS: IF YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW. I HAVE SPENT 10 ENTIRE SECONDS PRESSING NOTHING BUT PARRY, REACTING TO THEIR JUMPS. THERE IS 0 COUNTERPLAY OR OPPORTUNITY BEYOND THIS, ANY OTHER OPTION WILL RESULT IN HEALTH LOSS. THEY WILL ACTIVELY DISREGARD ANY ATTACK YOU DO AGAINST THEM, HYPER ARMOUR OUT THE WAZOO. No probs if you have a melta though, looking at you Vanguard.Cheap Chinese Crap: The manufactorium unfortunately, does not provide. Instead we have the ali-express power armour that disintegrates when even looked at the wrong way.

"When I first launched the game and started playing the tutorial, I didn't think the game was that bad. I thought the game play was OK and I thought the graphics were pretty good and there were aspects to the combat that I kind of liked, but then after I get into the world and start playing around with the building, I noticed that you have to use the memetics to unlock all this ♥♥♥♥ to build a base and it's incredibly frustrating that i can't build simple things such as walls or doors without unlocking it in memetics first i can understand that for higher tier weapons and base equipment, but even though they're easy to unlock its the fact that I simply can't build basic things like that is dumb. Another thing that I don't like about the game is the fact that I am locked into one server. I am unable to create a new character and am forced to play this one server I selected. I'm sure these features will be changed in the Future but until then I would not play this game.",first launch game start play tutori didnt think game bad thought game play ok thought graphic pretti good aspect combat kind like get world start play around build notic use memet unlock build base incred frustrat cant build simpl thing wall door without unlock memet first understand higher tier weapon base equip even though theyr easi unlock fact simpli cant build basic thing like dumb anoth thing dont like game fact lock one server unabl creat new charact forc play one server select im sure featur chang futur would play game

Good graphics (although the animation is far from realistic) but the gameplay gets old soon after Chapter 2. Starting at Chapter 3 the storyline is so thin that there is pretty much no logical reason for most of the boss encounters. The attention to detail is also lacking in programming the maps and basic actions. E.g. there are invisible walls everywhere yet there are places the character can fall or get stuck so easily.,good graphic although anim far realist gameplay get old soon chapter start chapter storylin thin pretti much logic reason boss encount attent detail also lack program map basic action eg invis wall everywher yet place charact fall get stuck easili

"Elden Ring is one of those games that you just need to play at least once in your life. It's probably the closest to an actual work of art mixed in with a combo of some of FromSoft's previous games.The game's music and art direction is so perfect for the setting being presented, and felt incredibly immersive for me. The music feels as though it belongs in a movie with how dramatic and beautiful it sounds. Probably the best in FromSoft's lineup of games in my opinion. Elden Ring's art direction is also phenomenal in about every way. The only gripe I have about it, although it may be just my own opinion, is that some parts and areas get a tad redundant and some parts recycle enemies and ideas from other sections, but it's not enough to say it's bad. Open world in the game is also pretty interesting and does a decent job making sure the player always has something to do, and of course has some of the best vistas I've seen in a game. Honestly I took a little too many screenshots it's so good lmao. Seeing parts of the map that I couldn't get to made me explore looking for ways to get to where I wanted/needed to go, and rather than just being a straight shot to my destination, the game always threw a number of different things that would get me sidetracked and I'd end up going on like three other whole little adventures before doing what I set out to do. It's very good for an open world.The gameplay, I think, is a great combo of Dark Souls, Bloodbourn, and even Sekiro thrown in. FromSoft seems as though they wanted to bring the best of their older games into one, and did that they did. It really opens up the world for exploration, brings out the most interesting combat to always keep you on your toes, and has amazing locations that allow for exploration so you can find different paths through the area with many goodies to find. The story is about as insane as you'd expect. It's FromSoft.The game's insanely good, if you're reading this just thinking about getting the game just get it.

"2022 Nearly 800 hours in Tw2 and after 8 in Tw3 I've decided to go back to the older game for my warhammer fix. All the bugs and poor performance have just turned me off. For example spent the last 10 minutes watching my Cathay units fail to path find anywhere and just turn in circles followed by the battle in which I watched both my own and enemy troops clip into and out of walls and barricades and fail to engage in combat just weirdly sliding past each other. I'm going to just put this one down and come back to it in a few months as it is I can't recommend it. I love warhammer in general collecting several tabletop armies and buying figurative bucket loads of warhammer digital games but even being a ""Super Fan"" I still can't get into this one.EDIT: The game is just kinda here for me after giving it a long while to play it I just can't get into like the previous titles.

"Overall, a really solid game with a few things holding it back.It's got an excellent combat system that allows for all levels of skill expression, where you can use everything the game gives you for lore-accurate Wukong or none at all if you feel the abilities trivialize encounters. The skill tree system is well done which allows you to create a playstyle that fits you, and the ability for players to reset it for free encourages experimentation.Bosses are the main focus of the game, and level & mob enemy design is sacrificed in favor of that. Most levels are just smashing through weak mob enemies until you reach a boss. This design isn't inherently bad, but I would've loved to see more engaging enemies, creative placements of those enemies, and better environment design so there aren't invisible walls.For a developer that is making a game of this scale for the first time, they definitely got a lot of things right.",overal realli solid game thing hold backit got excel combat system allow level skill express use everyth game give loreaccur wukong none feel abil trivial encount skill tree system well done allow creat playstyl fit abil player reset free encourag experimentationboss main focu game level mob enemi design sacrif favor level smash weak mob enemi reach boss design isnt inher bad wouldv love see engag enemi creativ placement enemi better environ design arent invis wallsfor develop make game scale first time definit got lot thing right

"Now that I've 100% the game and can only derive enjoyment from Legendary (Campaign Difficulty) /Very Hard (Battle Difficulty) anymore I think I can finally leave a well rounded review.This is definitely one of those games that I wish steam had a ""Neutral"" review option for. To give you an idea of where my thoughts are coming from, I have over a thousand hours across the Total War Series and started over a decade ago in middle school with Medieval II.This is easily the most diverse of the franchise by far with the variety of races and the rosters for each one, and it has an incredibly good modding scene. The battles are as cinematic as it gets, and the game is beautiful on max settings. This entry in the franchise also has the most robust multiplayer campaign with the player slots going up to 10 (Medieval III multiplayer campaigns please.) The variety of lords, heroes, schools of magic, and tech trees for all the races allows for a variety of playstyles as well. However, it's really more of an illusion of choice, because when it comes down to it each Legendary Lord has their bread and butter to the point that with all the stat buffs you get between perks and research you'll steamroll armies that are composed of units that ARE SUPPOSED TO COUNTER YOU. Agents (Heroes) will 99% of the time be incorporated in your armies and be objectively better as a battlefield unit than for their campaign map purposes (I've beaten multiple legendary campaigns without utilizing an agent on the campaign map even once, which I feel shows their lack of impact if they're just a side option instead of being absolutely essential for well rounded play.) Sieges (and settlement battles) honestly feel like a downgrade from previous titles. Medieval II did it perfectly with multi-layered citadels, dedicated military settlements being entirely different than cities, etc. In this game there's multiple scenarios where you attack with a lord that just gets a free ""destroy castle wall"" button right at the beginning of the battle. You should have an inherent STRONG advantage as a defender in a siege situation, and this game just doesn't facilitate that at all.The largest issue this games suffers from (which plagues essentially every game of the 4x/RTS genre by the way, I just need to point it out here), is difficulty scaling. The AI is DUMB. Want to make the game harder? Give them every cheat known to man stats wise. The only thing AI really know how to do is attack move their entire army at you. Even on Legendary they will regularly send full stacks to their death by initiating battles against you they don't even have any chance of winning (And I don't just mean in battle by the way, I mean the autoresolve will be an 80/20 split in your favor and the AI still attack for some reason).The game is fun, I'll continue to experiment with mods and play with friends when they ask, but when it comes down to it once you crack the formula there's really no situation where you haven't really won the campaign by turn 50-60 and would just continue it for the sake of reaching the tedious win conditions of a Long Victory. (Which vary WILDLY, Wood Elves and Norsca were beyond annoying to complete whereas Chaos Dwarves I beat a Legendary campaign as Zhatan the Black in 2 hours.)The core gameplay loop sees you essentially solve the first 10 turn puzzle for each Legendary Lords start, and once you're able to do that consistently, that illusion of depth for the game shatters and you're left with a quick 30 minutes of conquering and then an end turn simulator as you sweep through the map.I DO recommend this game, the Warhammer lore is one of my favorite universes, and is done extreme justice here. The game is definitely enjoyable up until the point that you've mastered it, and you'll get your money's worth for that time.

"if you're checking to see whether this game is worth the price: the game is fun and has plenty of replayability, but the base game alone entitles you to a small fraction of the content in the game, so you'll need to sink a lot of money into overpriced DLC. always buy at a discount, and be aware that around a quarter of this game's factions can only be unlocked by buying the other games in the trilogy, even if you buy all the DLC for this game.if you're a strategy gamer wondering whether this is a good buy: yes, but not at the normal price, and don't expect the game to play like a historical Total War game. this is a Total War game in a darwinian high fantasy setting, and the gameplay has adapted well. this game is set in the world of Warhammer Fantasy, an old tabletop game that mostly exists nowadays as a collection of licensed video games, but you won't need to have read the sourcebooks because what little story there is is explained in-game and much of it was written for this game. in short, this game takes place in a temporally-fluid pastiche of our world somewhere between the industrial revolution and several centuries BC, but with magic, polytheism, a looming invasion by demons, demon cultists & ratmen, and stereotypical fantasy species pasted over any race that isn't european or chinese. warhammer's analogue of america is populated by a race of backstabbing slavers who became psychopaths, turned on their majestic brethren overseas and now get off on torturing people. take that as you will.returning players from historical Total War might find that the gameplay feels off, and i agree - i personally find that the less realistic design philosophy does cause me to visualize battles as two sets of stat blocks crashing into each other in arbitrary configurations rather than a test of wits between two forces whose units behave intuitively according to appearance. on the other hand, intuition inherently goes out the window to a degree when the game balance was determined by tabletop game designers rather than a collection of centuries-old military records - there's a good reason the human mind is disinclined to believe that a loosely arranged mob of naked people with whips can hope to defeat an equal quantity of heavy infantry with zweihänders. if you're a fan of naval battles, you should know that this game has no naval gameplay, despite having playable pirates (vampire coast), vikings (norsca) and british people (high elves). the only ships in the game are the transport fleets that all armies store in their asses at all times next to their siege ladders, and if two opposing armies meet at sea, they will agree to park at a nearby island and disembark to fight on land. the closest thing to a navy in this game is the dark elves' black arks, mobile settlements that provide ground troops and shore bombardment to friendly armies.the game's only campaign at launch (tutorial excepted) was Realm of Chaos, a narratively-driven race against the other major factions to invade the titular realm and reach the wounded god Ursun, taking place along the northern latitudes of the world. the main attraction of total war: warhammer III, however, is Immortal Empires, a more traditional Total War campaign that combines the three campaign maps from the total war: warhammer trilogy into one large map spanning almost the entire Warhammer Fantasy world. this campaign contains over 200 factions (though the majority are minor NPC factions that exist to be trampled by or absorbed into playable factions), and the world's races are as diverse to fight as or against as they look.there are plenty of playable factions with radically different playstyles and campaign mechanics. every race has a different core strategy in battle, a different approach to empire-building on the strategic map, and emphasize different mechanics. within each race, most factions have a distinct gimmick intended to encourage different uses of the same unit roster or change the player's diplomatic priorities. i'd feel comfortable saying that every faction in this game feels more unique to play than Rome does in Rome 2, and it is almost always better to do realpolitik and set war goals instead of just dividing the world into enemies and future enemies.however, expect to drop several hundred dollars on DLC for this game, and the integrated content from the previous games in the trilogy, if you're interested in playing anyone other than Cathay (fantasy imperial china), Kislev (fantasy imperial russia) or the daemons of chaos (fantasy florida). if you got into Total War through the pre-Empire games like I did, I would recommend picking up the first game in the trilogy (yes, the base game), which will unlock some of the more accessible races in Immortal Empires if you own both games. Reikland or Couronne will ease you in with gameplay familiar to players of historical total war, and the Vampire Counts will force you to adapt. also consider buying the second game to unlock the Knights of Caledor, which is objectively the best faction. owning all three games, without buying any DLC, will unlock around two thirds of Immortal Empires' playable races. some factions within those races will remain paywalled, but this is more than enough content to get a feel for the game.i would advise you to keep a firm grip on your wallet around this trilogy. more than one DLC has been controversial among consumers for high prices & thin content, and the developers have made a grand number of PR blunders, although they have recently been working to reverse their reputation by releasing new content for the Shadows of Change DLC. if, however, you can build up your DLC library and adapt to each faction's gimmick, there are easily 10,000 hours of gameplay before you've seen everything.though they shouldn't factor into your purchase decision, i feel the need to mention mods, given how critical they are to the experience of playing this game. here's a brief primer, so you're not quite as lost if you choose to get into the modding scene: the steam workshop has a rich selection of mods to add new playable factions with unique mechanics, or revamp minor factions to have unique leaders and gimmicks. the community does its best to ensure cross-compatibility between mods (mostly by having every mod author bother one particular person to edit startpos.esf on their behalf), and i enjoy seeing how many mods i can stuff the game with without breaking it. be aware that the owners of the Warhammer IP do not allow workshop content referencing IPs outside of Warhammer Fantasy, so most mods add either original content or canon content that does not appear in vanilla. Mixu's Unlocker, Victory Conditions Overhaul, Heroes of Legend and the suite of faction mods from Team OvN are essential, even if you're not looking for a heavily modded experience. if you are, mods can more than double this game's playtime - just don't expect mods to carry the game if you're not sold on vanilla, and don't install SFO: Grimhammer unless you fancy begging for a compatibility patch whenever you want to use any other mod. consider downloading the fan-made Warhammer 3 Mod Manager if you intend to play with more than a handful of mods; it makes it a hell of a lot easier to figure out which mod is crashing your game or causing conflicts.in summary: it's a good game that will last you a long time, but has a very different design philosophy from the historical games. faction variety is unparalleled. there's a deep pool of mods to choose from, and you can pack a lot of content into one playthrough, as long as you know what you're doing. you will need to make a lot of purchases to get the full experience, however - 20 DLC packs and counting, plus both of the previous games in the trilogy - so be prepared to wait for sales or look for discounted steam keys on

"2023 As a long time Total War Warhammer player, I am hugely disappointed by the direction adapted by the game developer with regard to what should have been the pinnacle of the trilogy. Long known bugs & issues are just ignored (luckily mod creators are doing a fantastic job at fixing most of them). The patch cycles we saw in WH1 and WH2, that included free high quality additional content, has been discontinued (a CA post from last year point to a single person working on patches...).Finally, although I may not fully criticize the new pricing policy with regard to DLCs (I may simply not pay for them if I think it's not worth my money, something that for now seems to be true), I am shocked by the subtle threat made by the developer to discontinue WH3 support, if the community does not respond positively to new DLCs (in my opinion an empty threat, very very disrespectful to the fans and the community nevertheless).I love the series and hope that CA returns to deliver high quality content. Although all strategy fans should experience this amazing series, as of now, during the Shadows of Change DLC controversy, it feels very wrong to recommend the game to new players.",long time total war warhamm player huge disappoint direct adapt game develop regard pinnacl trilog long known bug issu ignor luckili mod creator fantast job fix patch cycl saw includ free high qualiti addit content discontinu ca post last year point singl person work patchesfin although may fulli critic new price polici regard dlc may simpli pay think worth money someth seem true shock subtl threat made develop discontinu support commun respond posit new dlc opinion empti threat disrespect fan commun neverthelessi love seri hope ca return deliv high qualiti content although strategi fan experi amaz seri shadow chang dlc controversi feel wrong recommend game new player

"2022 Fantastic game that suffers from open world syndrome of having quantity over quality with all the mini-dungeons in the game (at least the loot is good). The quests are all pretty interesting in their own ways and 9 times out of 10 it is fairly rewarding to follow the questlines. Boss fights are for the most part easier than the previous souls games, however in some cases they can be more difficult, especially if you don't use the ash summons (they intend and definitely encourage you to use them however).Enemy reuse is really bad in this game, ranging from simply reusing enemies from previous games to reusing main story big bads (with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moveset) in random dungeons and reusing the enemies (mini-bosses) which are new to this game except now there's two, oh and now there's three of them, and oh there he is again, and again, and again, now he's a common enemy. The horse is also too strong and honestly doesn't add much to the game besides allowing you to platform higher I guess.In any case, the game is still fun if you like souls games, and this is exactly that, just more souls except with a different name and a much bigger (for better or for worse) scale.

It's enemies are very diverse and spread out, they added them into this world and blended them in well. With the enhanced graphics from previous titles it makes the atmosphere feel relaxing or ominous with the day/night cycle and weather. This game is definitely not easy but its not insanely difficult.

"2022 Just finished a Cathay campaign. Two strong impressions: 1. Siege battles feel much more fun because of the new multi-layer settlements maps and supply mechanic to build defense structures. 2. Quest battles are also very enjoyable, having to capture multiple victory points and hold them against enemies waves, meanwhile you have supply points to build defense structure, call in reinforcements, and buff/heal units mid-battle. Downside is that these battles are quite long now.The new siege battles are definitely more fun than before if you are defending. You can build defense structures like towers, traps, and barricades. And the new settlements map are huge and complex with multi-layer pathways and many interesting choke points. This opens up many interesting strategies to turn defeats into heroic victories. I was able to win many outnumbered defense battles by holding crucial choke points and maneuver my army through multiple lines of defenses to wear enemies down. Cathay crossbows felt so strong when you have them positioned on higher grounds and having your melee units hold the enemies down. The downsides are these battles are sometimes very long (because of how big the new maps are), and attackers do feel harder to play (if you don't take supply point, the defenders can constantly build towers, traps, and etc.).The quest battles are also more interesting now. You have to capture several locations sequentially and after each capture, you have 45 sec to build defenses and layout your army against a coming enemy wave. These battles are super fun because you need to play as both attacker and defender--you capture points from enemies and then defend them against them who are trying to take them back. You can also call in reinforcements, heal, restock, or buff your units mid-battle using supply points which are passively generated. The maps are also huge, with interesting terrains and choke points where you can leverage to either hold points or push through enemy defenses. The final battle also have interesting mechanics: (XD Annoying or Fun very subjective) 1. Constant spawning of enemy troops behind you after taking first points. Forcing you to take next victory point quickly while hold up against enemies chasing behind you. 2. Random enemy teleport onto final victory point(soulgrinders into the middle of your army). This scared me so hard since these giant , nonstoppable monstrous machines just started spawning and running through my crossbows at the end. Downside is still the same: The battles can feel long--easily 30+ min.As for optimization, I honestly feel it is similar to Total War Warhammer II, occasional FPS drops, especially on the campaign . I did not experience anything major that stopped me from playing it. The only bug I encounter was that a few of the rifts I closed somehow reopened after I reloaded the save file the next day. I was able to enjoying the game, and I don't really expect any more optimization improvement.

"2023 First of all, if you enjoy strategy games, fantasy games or Warhammer or Total War titles in general, you are almost sure to enjoy this game too. You can easily sink hundreds of hours into Total War Warhammer 3, especially if you buy the right additional content. I have, in all three games combined, around 2000 hours myself.However I cannot with good conscience recommend this dumpster fire of a game unless you can find absolutely no other games to enjoy. It is unfortunately rotten to its core and I don't see any way for the developers to fix it. I sincerely hope future games will do a better job, but this one does not deserve your time. Why, you ask? Well, both sides of the gameplay are just so glaringly inadequate. First, this game is all about capturing settlements with your armies. That constitutes 90% of your campaign goals, that is how you grow your empire and make more money etc. So battles using said armies and for said settlements should probably be the best feature of the game... Right? WRONG! Some of the battles are so bad that even trying to write about them right now makes me furious. The variety in battles is amazing, but that causes the poorly programmed AI armies to flounder more often than not. In field battles, the enemy units will try to repeatedly get into new formations, neither defending against your incursions nor advancing on you. It is somehow less competent in higher battle difficulties. Once you get the hang of it, more often than not, you can destroy whole armies of elite troops with only a couple of units of your own. As for the battles taking place in settlements... I don't think I could do justice to how awful the AI becomes. If you don't take my word for it, I suggest you watch some gameplay online that demonstrates this debaucle; there are plenty of such videos and streams. The layout of the settlements also boggles the mind. Every infantry unit features magically appearing ladders aptly dubbed by the community ""butt ladders,"" making the walls trivial, the design of which are already pretty senseless by themselves. Inside the settlements you have fixed spots where you can build barricades and towers using some vague resource that you accumulate over time. The location of those defenses can be absolutely insane (like towers blocked by buildings on all sides, rendering them useless), the pathfinding would have been considered terrible even in a game 10 years old, and the so called victory points ... Oh my god, it is just so bad. SO BAD. Even the simplest tower defense flash game has better design than these battles - which are not even supposed to be like tower defense battles! They are supposed to reflect real siege battles in a reasonable fashion. They. Just. Don't. These battles were actually so badly received by the community that one update removed most settlement battles and replaced them with field battles. The campaign management is also laughably stupid. Campaign in Total War games has never been on par with other major turn based strategy titles like Civilization, of course, because this series also supposed to feature amazing real time battles. But in the Warhammer series, it is dumbed down lower than imaginable. Though some mechanics introduced in the overpriced paid DLCs are very interesting, all the basic features are largely unimaginative and lazy. Call me crazy, but I think such an essential part of a 60-dollar strategy game should be at least halfway decent without having to pay for any additional content. Diplomacy is mostly a joke; only one deal in a hundred that you make requires any strategical thinking. It is admittedly better in TWW3 than in TWW1 and 2, but not because it is now of a higher quality, but because you are now forced to waste less time on it thanks to quick diplomacy and auto-balance options. Most of the races from the first and second games either have not had updates to adjust them to the third game or said updates do not function properly: It is clear from the lackluster skill lines of older characters, missing features in the mechanics, incompatible and insufficient adjustments to the new diplomacy options and other interactions between factions etc. that no real thought has been put into how these factions should play together in the new game. It is like comparing a well made article of clothing to one with weird patches all over it; you can clearly see that the patches don't belong, which makes the cloting seem very cheap and unattractive. Not to mention that many of the updates the game receives just do not work. There have been dozens of critical issues that the developers claimed to have fixed in a patch, which turned out to be blatant lies, like FIVE TIMES IN A ROW. I refuse to believe that they do any testing before releasing these updates. And there remains a buttload of important problems that they are yet to even acknowledge. Again, you will probably have fun in this game despite all these issues (and more). Of course, you will likely get bored and fatigued by your campaign by the mid game and either start a new campaign before you get to the good stuff or stop playing for a while. That is what happens to most players.",first enjoy strategi game fantasi game warhamm total war titl gener almost sure enjoy game easili sink hundr hour total war warhamm especi buy right addit content three game combin around hour myselfhowev good conscienc recommend dumpster fire game unless find absolut game enjoy unfortun rotten core dont see way develop fix sincer hope futur game better job one deserv time ask well side gameplay glaringli inadequ first game captur settlement armi constitut campaign goal grow empir make money etc battl use said armi said settlement probabl best featur game right wrong battl bad even tri write right make furiou varieti battl amaz caus poorli program ai armi flounder often field battl enemi unit tri repeatedli get new format neither defend incurs advanc somehow less compet higher battl difficulti get hang often destroy whole armi elit troop coupl unit battl take place settlement dont think could justic aw ai becom dont take word suggest watch gameplay onlin demonstr debaucl plenti video stream layout settlement also boggl mind everi infantri unit featur magic appear ladder aptli dub commun butt ladder make wall trivial design alreadi pretti senseless insid settlement fix spot build barricad tower use vagu resourc accumul time locat defens absolut insan like tower block build side render useless pathfind would consid terribl even game year old call victori point oh god bad bad even simplest tower defens flash game better design battl even suppos like tower defens battl suppos reflect real sieg battl reason fashion dont battl actual badli receiv commun one updat remov settlement battl replac field battl campaign manag also laughabl stupid campaign total war game never par major turn base strategi titl like civil cours seri also suppos featur amaz real time battl warhamm seri dumb lower imagin though mechan introduc overpr paid dlc interest basic featur larg unimagin lazi call crazi think essenti part strategi game least halfway decent without pay addit content diplomaci mostli joke one deal hundr make requir strateg think admittedli better higher qualiti forc wast less time thank quick diplomaci autobal option race first second game either updat adjust third game said updat function properli clear lacklust skill line older charact miss featur mechan incompat insuffici adjust new diplomaci option interact faction etc real thought put faction play togeth new game like compar well made articl cloth one weird patch clearli see patch dont belong make clote seem cheap unattract mention mani updat game receiv work dozen critic issu develop claim fix patch turn blatant lie like five time row refus believ test releas updat remain buttload import problem yet even acknowledg probabl fun game despit issu cours like get bore fatigu campaign mid game either start new campaign get good stuff stop play happen player
"Campaign:Great Cinematic experience, better with friends, very cool.Only low point I can think of are the ""Rats"" section of the 2nd mission and some downtime sections from the ""Cave"" mission.PvP:It's ok, a bit death-bally and significantly less emphasis on Melee in my short experience with it.I didn't have much interest in it before and quickly lost interest in it, so I haven't played a lot of rounds nor grind each classes to unlock their other, more interesting weapons.(Co-)Operations:Only having 6 missions on launch is terrible, -Tide games and World War Z had more on launch in the past and needed more content.It is early, but the balance seemed all over the place. At the higher difficulties, there are fewer resources and sometimes placement of Ammo Crates, it felt similar to the tactical survival experience of Back 4 Blood, World War Z, and maybe like playing Remnant 2 with a non-S/ A-Tier build but instead using a sub-optimal life-leech build. Regardless of the difficulty, missions have RNG aspects to it such as the mid-level events requiring 1-6 sub-objectives to complete.You have to ration your ammo in specific parts of certain missions and try to use the environment and equipment you find as optimally as possible (explosive barrels, explosive flowers, and level gimmicks such as the fire wall at the end of the first mission).Enemies becomes bullet spongy at higher difficulties and are more numerous, with less resources spawning, and Medicae Stims healing less HP. Different weapon types seem to have different effectiveness vs specific enemies. Running away to the next airlock/ elevator to despawn enemies behind you is cheesy but effective.Perk and class balance seemed to be all over the place, but I need to play more to be sure, and there seems to be some bugs or hidden effects (Bulwark fully-healing after using Loadout change pods and their banner phasing through the lift in a mission). Examples for balance stuff: - Certain classes have ammo generation perks later on in their class (or weapon perk line) which seems to be a mandatory pick compared to the other options; - Bulwark's Level 8 perk restores max contested health for squadmates in the AoE, allowing you to partially/ fully heal when combined with an enemy execution/ finisher, and the level 23 perk shares this with squadmates anywhere, which substantially reduces the need for healing items (and again, seems like a mandatory pick compared to the other options); - Weapons with high damage per shot that can hit multiple enemies can heal past contested health (e.g. Melta Rifle, Las Fusil, etc).Also you use the same currency to buy weapons, class perks, and Space Marine Chapter Customization and you always feel poor while progressing initially, with some classes having more expensive weapons (e.g. Assault). You also need to grind each class and weapons types.Additionally, trying to get an Armory Data to unlock the next tier of weapons for the first time will be tougher than usual as you need to play the higher tier with previous tier weapons.",campaigngreat cinemat experi better friend coolonli low point think rat section mission downtim section cave missionpvpit ok bit deathbal significantli less emphasi mele short experi iti didnt much interest quickli lost interest havent play lot round grind class unlock interest weaponscooperationsonli mission launch terribl tide game world war z launch past need contentit earli balanc seem place higher difficulti fewer resourc sometim placement ammo crate felt similar tactic surviv experi back blood world war z mayb like play remnant non atier build instead use suboptim lifeleech build regardless difficulti mission rng aspect midlevel event requir subobject completey ration ammo specif part certain mission tri use environ equip find optim possibl explos barrel explos flower level gimmick fire wall end first missionenemi becom bullet spongi higher difficulti numer less resourc spawn medica stim heal less hp differ weapon type seem differ effect vs specif enemi run away next airlock elev despawn enemi behind cheesi effectiveperk class balanc seem place need play sure seem bug hidden effect bulwark fullyh use loadout chang pod banner phase lift mission exampl balanc stuff certain class ammo gener perk later class weapon perk line seem mandatori pick compar option bulwark level perk restor max contest health squadmat aoe allow partial fulli heal combin enemi execut finish level perk share squadmat anywher substanti reduc need heal item seem like mandatori pick compar option weapon high damag per shot hit multipl enemi heal past contest health eg melta rifl la fusil etcalso use currenc buy weapon class perk space marin chapter custom alway feel poor progress initi class expens weapon eg assault also need grind class weapon typesaddit tri get armori data unlock next tier weapon first time tougher usual need play higher tier previou tier weapon

"One must imagine Skarbrand happy. So where to begin? Back in 2014-2015 this got revealed, this being Total War: Warhammer, and it was a step in a new direction for Total War albeit one that wasn't that unusual since there have been Warhammer mods for other Total War games. And with Warhammer its frequently about huge armies clashing, even in 40K, and whilst you may not have 100,000 individual units, it still fit. However it was a massively risky move since it was a departure from historical Total War games.Yet it worked.Whilst TWW is still rough in some ways, I know it can be a lot of times for too arcade-y for me, I keep coming back and playing it. I attribute this to the fact that its weakness is also its strength, the arcadey-ness. I also attribute this to the fact that its practically, currently, the best Warhammer RTS game that actually has to do with Fantasy Battles, not even the Old World, which is Fantasy Battles and the setting, but like WHFB (Warhammer Fantasy Battles) as it WAS before Age of Sigmar (very controversial and something I'm still not in love with).If you can stomach the DLC list, you have access to multitudes of characters that shone in the spotlight before 40K became the big money maker, characters that still aren't in Age of Sigmar or radically different to the point many feel unfitting. That's the next best part about this game, its incredibly diverse. You have access to factions that were never on the tabletop or lore only. Norsca as a whole was split up between various Chaos factions, Vampire Coast didn't exist, it was Dreadfleet and lore characters at best, Cathay never had anything beyond being this mysterious land with like one or two units in the Third Edition of all things.All 3 are playable as their own faction.There's characters you can play that didn't exist as of the time period (2522 IC), such as Boris Ursus who died and Repanse who died 500 years before. But with a little lore-wise handwave, they're back, and incredible to play. There's even characters who were lore only, no table top figure, who you can utilize as commander/Legendary Lord, such as Nakai of the Lizardmen, he was practically only in books and the Lizardmen rule books.These little flavors of Warhammer have me overjoyed to be fair, and sure many lords don't always land, such as Tretch Craventail who may as well just exist but CA added him because he had a mini and there wasn't much else who wasn't already getting planed to be added, but that's fun, not everything is going to be a Major W, some have to be Minor Ws.The battles are of course a huge highlight. I want to say every form of fighting in a Total War game has been sufficiently different from the others in the franchise. Between the ranged formations of Empire and Napoleon to the vast field battles of Shogun 2 that seem to recreate samurai movies, what Warhammer offers is just a lot of magic and various armies clashing, of course, this lacks in other Total War games, and I don't mean that in a snide way I mean that in a ""Theres a whole new layer of strategy added."" When I say various armies clashing too, think of the Skaven who are basically a ""Mad Science"" faction, vs Bretonnia, who is very much this Medieval era ""Legends of King Arthur"" faction and all the tech progress that comes with it. It comes down to strategy and tactics to beat an enemy that by all accounts trumps the Bretonnians because the Skaven just have guns.It goes without saying that of course in other total war games, the tech level was ""the same"", sans for maybe some drastic differences in some real world groups at the time.The best part of the game though is you don't need to know anything about Warhammer. You'll find out from in game stuff if anything. But you don't need to know anything at all you can go into this blind and learn your way from there. Sans the DLC list, this is a very accessible game for anyone.And for a nerd like me, this is an oasis in a franchise thats become Space Marines and Sigmarines, and that's where I believe a lot of love stems from, not just enjoyment of the Total War franchise.",one must imagin skarbrand happi begin back got reveal total war warhamm step new direct total war albeit one wasnt unusu sinc warhamm mod total war game warhamm frequent huge armi clash even whilst may individu unit still fit howev massiv riski move sinc departur histor total war gamesyet workedwhilst tww still rough way know lot time arcadey keep come back play attribut fact weak also strength arcadey also attribut fact practic current best warhamm rt game actual fantasi battl even old world fantasi battl set like whfb warhamm fantasi battl age sigmar controversi someth im still love withif stomach dlc list access multitud charact shone spotlight becam big money maker charact still arent age sigmar radic differ point mani feel unfit that next best part game incred divers access faction never tabletop lore norsca whole split variou chao faction vampir coast didnt exist dreadfleet lore charact best cathay never anyth beyond mysteri land like one two unit third edit thingsal playabl factionther charact play didnt exist time period ic bori ursu die repans die year littl lorewis handwav theyr back incred play there even charact lore tabl top figur util commanderlegendari lord nakai lizardmen practic book lizardmen rule booksthes littl flavor warhamm overjoy fair sure mani lord dont alway land tretch craventail may well exist ca ad mini wasnt much els wasnt alreadi get plane ad that fun everyth go major w minor wsthe battl cours huge highlight want say everi form fight total war game suffici differ other franchis rang format empir napoleon vast field battl shogun seem recreat samurai movi warhamm offer lot magic variou armi clash cours lack total war game dont mean snide way mean there whole new layer strategi ad say variou armi clash think skaven basic mad scienc faction vs bretonnia much mediev era legend king arthur faction tech progress come come strategi tactic beat enemi account trump bretonnian skaven gunsit goe without say cours total war game tech level san mayb drastic differ real world group timeth best part game though dont need know anyth warhamm youll find game stuff anyth dont need know anyth go blind learn way san dlc list access game anyoneand nerd like oasi franchis that becom space marin sigmarin that believ lot love stem enjoy total war franchis

"2022 I'm going to start with the cons:* Honestly, the Realms of Chaos campaign took the fun out of the game. I don't enjoy the race and demon rifts. I'd prefer other objectives, like the newer factions in TWW2 got. I never played that one's vortex race much either.* Everything seems bare bones and the things I was excited for pre-release ended up being boring and draining (Minor settlement sieges, chaos realms, and massive battles in those realms).* I'm extremely disappointed that CA and GW have something against including Araby, even though it was much requested by many people in WH2 and is still often requested. It has lore, characters, and land in the game, would sell like hotcakes, and has a different aesthetic from all the current races. And yet, they won't bring it to the game for some unknown reason.The pros:* I love Warhammer and Total War. This series is a match made in heaven and my most played game series ever.* I love the new factions here (Ogre Kingdoms were my most desired faction). I love Kislev, and like the idea of Cathay, even though they are pretty bare bones in roster. Every faction feels a unique from the others in campaign play and aesthetics.* It has potential. We got some new minor races and I hope we get more (Araby, Southern Realms, Ind, Khuresh, etc.)I don't recommend the game in its current state. Maybe try back in a year or so, after the large map is released and the factions are more fleshed out.",im go start con honestli realm chao campaign took fun game dont enjoy race demon rift id prefer object like newer faction got never play one vortex race much either everyth seem bare bone thing excit prereleas end bore drain minor settlement sieg chao realm massiv battl realm im extrem disappoint ca gw someth includ arabi even though much request mani peopl still often request lore charact land game would sell like hotcak differ aesthet current race yet wont bring game unknown reasonth pro love warhamm total war seri match made heaven play game seri ever love new faction ogr kingdom desir faction love kislev like idea cathay even though pretti bare bone roster everi faction feel uniqu other campaign play aesthet potenti got new minor race hope get arabi southern realm ind khuresh etci dont recommend game current state mayb tri back year larg map releas faction flesh

"2022 I haven't yet completed the game, but I'm posting a review now because people need to know.The game itself is great but has issues not related to gameplay which degrade the experience so much that I honestly can't recommend this in it's current state.This unlike earlier From Software games, uses EasyAntiCheat which has been causing issues for many players, including myself. More often than not, the EAC popup shows but after that the game window never shows up. The only somewhat reliable workaround is to delete the EasyAntiCheat folder from inside the game's files (and the game's compatdata directory if using Linux) and then verifying the game's local files. Steam will then re-download the correct EAC files and the game should be able to launch.Other users have been experiencing different problems with EAC, such as crashes, getting stuck at a white/black screen and ""inappropriate activity detected"" errors etc without any good reason.If you are able to get the game started, you're faced with the second major issue, performance.Afaik, this is an issue on the PC version only, but nevertheless a major issue which needs to be fixed.Even on high-end hardware, the game fails to maintain a steady 60fps, especially in open areas. Sometimes the framerate drops down to 20-30fps in the worst cases. Only in some closed areas a steady 60fps is possible currently.This game deserves a thumbs up, but I can't give it before these issues are solved...EDIT: Seems like my savefile just got deleted. When I started the game I was only presented with a ""NEW GAME"" option in the main menu. No ""CONTINUE"" or ""LOAD GAME"" option in sight. So apparently that's a thing too...EDIT 2: Most of the game's performance issues have been solved, but not all and EAC is still causing the same problems as before.",havent yet complet game im post review peopl need knowth game great issu relat gameplay degrad experi much honestli cant recommend current statethi unlik earlier softwar game use easyanticheat caus issu mani player includ often eac popup show game window never show somewhat reliabl workaround delet easyanticheat folder insid game file game compatdata directori use linux verifi game local file steam redownload correct eac file game abl launchoth user experienc differ problem eac crash get stuck whiteblack screen inappropri activ detect error etc without good reasonif abl get game start your face second major issu performanceafaik issu pc version nevertheless major issu need fixedeven highend hardwar game fail maintain steadi especi open area sometim framer drop worst case close area steadi possibl currentlythi game deserv thumb cant give issu solvededit seem like savefil got delet start game present new game option main menu continu load game option sight appar that thing tooedit game perform issu solv eac still caus problem

"Rise, Son of Guilliman After finishing the campaign I just had to write a review to get my thoughts down on paper, this review will contain no spoilers for the story, but will talk about themes, gameplay and performance. Together of course with an overall impression, to start things off. Space Marine 2 exceeded my expectations by a significant margin, this game is really, really fun to play. I've seen some other reviews talking about how the combat system is ""unforgiving"", but I can only say that I disagree. The fast paces melee / ranged blend is really satisfying once you figure out what works for you. I played the game on the second to highest difficulty for my first run so far, I had to adjust in the beginning but once I got over the hurdle, quite frankly I just saw myself improving and getting better at managing the fights. To an extent fights in this game feel reminiscent of those from DOOM, specifically Eternal. Every fight is a puzzle that you need to think creatively to solve together with staying on top of incoming attacks and positioning. Complaints about the AI are valid, but I didn't notice much in terms of them getting in the way of me having fun. Performance wise, I'm running on a fairly old rig, 1080 and an i7-4790k, and I got stable performance albeit not exceptional on the high preset. For me I am fine if a game runs at 30 as long as it is stable, and Space Marine 2 was, depending on level, either running at stable 30, stable 45, stable 60 or unstable 20-30. The 20-30 range being in some of the later where the game is really flexing it's muscle in terms of scale and the number of effects on screen. As for all the stuff with the Epic integration? Quite literally you accept the EULA and that's it. It has no other impact on your gameplay. I find complaints around this sort of stuff to be valid, if exaggerated. It is okay to be upset that this is ""forced"" upon you, but I do not think it warrants leaving a negative review for the game, personally. Story? This feels like it could've been a 40k novel. I say that with significant praise, compared to the first game the stakes are higher, the characters are better, and it just feels like a part of actual canon now. I am incredibly satisfied, and depending on how the game develops in the next few years, it might firmly take the spot for ""My personal favorite 40k game"", as it is now, however? Firmly top 3.Suffice to say, I strongly recommend this game, I will be diving into the multiplayer and co-op components in the next few days, and if there is anything to add or detract from this review, expect addenda :) If no addenda are found on this review, my stance holds firm.",rise son guilliman finish campaign write review get thought paper review contain spoiler stori talk theme gameplay perform togeth cours overal impress start thing space marin exceed expect signific margin game realli realli fun play ive seen review talk combat system unforgiv say disagre fast pace mele rang blend realli satisfi figur work play game second highest difficulti first run far adjust begin got hurdl quit frankli saw improv get better manag fight extent fight game feel reminisc doom specif etern everi fight puzzl need think creativ solv togeth stay top incom attack posit complaint ai valid didnt notic much term get way fun perform wise im run fairli old rig got stabl perform albeit except high preset fine game run long stabl space marin depend level either run stabl stabl stabl unstabl rang later game realli flex muscl term scale number effect screen stuff epic integr quit liter accept eula that impact gameplay find complaint around sort stuff valid exagger okay upset forc upon think warrant leav neg review game person stori feel like couldv novel say signific prais compar first game stake higher charact better feel like part actual canon incred satisfi depend game develop next year might firmli take spot person favorit game howev firmli top say strongli recommend game dive multiplay coop compon next day anyth add detract review expect addenda addenda found review stanc hold firm

"I've only ever dipped my toes in the Warhammer universe, mostly through my friends hobbies and other games based in the universe such as darktide or inquisitor martyr. Despite having little knowledge I thoroughly enjoyed the campaign and felt invested in Titus's story, the gameplay is fairly solid but nothing revolutionary and the game in it's current state is a good base with some content but more importantly it has great potential to be built on.

2023 Slightly bigger map and a few more factions that have to be bought. Advertised new factions but they don't come with the game when you buy it.,slightli bigger map faction bought advertis new faction dont come game buy
"2022 I only played through about half the campaigns but here's a small list of what I noticed1.) I can run units through other units with almost no resistance, this means there's effectively there is no front line.2.) Ogres can't be knocked over, it's weird watching one tank a cannon shot in the face and immediately shoot back.Cathy have a unique stance. This drastically reduces unit performance so a major mechanic of the faction makes them worse if you decide to use it.3.) ranged units have targeting issues. They will, seemingly without reason, be unable to fire at targets that are within plain view of them4.) ranged units will sometimes decide to melee charge another unit instead when you order them to shoot them5.) large drops in performance once the portals open up on the campaign map.6.) certain quest battles will crash the game when you try them for the first time7.) Calvary charges usually annihilate unit formation with no real logic to it. The heavily armored cav charges will do less than they did in warhammer 2 to regular empire swordsman but a charge from light cav will send chaos knights units flying through the air for several seconds and completely scatter the formation? Something is clearly wrong with the way mass is being calculated.8.)spells are out of balance. I noticed spells that were ok from previous titles are wiping out units or destroying the formation now. (looking at you pendulum)9.) the cutscenes are all copy and paste. it's jarring watching the same cut scene for different faction leaders. 10.) the chaos invasion makes so that occasionally ill be fighting 6 or 7 armies at a single town in one turn and then I'll have to fight 3 or 4 more the next turn with the battered army. it's incredibly tedious.11.) dealing with corruption is a chore, there's 7 or 8 different types, it's ridiculous Wait to see if the modding community is able to fix these issues. if not then don't pay more than dlc price for the game because that's what it feels like.

"So far I love everything about this game. From the story, visuals, gameplay... it's a beautiful game about chinese mythology and a rare gem of 2024. The world and visuals are stunning, although exploration is linear I want to see everything this game has to offer. This is also the first game where I chose not to play in default english, as it sounds so much better in original voice (chinese) and it makes for a more unique experience.Combat is souls inspired, but difficulty is very forgiving. There is no block/parry button, you only have to dodge attacks at the right time. Also at dying you won't loose anything, but enemies will respawn on dying and resting. This game is not hard as souls-like so noob casuals like me can give this a try. However it can still be challenging and some bosses will make you die over and over again. You can't rush in and mash buttons expecting not to die in a few hits. With that said you may have to adapt your skill points, thankfully respec doesn't cost anything so you have all the freedom to try out different abilities/playstyle.To summarize, it's an amazing singleplayer game with all the right components- interesting story, great gameplay, amazing visuals and sound effects. Optimization is very good. I can play it on my old pc (i5-7500 and GTX 1060) with a bit of tweaking.

"The game is Warhammer 40K through and through. Grim, Dark and gritty.The story is good and introduces you to why Titus got turned into a Primaris well.For the obvious culture war question: No, it is not ""woke"".Combat is violent and satisfying. A similar experience to what I recently had with Batman Arkham Knight. It is challenging.(Countering, dodging and learning patterns etc, but it is more simplified here).When you play as Titus you FEEL like a Space Marine. The power of the melee attacks, ripping enemies limb from limb. The shaking footsteps where you can 'feel' the weight behind every step. The thunderous boom as so much armour, meat, bone and muscle hits the ground after jumping down a ledge.Started the game on hardest difficulty, and it is very challenging. Still determining if it will be possible to finish playing solo with bots. Edit: Seems possible, but is very challenging. Would only suggest ""Angel of death"" difficulty for the most dedicated players.Shooting is also satisfying, but can't be completely relied on, engaging in melee is nearly mandatory once swarms close in.Visuals are very impressive and faithfully 40K.Sounds are all great and when involved in fighting give you the feeling you are in a battle.Music is dark and 100% fits 40K theme. The main theme when the game starts actually sent chills down my back. (Awe inspiring).After a quick look, operations and Endless War mode will provide plenty of replay opportunity.Edit: Operations is thoroughly enjoyable. Levelling up is fun and very satisfying to become more powerful with more perks, better weapons and the armour skins are beautiful. The artists REALLY put effort into them!On technical and performance, the game is running beautifully. RTX 3060, I7-10700K, 32GB RAM, SSD, Windows 11. Ultra settings, native resolution @ 1080P with TAA gives 40-60 frames. Lowest frames I've experienced so far are 30 in graphically intensive portions. (Considering my hardware is not high end, the performance was surprising to me, it shows the game is well optimised in my opinion). The game practically oozes all the effort and work the developers put into the game and definitely worth any 40K fan's attention.Some are saying it has Epic. The game makes use of Epic online services. (Not an app, just core components that allow crossplay between Steam and Epic as well as the needed files for Easy Anti Cheat. No Epic account was required when I started the game and none created that I am aware of).A couple of technical issues I can't figure out, sometimes voice lines are normal, then barely audible (with subtitles it isn't too much of a problem, but if playing without them you strain to hear them.)The most glaring problem is that the so called anti-cheat is doing nothing to keep cheaters out from ruining the game for others. That alone is enough to spoil the entire experience in PVE and PVP.Couldn't join a friend in campaign and still looking for a solution. (Will update review if I find one or find the cause). Edit: I was able to join friends today with a few retry attempts, but connecting isn't reliable and sometimes doesn't work.Edit: No crashes or glitches thus far with exception that sometimes a save seems to glitch out and you restart a checkpoint with lower ammo, different primary than the one you chose along the mission, meds and health than you had when you reached the checkpoint. (This happened to me on ""Severance"" mission when activating generators with Ripper swarms, Gaunts, Zoanthropes and Warriors mobbing me.

2022 This game has made me punch my closet in anger so many times. Would highly recommend 10/10,game made punch closet anger mani time would highli recommend
"2022 (Just to lay down my bonafides, since every negative review here is instantly spammed with 'git gud' or some cringe 2011-type beat: I've 100%ed every Dark Souls game. I've done speedruns, challenge runs, the whole lot. When I call things in Elden Ring hard, it is NOT for lack of experience.)Elden Ring has a lot of minor flaws (sparse armor early game, some jank w/ teleporting field bosses, boring crafting, boring catacombs, the hundreds of spirits and flowers I will NEVER use), but I can basically forgive all of those, because the game (at the start) is honestly incredible.However... about halfway through, the development budget totally falls out, and every area is now a ten-mile corridor full of enemies that can 2-shot you *alone*. The placement feels almost random at times, and it gets tilting fast. There is an entire lategame subcontinent with *three* graces. That means, if you die to any of the 2-shotting wolves or patrolling archer hordes, you have to cross the entire thing again. The two areas after that are nearly as bad, to the point that sprinting through is the only viable option.Once again, I can totally forgive some bad levels! Every game has some... but the larger bosses feel like pulling teeth.Trying to beat every shardbearer (major boss), you'll find at least two that are literally unplayable. One early game that is easily cheesable, Starscourge Radahn, and one lategame that is entirely unforgiveable, Malenia, Blade of Miquella. The latter has an attack that is almost entirely undodgeable, with a half-second tell that only helps if you're 30 feet away, and takes me from 1500 to 0 in a second. After all the shardbearers, you get the semifinal boss, a damage sponge who can 1 or 2-shot with every attack, who has an entire phase where every attack is a room-filling AOE, and who then phases into a grab machine that will instakill you with its comical grab hitboxes and 12-attack combos.If you can beat the AOE/Grab-machine, you get the honor of fighting the final boss... which has a fun-if-unfairish first phase, followed up by a ridiculous final phase full of camera-breaking nonsense and a very childlike idea of ""Cool Final Boss"", which singlehandedly ruined my belief that the writers had ANY plan for this endgame. Like, we had a cool final boss in phase one with Radagon, but they got swapped for ~the idea of the elden ring~ like a ridiculous Soul of Cinder parody. Once the comical, humiliating damage sponge is taken care of, you get your pick of ending! There are effectively two, with one obviously bad third choice where you literally burn the entire world, because why not, and overall, we leave with very little idea what any of this was about, what our ending choice even means for the world, or what we've really done in the first place. Yay! Game done! After 90 hours, I feel totally numb and ambivalent to this!There are a lot more things to talk about, like how finnicky quests become with an open world, but ♥♥♥♥. I think the worst thing I can say is that I spent all of Elden Ring planning new runs and build ideas, and now that I've beaten it... I just feel tired... and let down. (But the OST does 100% slap, and I do love Torrent, as well as a lot of the NPCs. 100% A+ for them, you can hug a woman, which is more than I can say about my love life)---EDIT: There is actually precisely ONE thing from the comments I'd like to add to this review. If you see anyone saying Elden Ring has 'six' endings, let me break them down for you.There is the basic ending. There is the true-ish ending. There is a bad ending. Then, there are three more endings. These are all the basic ending with a color filter over the cutscene and a single word of dialogue changed. Nothing new is added, and they amount to: Become god, become god but bad (grey), become god but VERY bad (red), and become god but catholic. These feel like extremely late additions, and they only highlight how vapid the difference in non-apocalyptic endings really is. They're meaningless enough that Elden Ring *basically* only has three endings.Also, I only learned after writing this that the game features a field boss who is literally the first shardbearer! The dude from all the trailers just... shows up in the field with a different name, and you fight him again. Elden Ring's copypasting problem is seriously everpresent, and I've not touched on it as much as it deserves, especially considering how mandatory catacombs are to the game. It's fun for one run, but by the second playthrough, I'd really prefer if spirit tuning components were just distributed throughout the fun parts of the game.",lay bonafid sinc everi neg review instantli spam git gud cring beat ive everi dark soul game ive done speedrun challeng run whole lot call thing elden ring hard lack experienceelden ring lot minor flaw spars armor earli game jank w teleport field boss bore craft bore catacomb hundr spirit flower never use basic forgiv game start honestli incrediblehowev halfway develop budget total fall everi area tenmil corridor full enemi alon placement feel almost random time get tilt fast entir lategam subcontin three grace mean die wolv patrol archer hord cross entir thing two area nearli bad point sprint viabl optiononc total forgiv bad level everi game larger boss feel like pull teethtri beat everi shardbear major boss youll find least two liter unplay one earli game easili cheesabl starscourg radahn one lategam entir unforgiv malenia blade miquella latter attack almost entir undodg halfsecond tell help your feet away take second shardbear get semifin boss damag spong everi attack entir phase everi attack roomfil aoe phase grab machin instakil comic grab hitbox combosif beat aoegrabmachin get honor fight final boss funifunfairish first phase follow ridicul final phase full camerabreak nonsens childlik idea cool final boss singlehandedli ruin belief writer plan endgam like cool final boss phase one radagon got swap idea elden ring like ridicul soul cinder parodi comic humili damag spong taken care get pick end effect two one obvious bad third choic liter burn entir world overal leav littl idea end choic even mean world weve realli done first place yay game done hour feel total numb ambival thisther lot thing talk like finnicki quest becom open world think worst thing say spent elden ring plan new run build idea ive beaten feel tire let ost slap love torrent well lot npc hug woman say love lifeedit actual precis one thing comment id like add review see anyon say elden ring six end let break youther basic end trueish end bad end three end basic end color filter cutscen singl word dialogu chang noth new ad amount becom god becom god bad grey becom god bad red becom god cathol feel like extrem late addit highlight vapid differ nonapocalypt end realli theyr meaningless enough elden ring basic three endingsalso learn write game featur field boss liter first shardbear dude trailer show field differ name fight elden ring copypast problem serious everpres ive touch much deserv especi consid mandatori catacomb game fun one run second playthrough id realli prefer spirit tune compon distribut throughout fun part game

"Game is good, but has room for some extra polish or optimizations.The story is a good power trip where the content feels challenging but you have the tools to do it. Some of the gimmicks wear themselves thin, even more so as a solo or duo where you have to trust the bots to deal the main damage over yourself (such as ripper segments). Thankfully these segments are few and far between. PVP is also fun with 6v6 matches and is enjoyable even though the modes are pretty basic.My biggest complaint right now is the fact PVP map pool is only 3 maps. The road map indicates a new map in 2025 but that means 3+ months grinding on only the current small pool. This and the slow pace of unlocking gear in PVP, I can see being a point of burnout for people. Also PVP matches really need to shuffle teams as two three mans can queue snipe each other to doom stack a lobby. Just general flow around menuing for PVP is also kinda clunky between the amount of load screens and waiting. For instance you can't edit your loadout in match, you must finish your game, then load into your battle barge, go to the armory and wait for the robo boy to slowly come down all while a timer ticks for the next match. To the point why even bother loading into the barge when all of this could just be menus you can flip through post match. And on the point of load screens god they are a pain.

"2016 It's Counter-Strike, what do you expect?I probably don't have to tell you if you will like this game or not. The Counter-Strike franchise is pretty well known in the gaming industry. For those who have been living under a rock for the past 17 years, Counter-Strike is a round-based FPS with two teams trying to either: 1. kill the enemy team or 2. fulfil the objective.

"2023 Elden Ring is a delicious late afternoon wine and cracker platter under a sweltering sun, cooled by a spring breeze and relaxing backyard music. The wine, the good of Elden Ring, it is intoxicating, addicting, aromatic and fruity, yet aged to perfection. The cracker, the difficulty, it is hard, rough, gritty and perhaps a little tough to bite through. Heck, some of the crackers on this platter are so stiff and unpalatable it could be hardtack. But there is no such crunch in Elden Ring, and these crackers, that cannot be overcome by lathering on a thick layer of cream cheese. How much cheese you apply to your cracker is up to you, but what you'll come to learn is that there is no right way to enjoy this wine. We all have our own idea of how much cheese we like. Some enjoy so much cheese that the cracker becomes obscured, perhaps there might as well not be any. Some enjoy their crackers dry, to compliment the complex blend of the wine as was intended.In either case, you will find how you like your game and enjoy it.",elden ring delici late afternoon wine cracker platter swelter sun cool spring breez relax backyard music wine good elden ring intox addict aromat fruiti yet age perfect cracker difficulti hard rough gritti perhap littl tough bite heck cracker platter stiff unpalat could hardtack crunch elden ring cracker overcom lather thick layer cream chees much chees appli cracker youll come learn right way enjoy wine idea much chees like enjoy much chees cracker becom obscur perhap might well enjoy cracker dri compliment complex blend wine intendedin either case find like game enjoy
"Great Game in my opinion, solid base building, exploration and RPG Elements and the design aspect is fantastic, few minor graphical glitches here and there and a somewhat rocky launch but hey... what launches perfect?4Hrs in and having a blast, so far no major complaints bar lack of enemies (But this could be down to being in the Green zone) and as the game progresses im sure this will change with QOL updates etc.PRO's -1.

"2018 A solid game. Very good shooter mechanics, Very little support from valve. All valve cares about is ""D O T A 2"". Only if valve focused on it's anti-cheat. The community is pretty toxic in CSGO. I still remember getting kicked from the game for being ""noob"" when i was new at the game. And getting cheaters in opponent. This really leaves a bad taste to the mouth of new players and casual players, since they just wanna have a good game. Many people will say ""Go to ESEA or Faceit"" But 60% of the playerbase doesn't even know what they do. So it's not really a solution to cheaters. People like me just wanna get back from school/work and have a fun game or two with friends. Hackers just ruin the game. And the worst thing is, People don't even kick them. They ""wanna"" get boosted by hackers but don't understand that getting boosted will do them nothing good, let alone by a cheater since if the cheater gets banned (they get banned only 50% of the time) they will lose their boosted wins thus deranking. And cheaters, OMG where do I start, VALVE! Please F I X your broken game ! there are literally threads on the CSGO reddit spoonfeeding and showing how to fix certain things.

"2023 My biggest issues are:- Game feel left alone as a cash cow. It started as a succesor of Warhammer 2 which was a great game, and outside of having more content is a strict downgrade on many levels.- Game is not being fixed outside of DLC patches, and even new content comes with unpolished and buggy stuff, that then never gets addressed. And this bugs are major ones, like whole systems (which in warhammer 2 worked!) being unplayable for months.- Sieges are total garbage, even compared to warhammer 2, where they were the biggest issue of a game (and game big selling point was reworked sieges...).- But probably biggest one for me, campaign feeling got worse. AI is completely incompetent in doing anything (which is strange, because coding is based on a previous game which was way better), it runs from you, deplete miserable forces and hardly prove a challenge. It gives an awful experience, where in like 5-10 turns I can steamroll every campaign without any thought, autoresolving almost every battle.It can provide some fun, but you will get way more from just a warhammer 2, can't recommend it, and considering rumors around this game it can only get worse.",biggest issu game feel left alon cash cow start succesor warhamm great game outsid content strict downgrad mani level game fix outsid dlc patch even new content come unpolish buggi stuff never get address bug major one like whole system warhamm work unplay month sieg total garbag even compar warhamm biggest issu game game big sell point rework sieg probabl biggest one campaign feel got wors ai complet incompet anyth strang code base previou game way better run deplet miser forc hardli prove challeng give aw experi like turn steamrol everi campaign without thought autoresolv almost everi battleit provid fun get way warhamm cant recommend consid rumor around game get wors

"Depending on what you want from the game it's either for you or not.If you are looking for a game with the elements of a Mass Effect or maybe Rogue Trader in it's story then this ain't for you, it's a game for the people who want the old games from 2010 back, the action based third person shooter with blood and gore. People who enjoyed the first game or even GOW, you will have a blast with the different executions, the gunplay and the overall presentation of Space Marine 2.It feels really good to just sit down, join some friends and blast your way through a tyranid horde and watching your custom made Space Marine cutting a Warrior in halve.The campaign itself was for my taste long enough, it had it's amazing moments with certain twists and expecially the presentation of the battlefield, how the skybox looks and the complete level design is something from another world.You get sucked into the world of 40k in a blink of an eye, even the intro video was the sweetest eye candy I had this year but it doesn't just end there, it goes on with massive scaled battles taking place in the background and the ambiente just fits so well into this setting, so fluent and yet so sharp.The Operations are not exactly what I expected, I do love the different perspective on the levels with the view of the other teams and what they did, it gives another nice inside on how the war against the xenos is fought.But I would have loved a similiar kind of PVE gameplay like in Darktide, might just be me but it would suit the game more if they'd add something like that, not as repetitive like Darktide but inspired by it to say the least.The classes all feel unique in their own way with how they play and feel like.Customisation on the other hand is done right with the player having to play the game and not just buying in on it, I get that people like to get the easy way sometimes but honestly, that's the way I like it with Space Marine 2.Don't get me wrong, I really love the fan service of most Warhammer games and I believe this game will do just as good as a Halo Reach in terms of said Fan Service.The multiplayer although needs a lot of work, unfortunately there is no true customisation for the Chaos Marines which makes me quite sad, I'd love to have a full World Eater set with all the different parts of armour and insignias there are but we just have to wait for that.Balance so far is ok-ish if you know how to counter f.e. a heavy, you won't have a big of a problem dealing with them but classes like the Assault who are just a flying target with no really prowess to themself or the Vanguard who has no real chance on surviving a encounter with a tactical is something they need to work on.Especially the Vanguard would benefit from one armour slot more or maybe a better evasion during fights, I know it's a light class but having a sniper ripping you apart with his pistol because your hook is taking a bit to long to shoot you towards him is frustrating, might just be me but that's my opinion on it.The game shows great promise in becoming a true sucessor to the first part and as of now it is a really good, if not even the best Warhammer game out there at this very moment, maybe Darktide is a bit better but that's just me, I love both of the games.Space Marine 2 is a game which gives the players what they want, it's really refreshing to have a game like this combating modern gaming and showing us that there are still people out there who care about a franchise this big.There are some technical issues I don't like that much like latency and the game not closing right, or just randomly closing the lobby in PVE and refusing to start a mission even tho everybody is present in the ready zone but honestly, it's not even fully released yet and we all payed to get our hands earlier on the game so I think it's something you can excuse as of now.If the stability of the game will be improved or not is up to the Devs and I hope they will take their time with the new DLCs, they already did really good on WWZ but they can do even better with this one.Can't wait to see this game becoming GOTY.That's all from me, if there is anything you dislike or think I missed please just leave a comment on this review.Stay well everyone",depend want game

"2022 NOTE: This game needs a pretty beefy pc at least in its current state, maybe once they optimize it better it will not stutter for those that have a gpu bellow the 2000 series. Review:Besides some bad PC optimization, some stutters which seem to only occur at the worst possible moment, this game is what I would consider a beautiful byproduct had Zelda Breath of the Wild and Dark Souls 3 spent a night in an Inn while it was raining outside. It has both open world, and in this case not the empty EA/Ubisoft kind where exploring will actually reward you. I cant count the number of times I have been to some god forsaken corner of the map and I actually found some hidden loot there. Meanwhile, it also presents the players will challenges like the bosses are significantly harder than those in Dark Souls 3. I am as of right now only 20hrs in and the ending is nowhere in site, honestly I don't even want to see it. This game has been hands down the best game I have played in the last five years. Do note I am a MASSIVE Dark Souls fan boy so I may have some bias because of that. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who love DS and exploration game!",note game need pretti beefi pc least current state mayb optim better stutter gpu bellow seri reviewbesid bad pc optim stutter seem occur worst possibl moment game would consid beauti byproduct zelda breath wild dark soul spent night inn rain outsid open world case empti eaubisoft kind explor actual reward cant count number time god forsaken corner map actual found hidden loot meanwhil also present player challeng like boss significantli harder dark soul right end nowher site honestli dont even want see game hand best game play last five year note massiv dark soul fan boy may bia would definit recommend anyon love ds explor game

"2022 It pains me to write this given all the hype behind this long awaited capstone title. I will say fully upfront I preordered and that burden to bear is mine. All the marketing was nice and shiny and it appeared CA was hitting a lot of notes towards genuinely improving upon the last two games. Well, the game drops, the NDAs are lifted and it quickly became apparent to many that apart from the ICONIC Creative Assembly launch bugs, the main campaign was and is at the time of writing this review: not fun. If you played Warhammer II you're getting the vortex campaign but worse. More accurately, it's like playing the Tomb Kings campaign but every Book of Nagash you get makes the game artificially harder, gives you no rewards, you can only access said books with your Legendary Lord and the location in which you retrieve the books gives you crippling debuffs and forces your lord to sit in a capital effectively removing one of your armies from play from an indeterminate amount of time. All this with the game expecting you to complete the objectives at a breakneck pace against grossly anti-player biased cheating AI. Oh, and you're discouraged from expanding your territory more than perhaps any other Total War game.A patch is supposedly coming in a few weeks to address some of these issues but it will not mechanically make the game more enjoyable. Take the realm of Tzeentch as an example for this section. The minimum time a player can complete this realm is I think 5 turns. If the AI makes it into the realm before you, forget it the objective is just lost. The AI is hard coded to always complete this section in the absolute minimum amount of time (and sometimes even less than that. In one of my campaigns the enemy completed this section in only two turns (this goes back to the breakneck pace I mentioned above.)Sieges:Another sly trick of the marketing campaign I was convinced would have been improved, there are simply far too many issues with AI pathing, terrain, unit responsiveness, and the so called ""defenses"" you are provided in the form of towers. A good 40% of these towers I have built have erected right up against a piece of terrain, or a piece of the fortress wall. This means one side of the tower is completely useless while the other only has a sliver of an angle from which to fire. These problems are all interwoven as the cheating AI pays no supply cost to build towers and those towers build instantly. This is not the case for the player and makes any sort of tactical play by destroying key defensive structures totally bunk. Optimization/Bugs/Crashes:While I myself cannot speak to anything negative with regards to the optimization and performance on my machine. I did experience one crash at my end turn but other than that I have been running fine. I can even alt-tab without issue. What is odd is that rigs much beefier than mine seem to be disproportionately affected by this and is of course unacceptable. However, we still are plagued with the gate bug, cavalry charges not feeling powerful, Slaanesh chariots just not working correctly at all, and new ones that have been introduced in the Chaos maps. Units can disappear and get stuck under an invisible lava bridge in Khorne settlements and so on. A couple of snow maps have had some weird flickering issues and are so bright it can irritate your eyes.Multiplayer:Just wanted to add a small section here for what is a small section of the player base. I enjoyed occasionally hopping into some quick battles back in Warhammer II. For whatever reason Creative Assembly has decided to push, and I do mean, push, a new multiplayer domination game mode with a few RTT style capture points, resources, etc. I don't hate the mode but it was pushed to the point where a player could no longer use the quick search feature for land battles. You could only play in this new ranked game mode unless of course you set up private lobbies. Lobbies that were total broken the first week or two of the game's release. Good luck finding a match when any tweaks to your search filters caused the lobbies to dissappear. Going forward there absolutely needs to be a quick match feature for both domination AND land battles. I want to enjoy the multiplayer from time to time but Creative Assembly has stripped away more choice from the player then haughtily assured them this is what they want.Closing:There is a lot here that would make Total War: Warhammer 3 a good game. There are genuinely good quality of life changes to diplomacy, the new factions are fun and all have a different play style to them. The sensation you get when large armies are clashing with one another can still be achieved from time to time. The daemon prince customization has a lot of potential for future content but in his current state he is too weak. I have no idea what they were thinking recommending it as a first campaign (other than to show off the mechanics of it) because you have way too many enemies to deal with. I'm saying this as someone with `1600 hours in Warhammer II and not as someone who is playing their first Total War title. The prologue campaign is not only an excellent tutorial for completely new players but it also proves Creative Assembly can competently make a gripping, narrative Total War campaign. I do take issue with everything in the UI just being a shade of red while at the same time getting rid of a lot of the flavorful art that gave the menus some life. They just went for a very rigid, efficient approach and I can't fault them for that. It's just too red. The new traits for defeating lords are totally lackluster. Auto resolve is just a craps shoot. Unit mass has been ruined entirely. This is at its core an open beta you are expected to pay $60 for and I think even suggesting it's a Warhammer II expansion is a little too generous. Creative Assembly had the makings for one of the best releases this year right there in their laps and in their arrogance they shelled out all these keys for these influencers so called only to ignore all feedback and criticism prior to launch. I won't even touch the debacle in China or the need to maintain a T rating to reach a broader market. We can have the land of the blood good, rivers of blood, fountains of blood, blood daemons, everything but the combatants are allowed to bleed. And don't get me started on the titty daemons. Now that the players have fallen off dramatically we are finally getting a patch roughly a month and a half after launch. A patch that will fix and or add things that should have been in day one. Thus is the state of modern gaming. I preordered this game while cynically knowing in the back of my mind some of what I was getting in to. Are you brand new to the series? Do not get this game at all lest Creative Assembly somehow step down from their pedestal and offer Immortal Empires to everyone who owns game 3 regardless of the other two. Be warned now that the complete Total War: Warhammer experience will run you over $250 (although sales are prevalent) not counting the future DLC planned for this game (assuming they're still willing to give this the TLC it needs and not ax it like Three Kingdoms when the going got tough.) Fan of the Warhammer series and own the other two titles? Your best bet is waiting for Immortal Empires which could be...June? A lot needs to happen in the meantime.

"Honestly the game is rather disappointing - seeing people praise it so much makes me worried the devs will get complacent with what little has been given out.You might see most reviews and think 'Oh, they're just upset there are server issues, the game will definitely be fine on launch!' and you would be right in that regard, but that isn't the main issue.Some good things first: 1. Looks beautiful. Probably has never been a better time to turn tyranids and traitors into mist (or dust also in the latter's case).2. Story is short and sweet. It won't change your life, but it is a fun experience.3. Customisation is solid.Now my main complaints:1. Crazy lack of unit variety. With a species like the tyranids you would think such a diversity of monsters are trying to kill you, but no, 60% of the time it is hormagaunts, 20% termagants, 15% tyranid warriors, and 5% everything else, of which stronger enemies such as the carnifex or neurothrope do not appear asides from very specific mission encounters. Hell, you even have gargoyles attack environmental things in the story and you have to stop them, but they never attack you??For chaos it is little better. 30% some weak chaos cultists who can be killed by sprinting through them(lol), 30% tzaangors(small bird demons with swords and shields), 30% chaos space marines, and 10% a terminator or lesser sorcerer.These issues are made worse with the secondary issue.2. A lack of operations. As it stands there are six operations to enjoy the classes and customisation with. It frankly gets old, very very very quickly. This is mostly due to these operations being story related missions, as opposed to something like Helldivers where you go to an invaded planet with randomly generated environments with side objectives; you are in effect replaying story missions. This is also worse if you have a preference for faction fighting - there are in effect three and a half tyranid operations, and two and a half chaos operations.Putting these two things together and the game feels like to me there is nothing more to do. The roadmap has not got me feeling too optimistic. This year we will get a 'new enemy', and next year (based off of wording) two more? There won't even be a horde mode until late next year. There will be a few more missions before the end of the this year, and one next year???? Killing the same three things per faction 90% of the time is insanely boring, even if the tyranid warriors and chaos space marines have some slight variation, it is far too similar to not feel you are fighting the same thing; the basic formula you will encounter is you are dealing with 25 hormagaunts stabbing you, 5 termagants shooting at you and one tyranid warrior shooting or stabbing you and that is basically it for your tyranid experience for however long you want to play this game.Smaller issues to just throw out. You do not feel like a space marine - you are constantly taking a crap load of damage, you are slow and sluggish. Higher difficulties make melee classes (of which three almost strictly are, and one in the middle) feel awful. Executions feel like they get old quickly, you feel like they are something you do to desperately get armour back and buy you a few seconds rather than look cool. Doesn't feel like you are fighting a horde - they give you this image as three space marines making a last stand against 1000 tyranids, yeah, no, hardly. Maybe 75 tops at once divided by three people; the other 925 are waiting for you to kill the other ones before all taking fair turns. Guns are not accurate, especially hip-fire, as if these space marines of all people have such atrocious aim. I'm sorry, but for the wait and the hype this is shockingly lacking. I really thought this would be the new addiction for a few months, but it really won't be. I remember everyone said this will kill Helldivers, and it might just do so, but honestly Helldivers very sadly blows this out of the water as it currently stands and that is the opposite of what I was hoping for. I really hope they try to make this better, but I reckon there will be little done to add content with the glazing this game is seeing.This game is for you if you are painfully starved of 40K content(please play Rogue Trader, DOW, or Darktide instead), are someone who does not care this game will be a very short ride, or is someone who is often too busy to play enough where the little amount of content will not be felt more greatly.I know it is getting a lot of positive attention, I bought into the hype myself, but it is frankly not even remotely worth it in this state; I would have been happy to wait another year than get this half-baked experience.",honestli game rather disappoint see peopl prais much make worri dev get complac littl given outyou might see review think oh theyr upset server issu game definit fine launch would right regard isnt main issuesom good thing first look beauti probabl never better time turn tyranid traitor mist dust also latter stori short sweet wont chang life fun customis solidnow main crazi lack unit varieti speci like tyranid would think divers monster tri kill time hormagaunt termag tyranid warrior everyth els stronger enemi carnifex neurothrop appear asid specif mission encount hell even gargoyl attack environment thing stori stop never attack youfor chao littl better weak chao cultist kill sprint themlol tzaangorssmal bird demon sword shield chao space marin termin lesser sorcererthes issu made wors secondari lack oper stand six oper enjoy class customis frankli get old quickli mostli due oper stori relat mission oppos someth like helldiv go invad planet randomli gener environ side object effect replay stori mission also wors prefer faction fight effect three half tyranid oper two half chao operationsput two thing togeth game feel like noth roadmap got feel optimist year get new enemi next year base word two wont even hord mode late next year mission end year one next year kill three thing per faction time insan bore even tyranid warrior chao space marin slight variat far similar feel fight thing basic formula encount deal hormagaunt stab termag shoot one tyranid warrior shoot stab basic tyranid experi howev long want play gamesmal issu throw feel like space marin constantli take crap load damag slow sluggish higher difficulti make mele class three almost strictli one middl feel aw execut feel like get old quickli feel like someth desper get armour back buy second rather look cool doesnt feel like fight hord give imag three space marin make last stand tyranid yeah hardli mayb top divid three peopl wait kill one take fair turn gun accur especi hipfir space marin peopl atroci aim im sorri wait hype shockingli lack realli thought would new addict month realli wont rememb everyon said kill helldiv might honestli helldiv sadli blow water current stand opposit hope realli hope tri make better reckon littl done add content glaze game seeingthi game pain starv contentpleas play rogu trader dow darktid instead someon care game short ride someon often busi play enough littl amount content felt greatlyi know get lot posit attent bought hype frankli even remot worth state would happi wait anoth year get halfbak experi

2023 can't recommend to play cs on mm or any other offical server anymore. i played it regulary since 2014 with times off but the AC doesnt work in anyway as same as the ranking system. that alone just ruins the game for me. the last cheater was deteceted HALF A YEAR ago. since then i played over 250h and for the SAME matches i found 150+ linked accounts that are banned on faceit. so maybe faceit is more of a fun experience.. to make it worse if you decide to solo queue your mates will be 9/10 toxic russians or sus new accounts (even with high trust factor). so even if cs2 is more shinny and has many improvements compared to csgo if they dont fix the ac it wont be a good experience either. the fun part (i guess) is to spend all your money on cases and get nothing in return besides a crippling gambling addiction. tldr: if you want depression play solo queue mmedit: still the same problems like in csgo but the game is even worse,cant recommend play cs mm offic server anymor play regulari sinc time ac doesnt work anyway rank system alon ruin game last cheater detecet half year ago sinc play match found link account ban faceit mayb faceit fun experi make wors decid solo queue mate toxic russian su new account even high trust factor even shinni mani improv compar csgo dont fix ac wont good experi either fun part guess spend money case get noth return besid crippl gambl addict tldr want depress play solo queue mmedit still problem like csgo game even wors

"2022 At this moment in time I would really, really like to be able to recommend this game. I enjoy the game-play mechanics, especially some of the new ones added in this rendition, I adore the Warhammer universe and have loved every previous instalment of this series. However with the current performance issues of this title, I'm simply unable to do so.The Total war games are games I've grown up playing and have been playing for many, many years now, hell I've still got my original CD copies of Rome, Empire, Medieval II etc. and I believe they are among the greatest games to have been made. However, most of these when they launched would at the very least function to a playable standard on most PC's with a good range of function as was considered for the time. This however does not. The optimisation of this game is horrendous, I don't know if it's down to a poor engine that is dated, running with sub-par code, or possibly, most likely, Denuvo. I have tried all the fixes, tweaked all the settings, and cannot see it changing for a considerable time.If a time comes when they have fixed the performance, balanced out some of the game mechanics between the different factions, then I will change my review. But until that time I cannot recommend that you pick up this game, pick up the older games and play them to death, they are amazing. But this one definitely has missed the mark for at least my personal expectation.",moment time would realli realli like abl recommend game enjoy gameplay mechan especi new one ad rendit ador warhamm univers love everi previou instal seri howev current perform issu titl im simpli unabl soth total war game game ive grown play play mani mani year hell ive still got origin cd copi rome empir mediev ii etc believ among greatest game made howev launch would least function playabl standard pc good rang function consid time howev optimis game horrend dont know poor engin date run subpar code possibl like denuvo tri fix tweak set see chang consider timeif time come fix perform balanc game mechan differ faction chang review time recommend pick game pick older game play death amaz one definit miss mark least person expect

"2022 I am unhappy with Warhammer III. It pales in comparison to Warhammer II. I continue to play WH3 in hopes that it will continue to get massive AI changes. Immortal Empires campaign is one of the main reasons I play still, with all the new races, factions, and landmarks. But the AI feels completely outmatched by turn 30-40 even on Legendary. I don't need the AI to have massive cheats and bonuses, but the game needs to have the AI be able to confederate territories far more often. Also the diplomacy in Warhammer is one of the most under utilized. CA needs to seriously take a look at how other games are handling interaction in Grand Strategy Campaign Turn Based Games. Some factions have no economy whatsoever, and its not that, that makes it far more challenging, but just irritating. I don't want to play Khorne or Kislev and just get beat by another race cause they can actually afford military power and I cannot. Confederations feel harder than ever with no longer being able to buy your allies, like you could in WH2, and I am in no way saying that was immersive and fun. But at a certain point if I have 400 relations with an ally, and I am strength rank 1-3 it seems silly that a 2 province Dark Elf faction wouldn't confederate with me. Diplomacy as a whole is missing so many additional options. You can barely even vassalize in this game or perform certain diplomacy options, even though they are available, but almost always unobtainable, therefore redundant.There's a lot of battle changes the devs have made to WH3 from 2, some have been for the better - buffing melee infantry, buffing melee cavalry, magic can now ""target"" single targets so its not just an absolute waste of winds. However minor settlement battles can be a little irritable, thankfully they recently nerfed towers. But they removed walling minor settlements, which makes the entire defensive tab irrelevant. There's also a lot of building chains in general for multiple races that feel like they do almost nothing, or are far too niche to even bother having. The map is incomplete and still feels to small. This is the end game of the trilogy. And even though they greatly increased our map, its almost that we don't need to keep pushing the borders, but breaking up the lands that we already have. I don't need to walk 3 turns every time to get to a new town or city. There's so many areas in the Warhammer Lore, and we are missing and it feels like such an easy opportunity that is lost on us. The Druchii Northern Mountains, The Dwarven Chasms in the World's Edge Conglomeration (Karak Drazh, Karaz-a-Karak, Karak Eight Peaks (also wth happened to K8P, now it doesn't even remotely look like it should)), The Empire itself - I feel this is going to be greatly expanded in the new update, but Bretonnia, Norscan Peninsula, Kislev, The Southern Realms, Lustria, Araby, have so much more room for development and map changes and it could make little towns feel like a whole new faction. Eveything feels far too condensed. Warhammer II always felt at the right pace, and the AI could actually form an Enemy/Rival Empire and be an actual global threat, now there's just a bunch of squabbling major races that can't manage their territories. Also 'Recruit Defeated Legendary Lords' should be apart of the game, its silly that it still hasn't happened. It would allow races to actually begin to steamroll, which you need because there's such a lack of any endgame big bad, not even the Ultimate Crisis Mode on max can really kill you unless it's super early. I feel this game has the potential to be great however right now I find myself disinterested and salty over a truly failed DLC launch with SOC. $25 for a half-assed DLC, and pushing back content release dates almost 3-6 months behind schedule now. If I see another $25 DLC and its even close to as less than the now fully released SOC, I will be leaving this review.

"2023 Я помню, как Valve объявила о начале beta-тестирования данного продукта. Тогда все хотели заполучить злополучную «каэску», увидеть и почувствовать на себе все изменения, которых не мало. Некоторые платили весьма кругленькие суммы, кто-то неделями сидел на Steam Gifts и все для того, чтобы получить игру, на которую возложено много надежд и множество ожиданий. Однако все это было уже после того как Valve сделала анкету, пройдя которую можно было получить игру, но мне было не понятно (да и сейчас тоже непонятно) по каким критериям выбирают бета-тестеров (сам я игру получил через 4 месяца после прохождения анкеты). И те, кто всё же получал CS:GO поначалу были очень довольны. Так же нельзя не упомянуть тот факт, что разрабатывали игру две компании: всем известная Valve и менее известная Hidden Path Entertainment.Valve и их новая Counter Strike: GO обещали порадовать всех: и фанатов CS: S, и тех, кто остался верен CS 1.6, и даже тех кто к «контре» так и не приобщился. Многих порадовало то, что в разработке принимала участие студия Barking Dog Studios, в своё время работавшая над CS 1.6.Безусловно, они заинтересовали тех, кто мало знаком (или незнаком вообще) с онлайн шутерами. Мнения остальных довольно контрастны. На мой взгляд, перед нами всё та же Counter Strike Source (как известно CS:GO использует именно движок Source, точнее последнюю его версию) только с измененной графикой, измененным видом меню и с чутка подкрученной баллистикой. И весьма сложно назвать возрождением Counter Strike, поскольку в CS: GO проглядываются черты не только Counter Strike, но и черты Call of Duty (что было замечено еще в первом тейлере), даже музыка в игре сильно напоминает музыку из Modern Warfare 3.И говоря о первом трейлере можно упомянуть, что многим не понравилось, как выглядят некоторые оружия (особенно гранаты), но уже на данный момент некоторые модельки потерпели изменения в лучшую, по моему мнению, сторону.Но все же игра доставляет удовольствие, и не из-за графики или изменённых карт, которые действительно впечатляют, а именно из-за геймплея. Геймплей, в свою очередь, почти не подвергся каким-либо изменениям. Он остался динамичным и воистину «каэсовским» (эдакая смесь CS 1.6 и CS:S). Все также перед нами стоит выбор за кого играть: за террористов или за контр-террористов.В общем и целом можно сказать, что на данной стадии Counter Strike Global Offensive выглядит довольно прилично, конечно есть недочеты, но все же не стоит забывать, что перед нами только Beta версия и все еще может измениться.Можно так же отметить несколько плюсов: расширенный арсенал оружия, улучшенная детализация оружия, возможность при смерти играть за бота, на серверах для баланса добавляются боты. Огромным плюсом, на мой взгляд, стало то, что оружие теперь имеет вес, т.е. с ножом бегаешь быстрее чем с винтовкой. Так же появилась поддержка DirectX 11.Про минусы, я думаю, будет глупо писать, ибо это только beta версия и все еще может измениться.",valv beta steam gift valv csgo valv hidden path entertainmentvalv counter strike go cs cs bark dog studio cs counter strike sourc csgo sourc counter strike cs go counter strike call duti modern warfar cs css counter strike global offens beta directx beta

"2023 I have many hundreds of hours in TWW I & II, and love the series. TWW 3 launched in a buggy unplayable state and I assumed they would eventually patch it into a reasonable gaming experience. The game was so unplayable on release that they did a '2.0!' launch that content creators were all hyped about, so I reckoned that was when the game would be fixed enough to play. It wasn't. Now the game is up to version 4.0 and I just can't anymore. It's been less than two years since release and we're up to version FOUR POINT OH! The game still isn't in a great place and I'm now officially giving up hope it ever will be. Maybe when version 9.0 eventually drops the game will be what TWW I & II were, but I'm tapping out. It's just never been in a fun and playable state and I find the demons gross.

"This game came as a bit of a surprise, since the first instalment of the series was a moderately successful title that left fans wanting more. Now, 13 entire years later, we get a sequel that turbo boosts the concept of the original in every way imaginable.You still play as Titus, but now you have a squad that follows you in every mission, and the main enemy for the first half of the game are Tyranids.Said Tyranids have some of the best dynamic swarm movement I've ever seen in a videogame thanks to the dev's experience with similar mechanics on games like World War Z.They can break off into clusters, pile on top of walls and generally act like a real horde, not a pre-scripted bot puppet.Graphically, the game is truly impressive, perhaps one of the best I've ever seen. I never tire of looking at the vast, grandiose cities going down in flames as battles rage on in the distance, with swarms of aliens descending from the skies while battleships fire at them. The design of the marines and maps is also spot-on, Warhammer fans (myself included) will rejoice at the small details on every character and building model. Of course, such heavy graphical fidelity comes at the price of performance, and the game does need a beast of a PC to run: with an RTX4070 ti, I could only manage 60-90 FPS at 1440p with everything maxed, with dips below 60 in extremely messy scenes. Still, DLSS did its job (I'm sure that without it, performance would be even worse) and the game hasn't crashed in over 12 hours of play so far.Sound design is also good, with special mention going to the weapon effects: one can only describe them as...meaty.Now, to the main point: the gameplay is limited, but enjoyable. What I mean by this is that you won't get any complex plots, open maps and huge skill trees here: story mode is almost completely linear, point A to point B, kill enemies, cutscene, repeat. You have some loadout options, but overall it's really not worth playing more than once.However, it is very fun, and it doesn't overstay its welcome at an average duration of 8-10 hours (side missions excluded).The melee combat didn't click much for me personally, with an awkward parry system and combos that can be performed with only one button. The ranged, third-person shooting is very satisfying though.After you're done with the story, you have two main modes to discover: the side missions that are heavily coop-focused and have their own class and progression system, and the PvP multiplayer.Said missions are much more challenging than the main story and require you to use your combined abilities and weapons to succeed, while offering weapon leveling, special abilities, small skill trees and marine customization options.The PvP is serviceable, offering the usual modes ones would expect (capture point, team death match etc.) while including a modified version of the skill trees used in the other mode. It runs much better performance-wise (120 FPS) and it feels alright, not exactly an afterthought but certainly not the mode the devs have put the most work on. For example, they could have added extra features like vehicles, turrets, abilities unique to each faction or even the ability to control Tyranids ala Left 4 Dead to make it more exciting.Most of the criticism I can throw at this game is simply my wish for more of it: more missions, more weapons, more classes and definitely more factions. Happily, the devs have promised exactly that with the roadmap: we'll get further updates along the way, for free (with a paid cosmetic option) and a very likely expansion in the future, as the ending of the main story hints at more adventures.Given the commercial success of the title, I'm sure we'll get all of that and more.For the Emperor!",game came bit surpris sinc first instal seri moder success titl left fan want entir year later get sequel turbo boost concept origin everi way imaginabley still play titu squad follow everi mission main enemi first half game tyranidssaid tyranid best dynam swarm movement ive ever seen videogam thank dev experi similar mechan game like world war zthey break cluster pile top wall gener act like real hord prescript bot puppetgraph game truli impress perhap one best ive ever seen never tire look vast grandios citi go flame battl rage distanc swarm alien descend sky battleship fire design marin map also spoton warhamm fan includ rejoic small detail everi charact build model cours heavi graphic fidel come price perform game need beast pc run ti could manag fp everyth max dip extrem messi scene still dlss job im sure without perform would even wors game hasnt crash hour play farsound design also good special mention go weapon effect one describ asmeatynow main point gameplay limit enjoy mean wont get complex plot open map huge skill tree stori mode almost complet linear point point b kill enemi cutscen repeat loadout option overal realli worth play oncehowev fun doesnt overstay welcom averag durat hour side mission excludedth mele combat didnt click much person awkward parri system combo perform one button rang thirdperson shoot satisfi thoughaft your done stori two main mode discov side mission heavili coopfocus class progress system pvp multiplayersaid mission much challeng main stori requir use combin abil weapon succeed offer weapon level special abil small skill tree marin custom optionsth pvp servic offer usual mode one would expect captur point team death match etc includ modifi version skill tree use mode run much better performancewis fp feel alright exactli afterthought certainli mode dev put work exampl could ad extra featur like vehicl turret abil uniqu faction even abil control tyranid ala left dead make excitingmost critic throw game simpli wish mission weapon class definit faction happili dev promis exactli roadmap well get updat along way free paid cosmet option like expans futur end main stori hint adventuresgiven commerci success titl im sure well get morefor emperor
"Regrettably i am leaving a negative review pointing out the serious shortcomings of Space Marine 2 as a veteran Vermintide/Darktide player who loves 40k lore.- During the first launch of the game, Epic games online components are installed automatically without a prompt screen. I do not want it in my computer. You have to go through loops to uninstall it. There is a reason why i am using steam and steam only and i want the developers to respect it. - When compared with Darktide, Dawn of War series and especially Mechanicus, Space Marine 2 has the weakest music OST. Looks like it was not even at top ten of the priority list during development.- As a cheap attempt, the game is trying to draw more attention by Twitch drops.- Very terrible companion ai. One of the worst i have seen for years. They do not use their ranged weapons in most cases and run gret distances to melee an enemy regarless of the class. And they very rarely execute a stunned elite enemy who is only two feet away from them. Such a shame. - No FOV slider.- Holding buttons to activate the abilities, instead of hitting them, is a terrible design choice.- Throwing a frag grenade takes two seconds, activating cloak takes another 2.5 seconds. Character gets hit during uncancellable animations. Every movement and ability use feels unresponsive and stiff during the campaign and multiplayer. Runningg gets interrupted for no reason even if you are holding shift and not even hit by anything. - Uncancellable dodge, roll over and similar animations are the primary reason why i keep dying. Controls feel very unresponsive.- Boss fights are almost identical. Area attacks such as some form of 3 round mortar shots, melee charge attacks, ranged attacks and one big 3-wave either green or purple wide area attack which can hit even behind cover is the same rinse and repeat mechanic for both tyranid and chaos bosses. - Melee combat is terribly designed. Interruptions are common and costs the player half of his health points.- Ranged weapons feel weak. An elite enemy (Not a boss or a lecter) takes 30 to 40 bolter rounds to put down. Crossing bone swords makes the enemy immune to ranged damage even if you hit the legs, head or spray it from sides. - The enemies i have mentioned above are bullet sponges but a hit from them take out half of your hp. - Crowd control options are limited to grenades. I suggest developers to play Vermintide and Dark Tide to see how it is perfected during many years. - There is a hideous terrible jetpack mission. I hated it.- Multiple 'Loading resources - loading logic' screens. - Entire multiplayer lobby system has to be redesigned. It is bad.- You cannot inject your allies with the stimpack you have in your inventory. - PVP section of the game is the worst. Very unbalanced. Is this game not beta-tested?- Cheaters are out there already. I have already witnessed speedhacks and maphacks.- Easy Anticheat is known as how 'Easy' it is to bypass it. A bad choice from the developers.- The number of the co-op missions is very few. These missions in general feel rushed, unfinished and exteremely repetitive with very little variation. Even the spawn locations are more or less the same.- Unlocking armor pieces or better versions of the same weapon is very grindy. This is how the game targets longevity.- The game becomes boring and repetitive very quickly. I do not expect it to have a long lifespan. - I was unable to pickup some medkits, ammo boxes or grenades even i had the inventory slot available. Pickup prompt was not there.- Ranged enemies shoot with 120% accuracy and every shot lands perfectly. - There is a shield or armor mechanic which recharges a specific amount with combo kills. This mechanic is not working as intended and definitely not user friendly.Cnclusion: 6/10. Wait for a discount or buy the cheapest package if you must. After the hype is dead, the game will no longer be played by most of us. I believe that Space Marine 2 would be a great game if it was released 10 years ago.",regrett leav neg review point seriou shortcom space marin veteran vermintidedarktid player love lore first launch game epic game onlin compon instal automat without prompt screen want comput go loop uninstal reason use steam steam want develop respect compar darktid dawn war seri especi mechanicu space marin weakest music ost look like even top ten prioriti list develop cheap attempt game tri draw attent twitch drop terribl companion ai one worst seen year use rang weapon case run gret distanc mele enemi regarless class rare execut stun elit enemi two feet away shame fov slider hold button activ abil instead hit terribl design choic throw frag grenad take two second activ cloak take anoth second charact get hit uncancel anim everi movement abil use feel unrespons stiff campaign multiplay runningg get interrupt reason even hold shift even hit anyth uncancel dodg roll similar anim primari reason keep die control feel unrespons boss fight almost ident area attack form round mortar shot mele charg attack rang attack one big either green purpl wide area attack hit even behind cover rins repeat mechan tyranid chao boss mele combat terribl design interrupt common cost player half health point rang weapon feel weak elit enemi boss lecter take bolter round put cross bone sword make enemi immun rang damag even hit leg head spray side enemi mention bullet spong hit take half hp crowd control option limit grenad suggest develop play vermintid dark tide see perfect mani year hideou terribl jetpack mission hate multipl load resourc load logic screen entir multiplay lobbi system redesign bad inject alli stimpack inventori pvp section game worst unbalanc game betatest cheater alreadi alreadi wit speedhack maphack easi anticheat known easi bypass bad choic develop number coop mission mission gener feel rush unfinish exterem repetit littl variat even spawn locat less unlock armor piec better version weapon grindi game target longev game becom bore repetit quickli expect long lifespan unabl pickup medkit ammo box grenad even inventori slot avail pickup prompt rang enemi shoot accuraci everi shot land perfectli shield armor mechan recharg specif amount combo kill mechan work intend definit user friendlycnclus wait discount buy cheapest packag must hype dead game longer play us believ space marin would great game releas year ago
"This game has the big awesome set pieces and aesthetic from the old school God of War games, the core gameplay of a Soul-like (albeit a tad more forgiving), really sick and fast paced Sekiro / Bloodborne combat, and every cool Kung Fu thing you can think of ever all mixed into one.Only a short bit in but this may be my GOTY. It also looks fantastic and runs surprisingly well (7800x3d + 3080 ti, getting 70-90 fps with RT off and everything on Very High).Very strong recommend out the gate. I have to stop playing and go to bed but I want more badly.edit: Played it a bit more at lunch and still enjoying it. The first boss f-ed me up a few times but overall this is easier than a FromSoft game.

"2023 I love the game. I have enough time between Warhammer 1, 2 and 3 to have earned a PhD if I was a responsible adult. Instead, I enjoy watching Treemen slap the piss out of chaos warriors.It breaks my heart to say this, but I cannot recommend this game. Creative Assembly needs a custodian team to iron out all the bugs. As the Immortal Empires campaign continues to expand, the complexity and interaction with all the DLC is introducing bugs that are weighing down the game. This in itself is not a problem; the lack of a dedicated team to iron those bugs out and patch the game is.Dear CA: This is your baby. Give it the development resources it deserves. Let your child continue to grow.Updating review: DLC has slowed down, and CA seems to be putting more time into fixing the game.

All the hype, all the praise, all the positive buzz surrounding this game...they're absolutely deserved and this is hands down, one of THE best games of this generation, not just this year. The combat, fluidity of animations, the level and boss design, the intricate level and environmental design, all the different characters and enemies, they're all very unique, varied and superbly crafted. When you take control of the Monkey King (Sun Wukong) you really feel the power behind that staff and every swing you make against your enemies. I won't spoil the details but the gameplay mechanic is very rich and varied and rewarding. There's a whole level up system that can be used to power up your abilities and spells which can be used in subsequent battles.

"2023 Total war is my favorite strategy game series, paradox aside.I did not expect this game to have a great launch, based off of my perception of Rome 2, Britannia, Attila, 3 King launches.I bought this game right at 20% off within a month of launch solely for the 5-6 people multiplayer campaign which is a fantastic feature that I absolutely love, and have sunk loads of hours with my friends into it. Thou I imagine we are a minority that use this feature.That being said, my interest (and my friends) has stalled out. And I have not touched it since. (pretty sure my friends stopped playing too). My consensuses is similar to how I view Warhammer 1, Attila.The bugs, unrefined mechanics, and lackluster game play does not allow continuous fun from what the game has to offer. It is currently still a worse version of Warhammer 2.The only reason I currently return I for a occasional multiplayer campaignI expect CA to pour their souls into this game but until I no longer get the feeling that I rather play Warhammer 2, I won't recommend this game.I don't expect CA to change this thou, the Warhammer 3 ""realms of chaos"" campaign sucks (No joke, I'd rather play ""wraith of Sparta"" campaign)...If they update the (Warhammer 2 campaign) eye of the vortex, ill forgive them.Update: So it does seem like CA is putting effort into the game and I've been enjoying it . Made the immortal empires campaign free, redid a bad DLC, putting updates into the game, putting vitality into the base content, fixing bugs, yet somehow sieges, still just are awful (like at least revert to WH2).

"This is a FOMO game. (Fear of Missing Out).The game is great to play only once you can try it as it's free if you don't have something to play but don't invest in it.The mechanics of the game are made in a way, so you must always play every week and every day, you have to at least log in every day, check the base, sell stuff, and so on.I played the game for 208 hours and played the whole season and after this season I was expecting as promised by the developers of the game to start a new season with some of the materials/weapons/armor/deviations that I had gathered during my playthrough but this is NOT happening because you only have to spend a few points to transfer some of the items between seasons.Only a weapon costs so many points that you can't transfer anything else just a pair of pants together with my weapon and that's it, all the thousands of materials that I gathered after playing for 208 hours are useless as you can't bring them over.The current season is a replay from the previous one with no changes at all neither the map has changed neither new mechanics or new quests, and still you have to start again from level 2 with the pajamas that you started when you started first playing the game...Some bugs that were from the beta when I first played the game are still there not fixed and from what I believe they never are going to be fixed because they don't break the game just make it harder for you. For example, you gather polluted water to pass it through a purifier to make impure acid, while you are online it works perfectly when you are offline the same machine gives you purified water instead of impure acid this bug was from when the game was beta and it's still here.I do have a lot of things that I can keep going on but the message is clear, it's a free game play it as free don't invest time or money on it.They could keep the seasons longer so they can have to release new content and then make everyone reroll their characters but instead, they choose to make everyone start from level 2 in the same content.Personally, I can't recommend this game to anyone because it's a FOMO game and the way that the developers are working toward the players is actually to keep them with the same stuff that has already been made instead of making new content for it.",fomo game fear miss outth game great play tri free dont someth play dont invest itth mechan game made way must alway play everi week everi day least log everi day check base sell stuff oni play game hour play whole season season expect promis develop game start new season materialsweaponsarmordevi gather playthrough happen spend point transfer item seasonsonli weapon cost mani point cant transfer anyth els pair pant togeth weapon that thousand materi gather play hour useless cant bring overth current season replay previou one chang neither map chang neither new mechan new quest still start level pajama start start first play gamesom bug beta first play game still fix believ never go fix dont break game make harder exampl gather pollut water pass purifi make impur acid onlin work perfectli offlin machin give purifi water instead impur acid bug game beta still herei lot thing keep go messag clear free game play free dont invest time money itthey could keep season longer releas new content make everyon rerol charact instead choos make everyon start level contentperson cant recommend game anyon fomo game way develop work toward player actual keep stuff alreadi made instead make new content
"Before I decided to get the game, which I didn't buy it myself. A steam friend gave me this game as gift out of the blue, thanks to him much appreciated. To be frank, I was expecting this game to be your regular souls like with a Chinese theme and ok combat. Well, I was wrong. I was blown away by the game.For one, the introduction story and chapter cut scenes were all topnotch, as if the developers hired all the participants from short stories award winners to make them. Music gives me goose bumps, never had I listen to a sound track so culturally Chinese and yet so grand and epic. As an ethnic Chinese, I never played a game that is so authentically Chinese, whether it is the aesthetics, music. buildings and clothing of the characters. You really cannot compare games with the art designs for Wo Long with Wukong. Though both uses Chinese culture as their setting the game. Wo Long just looks a little too foreign/off to a Chinese to me. (Like Ninja turtles to Japanese) While the level design of the game is not too different from your regular linear ARPG. The combat is just too good. Despite using mainly a staff for the MC weapon, there are three stances the player can switch from. Each stance has their strength and weakness depending on the enemy you are fighting. It is encouraged to switch stance against different bosses, it will make the fight better. Then there are spells and Spirits aka yao guai to help customize your build based on your fighting style. Combat is great! But do take notes, while some bosses may be too easy to a souls veteran, there are many others, especially hidden secret bosses that will give souls like veteran a run for their money. Map for each chapter is surprisingly huge. Given Chapter one is shorter. Everything because really huge starting from Chapter two.This is a really great game. If this game doesn't get a game award. the game award is rigged for sure.",decid get game didnt buy steam friend gave game gift blue thank much appreci frank expect game regular soul like chines theme ok combat well wrong blown away gamefor one introduct stori chapter cut scene topnotch develop hire particip short stori award winner make music give goos bump never listen sound track cultur chines yet grand epic ethnic chines never play game authent chines whether aesthet music build cloth charact realli compar game art design wo long wukong though use chines cultur set game wo long look littl foreignoff chines like ninja turtl japanes level design game differ regular linear arpg combat good despit use mainli staff mc weapon three stanc player switch stanc strength weak depend enemi fight encourag switch stanc differ boss make fight better spell spirit aka yao guai help custom build base fight style combat great take note boss may easi soul veteran mani other especi hidden secret boss give soul like veteran run money map chapter surprisingli huge given chapter one shorter everyth realli huge start chapter twothi realli great game game doesnt get game award game award rig sure
"So I'm 20hrs into Black Myth: Wukong and what started as fun has degraded into throwing yourself at the same boss for hours on end or spending said hours farming the same area over and over to try to level up. In both scenarios its frustrating and dull. People keep comparing it to Elden Ring, but at least in Elden Ring you could screw off and do something else if you were stuck. The linear nature of the game forces you to ram your head against a wall until you or the wall break, not a fun grind.",im black myth wukong start fun degrad throw boss hour end spend said hour farm area tri level scenario frustrat dull peopl keep compar elden ring least elden ring could screw someth els stuck linear natur game forc ram head wall wall break fun grind

"2022 I recommend this game if and only if you are already a fan of FromSoft souls games. A lot of people come into this game thinking it's a GRRM version of Skyrim or Breath of the Wild. It is not. It's a Fromsoft game, which means: 1: Direction: There is very little to tell you where to go, and when to go there. This game has some direction (which is more than previous games due to the open world) BUT this direction is not a direct line you should necessarily take. The game is big and the direction on the map is your eventual destination not your immediate goal. Exploration is rewarded. 2: Story: There is very little in the way of exposition in Fromsoft games. Every item description, every scrap of dialog, the position of ruins on the map all tell the story for those who care to search. However the story of the world is not hand fed to you. 3: Difficulty: This isn't the easiest Fromsoft game and Fromsoft is known for “difficult games”. You will die a lot, and that’s okay. While there is no menu option for difficulty in game, Fromsoft games are known for having builds that can trivialize the game. If you want an easy mode find the weapons/spells that make the game easy. Right now free Kamehameha Wave is crazy good (look up SpiffingBrit on YouTube)Current major issue I am aware of:There is a bug that can cause significant frame drops regardless of the specs of your PC. This does not affect everyone. 2 of my roommates and I have Identical specs. 1 gets frame rate drops the other roommate and I do not. As far as I can tell there is no way to know if you will have the issue until you get the issue. Don't people who are upset about this. Not being able to play the game is a valid reason to be upset. In conclusion: If you have never played a Souls game, see if you can get one of the Dark Souls games on sale and try it first. If you already don't like Souls games don't bother buying it, you wont like it. I don't buy racing games because I don't like them and that is fine. It's okay if you don't like Fromsoft ARPGs, don't let anyone tell you differently.",recommend game alreadi fan fromsoft soul game lot peopl come game think grrm version skyrim breath wild fromsoft game mean direct littl tell go go game direct previou game due open world direct direct line necessarili take game big direct map eventu destin immedi goal explor reward stori littl way exposit fromsoft game everi item descript everi scrap dialog posit ruin map tell stori care search howev stori world hand fed difficulti isnt easiest fromsoft game fromsoft known difficult game die lot that okay menu option difficulti game fromsoft game known build trivial game want easi mode find weaponsspel make game easi right free kamehameha wave crazi good look spiffingbrit youtubecurr major issu awar ofther bug caus signific frame drop regardless spec pc affect everyon roommat ident spec get frame rate drop roommat far tell way know issu get issu dont peopl upset abl play game valid reason upset conclus never play soul game see get one dark soul game sale tri first alreadi dont like soul game dont bother buy wont like dont buy race game dont like fine okay dont like fromsoft arpg dont let anyon tell differ

"After 250 hours on August 2nd, 2024My only review change is a thumbs up because they're constantly trying to fix stuff. But how I review this game is:While the game is fun, they really make the easiest things the most difficult. --After putting in 124 hours. As of July 22, 2024Once Human has the potential to be a great game. It's currently plagued by numerous issues that need urgent attention.Bugs Galore After Patch: Initially, the game seemed promising, but post-patch, it's been riddled with bugs. These bugs range from minor inconveniences to game-breaking issues that severely impact the overall experience.Missing Housing and Territory Movement: The game has significant features missing, such as the ability to access housing or move territories. It's been a week since these issues surfaced, and there has been no communication or updates from the developers, leaving players in limbo.Lag Issues: The game suffers from persistent lag issues. Whether it's during peak times or off-peak hours, the performance is consistently hindered by lag, making the gameplay frustrating and often unplayable.Server Problems: The server is always full, yet it feels dead. This paradox is frustrating as there's either a lack of players or they're dispersed in a way that makes the game world feel empty. Additionally, fixing one server issue often leads to another, creating a never-ending cycle of problems.Tedious Reward System: The reward system is overly complicated, requiring multiple clicks to claim rewards. Navigating through four menus to claim a single reward, then repeating the process for others, is unnecessarily time-consuming and tedious.Lack of Clear Instructions: The game lacks clear descriptions and instructions for players, particularly for complex features like Prime Wars. Understanding that Prime Wars is cross-world or connected-worlds and not tied to one specific world within the server is crucial, yet this information is poorly conveyed.Poor Housing Mechanics: The housing mechanics, especially snapping, are horrid. Building roofs or house walls is a struggle as the snapping feature barely works as intended, making construction a frustrating task.Blueprint system requires some rework - where gold/legendary gear is only available to the Wish Machine. And the only currency is locked behind weekly tasks - with limited availabilityWhile the game is fun.

"评分：9.5/10首先声明，我手比较笨，接触类似的游戏也比较少，所以现在刚刚进入第二章。仅就目前的体验给予评价。优点：1、游戏性，作为传统动作RPG，游戏基本满足了我对类似游戏的期望——通过战斗积累经验以及相关资源，并以此提高自身能力从而挑战更高难度。技能看起来很多，或许会有不平衡的地方，但作为一款单机游戏，其影响不会太大。2、画面，非常优秀，没开光追和DLSS也能感受到整体画面的瑰丽，特别是以写实风格展现出的逼真的中国山水。开篇天庭的战斗场面里云雾缭绕的氛围也是十分出色。3、音乐，超出预期，无论是几次预告中所展现的音乐，还是第二章开篇之前没听过的秦腔，都展现了深厚的音乐创作能力——无论填词还是谱曲都满足了我对游戏内容的想象。可以说对一款不以音乐为卖点的游戏，实在是超出了我的预期。缺点：1、闪避判定似乎过于严苛了，又或者在进攻的过程中无法中断进攻进行闪避，这导致我感受到的游戏难度超出预期。总结：《黑神话：悟空》在游戏性没有特别出彩的情况下，实则在其他方面展现出了惊人的能力，着实将这款游戏变成了一部可以并且需要全方位欣赏的作品，整体品质令人惊叹。——————————————————————————Rating: 9.5/10First, I should clarify that I'm not very skilled with my hands, and I haven't played many games of this genre, so I've only just reached the second chapter. This review is based on my current experience.Pros:1. Gameplay: As a traditional action RPG, the game basically meets my expectations for this type of game—gaining experience and resources through combat to improve abilities and face more challenging difficulties. The skills seem plentiful, and while there may be some balance issues, since this is a single-player game, it shouldn't have too much of an impact.2. Graphics: Very impressive. Even without ray tracing and DLSS, the overall visual beauty is stunning, especially the realistic depiction of Chinese landscapes. The atmosphere in the opening battle in the Heavenly Court, with its swirling mists, is also exceptionally well done.3. Music: Exceeded my expectations. Whether it's the music showcased in the trailers or the Qin opera in the opening of the second chapter that I hadn't heard before, the music demonstrates strong compositional skills—both the lyrics and the score align with my imagination of the game's content. For a game that doesn't primarily focus on music, it truly surpassed my expectations.Cons:Dodge Mechanism: The dodge timing seems overly strict, or perhaps it's the inability to interrupt an attack to dodge that makes the game feel more difficult than expected.Summary:While <<Black Myth: Wukong>> doesn't particularly stand out in gameplay, it excels in other areas, turning the game into a piece of art that can and should be appreciated from all angles. The overall quality is truly remarkable.",clarifi im skill hand havent play mani game genr ive reach second chapter review base current gameplay tradit action rpg game basic meet expect type gamegain experi resourc combat improv abil face challeng difficulti skill seem plenti may balanc issu sinc singleplay game shouldnt much graphic impress even without ray trace dlss overal visual beauti stun especi realist depict chines landscap atmospher open battl heavenli court swirl mist also except well music exceed expect whether music showcas trailer qin opera open second chapter hadnt heard music demonstr strong composit skillsboth lyric score align imagin game content game doesnt primarili focu music truli surpass expectationsconsdodg mechan dodg time seem overli strict perhap inabl interrupt attack dodg make game feel difficult expectedsummarywhil doesnt particularli stand gameplay excel area turn game piec art appreci angl overal qualiti truli remark

"Fun in the eyes of the Emperor! (Hopefully)황제폐하께서 보시기에도 재밌다! (그러셨으면 좋겠음)Didn't have this much fun with Warhammer 40K game since Dawn of War series. DOW 시리즈 이후로 이렇게 즐긴 워해머4만 게임은 처음인 거 같아요. Was a bit difficult until I figure out how to manage my health and armor, still hard as I'm working on switching between the weapons. 체력과 아머 관리를 어떻게 해야 하는지 감을 못잡았을 때도 어려웠고, 아직도 무기들 스위칭은 감을 모잡아서 어렵지만요. But even if I take those stresses into the account, it's still very fun game to play. 그래도 저런 스트레스 요소들을 감안해도 여전히 재밌네요. The downside is that it takes forever to load the game. 거슬리는 부분은 게임 로딩이 너무 오래 걸리는 부분이네요. If it's single player only, I can wait. 싱글게임이면 그냥 기다리면 되겠습니다만. But this eternal loading time also takes place in the multiplayer, which makes me LITERALLY into the eternal fight. 멀티플레이 때도 영원한 로딩이 걸리는데, 이거 때문에 문자 그대로 영원한 투쟁을 하게 되더군요. By the time my loading is done, a next round is about to begin that I can't get back to the Battle Barge, and I'm in the next round selecting my class. 로딩이 끝나면 다음판이 시작되서 배틀바지로 돌아가지도 못하고 다음 클래스 고르고 있네요. If there's a way to manage the eternal loading, I think this game is above the average game, and recommendation for Warhammer 40K fan. 영원한 로딩만 해결한다면, 평작 이상은 한다고 생각하고 워해머 4만 팬이라면 추천할만합니다.",fun eye emperor hope didnt much fun warhamm game sinc dawn war seri dow bit difficult figur manag health armor still hard im work switch weapon even take stress account still fun game play downsid take forev load game singl player wait etern load time also take place multiplay make liter etern fight time load done next round begin cant get back battl barg im next round select class there way manag etern load think game averag game recommend warhamm fan

They could have messed this up in several ways. Kudos to the devs.*Loads of contentCons:*Reuse of annoying enemies/bosses*Putting annoying bosses/enemies one after another Rant:e.g. Hey how about we put the player ina lake of blood and spawn an enemy that has frantic/weird as movement and the player can only fat roll in that lava and to boot let's stop him from summoning any spirit ashes/horses and hope that he dies of the bleed damage but ofc the player can roll into a rocky zone where he can move freely so yeah lets put that one on a cliff side where the player can roll into the abyss or just get pushed by the huge ass enemy. Oh and all for some dumb smithing stone he ll prolly wont ned anymore anyways.*So yeah some of the repeat enemies/areas just got skipped by me. It just made more sense to spend all your runes and grab whats there and die back to the grace(spawnpoint) which saved alot of time.Sometimes shorter is sweeter.

"The majority of negative reviews in a nutshell:1: I didn't coordinate with my friends on which server we were going to play on so I am now mad at the world that we cant play together and I have to start over on a new server and I lose my progress.2: The typical TOS misunderstanding that these cyber security expert wannabes flail around recklessly without actually understanding what the TOS means. TLDR, the game is backed by GDPR guidelines and if it was breaking them it wouldn't be sold in the US.3: Queue times for servers. The game just released, every new mmo/server hosted game has queues on release, get over it.My review:SO FAR, this game has delivered on every single aspect of survival/mmo/looter shooter that I have wanted in a game, albeit sometimes it can be a buggy experience, or it can lead to weird interactions with NPCs (really needs work). It has been an incredible experience and I will continue to support this game until it either puts P2W features in, or somehow the experience is sour after the wipe. Either way, I love this game so far and recommend it to anyone who likes the division, rust, palworld, scp, death stranding, or control, as it has small aspects of all of those games all jam packed into one awesome and intense package.

"2023 Decided to take the plunge despite bouncing off Dark Souls and the like and hearing how hard Elden Ring was. Well, don't let that put you off. It wasn't a cakewalk, but just doing everything in the game without grinding levelled me sufficiently that nothing caused me too much trouble. 140 hours I think I saw everything (no appetite for New Game+), I'm sure I never actually ""got good"", but I did at least learn a little patience instead of button mashing constantly.The game was very good, but I won't go so far as to say it's personal GOTY material, nor one of the best open world games I've played.

"2023 I really want to like this game as I liked Total War Warhammer 2, but in the current state it is simply not enjoyable. There are plenty of things that bother me like e.g. the excessive bloom on some textures, the way-to-strong depth of field and blur, the stutter and performance issues on some battlemaps and after end turns, and lackluster sieges (the list goes on and on). My main gripes are with the completely annoying, overly player-focussed, incompetent, and predictable AI and the enormous amount of bugs (among the most egregious are not-spawing-Ariel and the absence of Kroxigors for Nakai).Where Warhammer 2 was fun and polished, TWW3 is simply messy and non-functional. It breaks my heart to see the game that should be TWW2, but bigger and better, in such a miserable state.I suspect (hope) the devs are trying their best but probably as it is often the case upper management puts profits from new content over a functioning product. This is how we get a overprized 25$ DLC when the base game is in such an atrocious state.I didn't buy the Chaos Dwarfs and will continue to not buy anything from CA until they deliver an actually functioning product (which I paid for).

"2023 I've been a long-time Total War fan for over a decade, but the Warhammer trilogy is what truly got me invested in the franchise. I've bought every single DLC for TWWH series since the first game released in 2016. However, the latest price hike and CA's so-called justification for their decision have left nothing but sour taste in my mouth. I would understand the price hike if the DLC contained more content, or if CA was actually increasing pay for its employees, but neither is the case. They are evidently trying to recoup losses incurred by poor financial decision made by their executives. That burden should not fall on the fans. This game still CAN be something special - fans WILL buy contents for this game years to come if CA puts effort into them. But lack of bug fixes, consistent communication, and justifiable pricing will be the downfall of the community if they persist. To the average CA employee: I still support you and all the hard work you've put into the franchise. I hope the CA execs realize they're fumbling the golden egg they're sitting on.",ive longtim total war fan decad warhamm trilog truli got invest franchis ive bought everi singl dlc twwh seri sinc first game releas howev latest price hike ca socal justif decis left noth sour tast mouth would understand price hike dlc contain content ca actual increas pay employe neither case evid tri recoup loss incur poor financi decis made execut burden fall fan game still someth special fan buy content game year come ca put effort lack bug fix consist commun justifi price downfal commun persist averag ca employe still support hard work youv put franchis hope ca exec realiz theyr fumbl golden egg theyr sit

The Story is honestly really fun and probably the best part about the game currently. It has Co-op for 2 more players and is overall written well and feels good to play. Even playing alone is fun because the squad AI is surprisingly good.Combat feels really good if not a little clunky at times. You feel powerful in the campaign and in PvE on recommended difficulties. Combat in PvP is a mixed bag due to class counters and some imbalance. PvE classes are unique and very flexible in terms of skills and is very fun with friends and even randoms. Right now you can only play Loyalist PvE which is somewhat disappointing since they have the Chaos models and voice lines in PvP.PvP needs some serious balancing since right now it feels like you either get stomped or you do the stomping with no in between.Customization is fun as long as you are a loyalist Space Marine even though it could use a few more chapter emblems (please give me Son's of the Phoenix emblems I am begging you). Chaos needs its own major update for cosmetics because right now its just color swaps. Only major deal breaker is that the servers these guys use to host online games are the literally the worst. Ping right now will always be high no matter how good your WiFi is and its not rare to drop from a game. The Season Pass also does not work/isn't what you think it is. You don't seem to unlock anything right now besides one skin that isn't editable for the Heavy Class in PvE.Once everything is fixed with more content added: 9/10Right now Overall: 7/10 due to server issues for multiplayer PvE: 7/10 has major potential but needs better servers and more contentPvP: 8/10 if you either have friends or are really good otherwise its closer to a 6/10 due to imbalance Story alone: 9/10,stori honestli realli fun probabl best part game current coop player overal written well feel good play even play alon fun squad ai surprisingli goodcombat feel realli good littl clunki time feel power campaign pve recommend difficulti combat pvp mix bag due class counter imbal pve class uniqu flexibl term skill fun friend even random right play loyalist pve somewhat disappoint sinc chao model voic line pvppvp need seriou balanc sinc right feel like either get stomp stomp betweencustom fun long loyalist space marin even though could use chapter emblem pleas give son phoenix emblem beg chao need major updat cosmet right color swap major deal breaker server guy use host onlin game liter worst ping right alway high matter good wifi rare drop game season pass also workisnt think dont seem unlock anyth right besid one skin isnt edit heavi class pveonc everyth fix content ad overal due server issu multiplay pve major potenti need better server contentpvp either friend realli good otherwis closer due imbal stori alon
"This game is bad. It feels like it's gamedesign decisions are 10 to 15 years old.Let me explain why:1.There are two weapons. The first ranged one, and the second one. Also there is a melee weapon. But this doesnt count as a weapon you can switch to, unlike the ranged one. This results in some really bad keymapping that cant be fixed, because the logic behind what counts as a weapon and what doesnt is broken.You aim with the middle mousebutton, parry with c, melee with right click and shoot with leftclick. WTF?EVERY OTHER GAME has weapons you can switch to. Parry with rightcklick, attack with leftclick and aim with rightclick. Switch between melee and ranged weapons and this works well. But you cant in this game for some reason.2. Hold keys to interact instead pressing them. Why? I am not mentally disabled, the very few occasions you interact with something you literally cant f that up. Why waste my time for no reason?3.Unskipable intros. Watch stuff you dont care for 1 minute everytime you start the game. WHY DO YOU KEEP INSITING IN WASTING MY TIME?4.No FOV. Come on. In 2024? I cant see anything. There's a big spacemarine in 40% of my face and I have a fov that feels like 80° at best.5. Epic Store Services need to run in the backround. I never signed up for this.

"It's rare that a game lives up to the hype these days, but Black Myth WuKong does just that. It was promised as a visual spectacle with amazing combat and boss fights and it is certainly that. While I at times get frustrated and want to quit, like I did shortly before writing this, I also feel an immense satisfaction after beating a tough enemy. Game is pretty linear as well which I like, a lot of games are TOO open these days but this one is lazer focused on action scenes. Decent customisation, mechanics and some cool build possibilities, it's a genuinely great game. The ONLY big issue I have is the lack of difficulty slider and the lack of a mini map. Look it's 2024, if you wanna be a pro Elden Ring player that's cool, but some of us just want some cool fighting combat and to beat up enemies. Not everything needs to be a GIT GOOD style game. And for people who DO want that, they can continue to play on the higher difficulties. Other than that, having a lot of fun and even though I need a break for now because of those damn archers killing me, I will be back.",rare game live hype day black myth wukong promis visual spectacl amaz combat boss fight certainli time get frustrat want quit like shortli write also feel immens satisfact beat tough enemi game pretti linear well like lot game open day one lazer focus action scene decent customis mechan cool build possibl genuin great game big issu lack difficulti slider lack mini map look wan na pro elden ring player that cool us want cool fight combat beat enemi everyth need git good style game peopl want continu play higher difficulti lot fun even though need break damn archer kill back

"2023 I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, created my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",yo father probabl one oldest peopl play game singl father son son got game christma uncl instal comput start play end week hour game horribl alreadi hard find way spend time son alway friend watch youtub decid make steam account get game see could mayb play alongsid load game creat charact start play stuck suppos ask son help host game join love best time spent son sinc wife die game ever sinc brought son closer actual spend time togeth outsid hous togeth well game remind there fun everyth brought son mani happi memori

"缺点： BUG方面： 一、红孩儿Boss战二阶段，在所有浮空分身都砸下来后，红孩儿真身有几率会卡在半空不下来，导致战斗无法继续。二、有时候进入装备和物品栏界面会只出现空白背景，而无法正常显示现有的装备、物品。三、下筋斗云时，有一定概率不显示UI。四、和NPC石中人对话时，会拉到附近远程怪的仇恨，导致对话过程中一直被投射。 游戏设计方面： 一、 空气墙过多且很生硬。有些地方明明做出了“通路”，但实际不可通过。如果以树干或者石块堵路的柔性方式来暗示玩家此路不通，会让游戏体验更具沉浸性。二、 部分大体积Boss锁定点不合理，经常让玩家误判方向和距离，导致空大。 优点： 游戏设计方面： 一、 装备系统恰到好处，即不过度简单，也不过度复杂。每个装备的属性在对付特别Boss或者使用特别打法时都有妙用，并非一般游戏那样随着级别升高或者获取新装备后，旧的装备就会被丢弃或者雪藏。二、 技能在土地庙（传送点）处可以随时重置，能无代价更换新的打法，拓展游戏的可玩性，这点在多周目下尤其明显。三、 妖怪种类多种多样，而且每一类都有自己独特的外观和招式，并非简单的换皮怪。使得玩家在每一回跑图清怪都能有不同体验。 思想内涵方面： 一、 叙事。采用“罗生门”式碎片化叙事，这点如果读完在游戏内的影神图（角色背景故事集）会有更深的体会。二、 结局。个人认为无论“好”结局还是“坏”，一定程度上都超脱了一般游戏的爽文式结局，甚至具有一些哲理的开放性。这也是很多之前速通玩家对结局颇有怨怼的地方。 结论： 作为预购玩家，原本是抱着成与不成都支持一下国产第一款大作的态度。但目前游戏的成功可以说给了我一个大大的惊喜。虽然有bug，有团队经验不足导致地包括但不限于上述设计缺点，但瑕不掩瑜；作为一家新成立的小公司，游戏科学能做到如此地步，我觉得无法对这些瑕疵作过度苛刻的批评了。而在游戏发售后短时间内舆论场上风暴，本身也从话题度上证明了该游戏的成功。我无意介入这一阵阵风暴，作为一名玩家，我只想好好地待在平静的台风眼里，默默地玩游戏，时不时叹一声：“厉害！好玩！”这便够了。 CONS Bugs: I. In the second phase of the battle of Honghaier (Red Boy, one of Yaoguai kings), after all of clones crashing down, Honghaier may get stuck in the air and can’t land successfully. It directly results the battle being discontinued. There is no way to figure out except for reloading the battle.II. In some situations, equipment and item can’t be displayed normally, equipment and item tabs only show blank background.III. In some situations, UI may disappear after player dismounting Jindouyun (flying nimbus) .IV. One of nearby ranged monster always attacks you if interact with the NPC Shizhongren (Man-in-Stone, one of Characters) Game design: I. Invisible walls are overnumerous and unnatural. Some fake trails were just built for gorgeous background and not available for passing through. Please replace those ridiculous fake trails with rocks, trunks, fences or any environment matching things. These invisible walls is ruining our gameplay experience.II. Locking point of some bosses with huge body is illogical. It may mislead player and result ability or spells releasing on wrong position. PROS: Game design: I. Equipment system is on the perfection point, neither too simple and boring, nor too complicated and difficult. In common games, equipment item is more like ‘disposable item’, those equipment which gather previously will be destroy or just be stored on inventory. In contrast to that, each equipment with its special usage for the battle of special boss in this games. Meanwhile, different equipment/item combination will bring you different combat experience.II. Spark (Ability point) can be reset anytime in the nearest Tudimiao (Land Keeper’ shrine) at none of expense. It encourages players trying more methods to play this game, massively extends the gameplay, especially in second, third or even higher round.III. Category of yaoguai (monster) is varied. Every type of yaoguai with different model and action which can be easily distinguished from one to the other one. Designer didn’t put same mode on most of monster then paint them with different colour (nobody implies God of War hereby, doesn’t it?). It makes players always get fresh experience when they enter next chapter. Story I. The narration and text of this game belong to ‘rashomon-like’ style. Producers won’t tell players whole story directly. You need to gather NPC’s background information and carefully read them in Yingshentu (Portraits in journal tab) to find final truth behind endless lies, just like a detective chasing clues .II. About disputed ending, I personally consider whatever ‘good’ or ‘bad’ ending it is, the story won’t tell you what is it, it just enlightens you to think about what it should be. Philosophical karma, funny or serious? Can not judge it by a simple word. Conclusion: As a pre-purchase player, I have no idea of how good or bad for the first triple A video game which is base on Chinese classic folklore and ancient culture. I just throw money into slots and wait for uncertain result. Luckily, Game Science does an extreme nice job, bring me a huge surprise! Even with bugs and cons which I partly listed as above. Consider that how small their team size is, and moreover, Black myth: Wukong is their first triple A game, it’s unfair to blame them from head till toe. Don’t be a picky player all the time, be tolerant of these diligent game producers. After this game released, I noticed that some suspicious paparazzi posted their strange opinions everywhere. I think a pure game player should avoid those storms, stay away from publicity, grab a keyboard or controller then hit start button: Hell, it’s a game time!",bug bossuinpc boss boss bug con bug second phase battl honghaier red boy one yaoguai king clone crash honghaier may get stuck air cant land success directli result battl discontinu way figur except reload battleii situat equip item cant display normal equip item tab show blank backgroundiii situat ui may disappear player dismount jindouyun fli nimbu iv one nearbi rang monster alway attack interact npc shizhongren maninston one charact game design invis wall overnumer unnatur fake trail built gorgeou background avail pass pleas replac ridicul fake trail rock trunk fenc environ match thing invis wall ruin gameplay experienceii lock point boss huge bodi illog may mislead player result abil spell releas wrong posit pro game design equip system perfect point neither simpl bore complic difficult common game equip item like dispos item equip gather previous destroy store inventori contrast equip special usag battl special boss game meanwhil differ equipmentitem combin bring differ combat experienceii spark abil point reset anytim nearest tudimiao land keeper shrine none expens encourag player tri method play game massiv extend gameplay especi second third even higher roundiii categori yaoguai monster vari everi type yaoguai differ model action easili distinguish one one design didnt put mode monster paint differ colour nobodi impli god war herebi doesnt make player alway get fresh experi enter next chapter stori narrat text game belong rashomonlik style produc wont tell player whole stori directli need gather npc background inform care read yingshentu portrait journal tab find final truth behind endless lie like detect chase clue ii disput end person consid whatev good bad end stori wont tell enlighten think philosoph karma funni seriou judg simpl word conclus prepurchas player idea good bad first tripl video game base chines classic folklor ancient cultur throw money slot wait uncertain result luckili game scienc extrem nice job bring huge surpris even bug con partli list consid small team size moreov black myth wukong first tripl game unfair blame head till toe dont picki player time toler dilig game produc game releas notic suspici paparazzi post strang opinion everywher think pure game player avoid storm stay away public grab keyboard control hit start button hell game time

"Cons:Gameplay: Some perks be it class or weapon perks are overshadowed or useless Too much difference between the EXP rate of the lowest to the highest difficulty, which makes the leveling of single target weapons too tedious Kills give no exp and promote a ""just rush past them"" meta and mentality Enemies on higher difficulties have what feels like about 15% too much healthEngine: Bad Optimization No FoV slider The forced TAA is just uglyIncreasing the resolution on my 1080p screen to 4k via VSR and setting the FSR setting accordingly completely removes that issue but also removes at least 4 to at maximum 17 FPS, big oof.The best FPS + visual clarity balance setting is just the normal TAA or FSR at native max resolution of your screenOther: On launch the game automatically installs EOS, and asks you to agree to the EOS and EAC EULA, nothing of that is mentioned here on the store pagePros:Gameplay: Everything positive you've seen and heard is 100% true and feels even better when you actually do the fighting yourself. The classes even though they seem not that different actually have VERY different roles and become even more differentiated the further you progress in them. Really interesting progression system! The PvE and PvE progression is separate (Thank god)Engine: The Dynamic Resolution Scaling works quite good and enables lower end GPUs to play the game, albeit in blurry modeOther: You can uninstall EOS and EAC and play without it.

"This game scratches so many different itches for me. I get to command large armies of incredibly varied fantasy inspired rosters, most of the factions playstyles feel unique. I have been playing total war games for years and across all three warhammer total war games i have put probably 2-3 thousand hours of gametime in. The DLC can seem like theres too much to buy but you dont need any of it to enjoy the base game, and if you wait for a good sale you can grab most of them for around 50% off.

FOR THE EMPEROR!!!,emperor
"2023 Total War: Warhammer 3 is, for me, the most colossal failure of a sequel I have ever played. From the botched Launch to copious bugs, from poor design decisions to exorbitant pricing for new DLC, from poor optimization to scarce updates, I cannot justify recommending this. In lieu of broaching all of that, to offer a microcosm of the current state of the game, how about I post just the bugs that they acknowledge: • FPS drop on Cathay's Terrace farming/field maps. • Harald Hammerstorm can unlock ""Indomitable"" skill but is already Unbreakable. • When confederating Bretonnian factions, upkeep for questing Knights goes to 0 if Lord has Knights Vow. • Complications with Ariel spawning if you are beaten to rebirth by another Wood Elf faction. • Repanse is missing her unique mount model (Suleman). • Some of Harry the Hammer's abilities show placeholder text. • Snotling Pump Wagons do oversized damaged. • New Regiments of Renown units don't have unit caps. • Nakai can't recruit Kroxigors and other units. • Damsel's progression for vows is not advancing as intended. • Von Carstein Blade not being rewarded to caravans finishing at Castle Drakenhof. • Bloated corpses exploding randomly at the start of battles. • Free Company no longer appear to have their weapons in combat. • Crone Hellebron Death Night missions not triggering. • In Domination battles, units with both Frenzy and Unbreakable lose Frenzy when summoned as reinforcements. • Heroes can get stuck in an attacking army and cannot move. • When defending, Zharr-Naggrund wall towers are not controllable and do not fire. • Gatehouses on Zharr-Naggrund can be attacked, leading to units being crushed. • Ungrim’s ability “Journey’s End” not working. • Ranged battle AI is sometimes passive. • Thorek Ironbrow appears distorted in battle. • Units on Zhufbar map appear to be floating. • Soft lock when using the Hellforge tutorial. • Skinning issues with Centigor units. • “Support Religious Errantry” not working for Bretonnians. • Various technology tree oversights. • Champions of Chaos cannot upgrade Daemons using Warband Upgrades. • Throgg is not immune to Kislev Winter and Yvresse Mist attrition. • Teal visual effect on Glade Captain's bow disappears when she is firing. • AI moves just outside of player range. • Ambush battles do not properly start with army full of stalk units as AI cannot attack them. • Sometimes ranged units begin running into melee after running out of ammo with Guard mode on. • Iron Daemon & Dreadquake Mortar manual fire orders ignored despite UI showing orders present. • Event Message ""Army Receives Plague"" has placeholder text. • Sea encounters can cause the game to crash. • Some trait and tech tags are incorrect/do not work. • The UI scale can't be adjusted below 120% on 4K screens. • Units (particularly flying and cavalry) getting stuck, calling back a group. • Cathay Fire Rain Rocket crew continue fighting after being dismembered/beheaded. • AI controlled Vlad von Carstein is too tough in battle. • All Chaos Dwarfs factions show player's manufactory upgrades in the UI. • AI controlled Dark Elf factions build too many Black Arks. • Continued reports of anti-player bias in campaign AI targeting. • Line of sight issues over some unit types and certain map features. • Hellcannon projectiles alter course towards end of firing arc causing misses. • Valkia slam attack causes grey texture at point of impact. • Some Norsca Monster Hunts not working correctly. • Chaos Dwarf Lords with Great Taurus Mounts are susceptible to falling off walls. • Opening some UI panels causing performance issues. • Various siege and settlement battle issues (e.g weak Settlement Garrisons, weak walls and gates, ladder deployment, awkward pathfinding). • N'kari's charge animation seems to trigger too early. • Various missing sync kills. • Grimgor 'Enemy Killed in Battle' event message has incorrect faction name. • Various units unaffected by red line skills. • Some uncommon/common magic items showing better stats than rare items. • Incorrect model for Skink Oracle showing in Character details. • Blood splatter flickering on the ground (if Blood Pack enabled). • Cylostra is sometimes blocked from attacking an enemy settlement or army. • Wrong Ogre Kingdoms contract mission is sometimes given when selecting a specific contract. • Destroying a Tower on High Elf - Lothern will create a breach in the wall, leaving floating decals. • Whispers of T'zarkan could be more frequent. • Units spawning under the map. • Unique traits introduced in Warhammer III require balancing. • Ku'gath has a rough start in Immortal Empires. • Borrowed armies from factions will loyalty sometimes rebel. • Threaten may cause the game to crash in multiplayer campaigns. • Orion's faction ability can make it easy to generate free armies. • Visual issues with portraits. • Some unit models have excessively bright bloom. • Ambushing an army in forced march and letting them walk of the map causes the opposing army to die. • Autoresolve values seems overly favourable towards the player in Immortal Empires. • Inconsistencies in passive abilities or traits descriptions. • Some characters get more skill points than there are skills to invest them in. • Eyestrain & sickness. • Visual issues with trees spawning on maps. • Changed game settings are not saved, if player is leaving the game without properly closing it. • Chasing routing units is somewhat ineffective. • Cults are not impactful in campaign gameplay. • Corruption effects border textures visual issues. • Intended plague effects can easily get overwritten by other plagues. • Multiplayer desyncs when the AI's turn ends if one player is still going through the end turn cycle.That doesn't include bugs, like Ariel not being recruitable, that are listed as 'fixed' but still aren't and bugs that they haven't even acknowledged despite being in-game since Launch. The list becomes unmanageable when trying to compile all of them. There are 276 bugs that the Community Bug Fix Mod alone covers; there are hundreds more that aren't covered. Calling it unacceptable seems like an understatement.I waited 18 months to post a review to give them time to rechart the course of the game. While I will still hold out some hope for the series, primarily because I have enjoyed them so much in the past, and that it fills a niche with no real competitors, it is clear that Creative Assembly has underfunded and underdeveloped the game, exploited the good will they garnered after Total War: Warhammer II, and will continue to do so. If you want to continue supporting them, that is your prerogative, but I can no longer gloss over the myriad failures with the game and company.",total war warhamm coloss failur sequel ever play botch launch copiou bug poor design decis exorbit price new dlc poor optim scarc updat justifi recommend lieu broach offer microcosm current state game post bug acknowledg fp drop cathay terrac farmingfield map harald hammerstorm unlock indomit skill alreadi unbreak confeder bretonnian faction upkeep quest knight goe lord knight vow complic ariel spawn beaten rebirth anoth wood elf faction repans miss uniqu mount model suleman harri hammer abil show placehold text snotl pump wagon overs damag new regiment renown unit dont unit cap nakai cant recruit kroxigor unit damsel progress vow advanc intend von carstein blade reward caravan finish castl drakenhof bloat corps explod randomli start battl free compani longer appear weapon combat crone hellebron death night mission trigger domin battl unit frenzi unbreak lose frenzi summon reinforc hero get stuck attack armi move defend zharrnaggrund wall tower control fire gatehous zharrnaggrund attack lead unit crush ungrim abil journey end work rang battl ai sometim passiv thorek ironbrow appear distort battl unit zhufbar map appear float soft lock use hellforg tutori skin issu centigor unit support religi errantri work bretonnian variou technolog tree oversight champion chao upgrad daemon use warband upgrad throgg immun kislev winter yvress mist attrit teal visual effect glade captain bow disappear fire ai move outsid player rang ambush battl properli start armi full stalk unit ai attack sometim rang unit begin run mele run ammo guard mode iron daemon dreadquak mortar manual fire order ignor despit ui show order present event messag armi receiv plagu placehold text sea encount caus game crash trait tech tag incorrectdo work ui scale cant adjust screen unit particularli fli cavalri get stuck call back group cathay fire rain rocket crew continu fight dismemberedbehead ai control vlad von carstein tough battl chao dwarf faction show player manufactori upgrad ui ai control dark elf faction build mani black ark continu report antiplay bia campaign ai target line sight issu unit type certain map featur hellcannon projectil alter cours toward end fire arc caus miss valkia slam attack caus grey textur point impact norsca monster hunt work correctli chao dwarf lord great tauru mount suscept fall wall open ui panel caus perform issu variou sieg settlement battl issu eg weak settlement garrison weak wall gate ladder deploy awkward pathfind nkari charg anim seem trigger earli variou miss sync kill grimgor enemi kill battl event messag incorrect faction name variou unit unaffect red line skill uncommoncommon magic item show better stat rare item incorrect model skink oracl show charact detail blood splatter flicker ground blood pack enabl cylostra sometim block attack enemi settlement armi wrong ogr kingdom contract mission sometim given select specif contract destroy tower high elf lothern creat breach wall leav float decal whisper tzarkan could frequent unit spawn map uniqu trait introduc warhamm iii requir balanc kugath rough start immort empir borrow armi faction loyalti sometim rebel threaten may caus game crash multiplay campaign orion faction abil make easi gener free armi visual issu portrait unit model excess bright bloom ambush armi forc march let walk map caus oppos armi die autoresolv valu seem overli favour toward player immort empir inconsist passiv abil trait descript charact get skill point skill invest eyestrain sick visual issu tree spawn map chang game set save player leav game without properli close chase rout unit somewhat ineffect cult impact campaign gameplay corrupt effect border textur visual issu intend plagu effect easili get overwritten plagu multiplay desync ai turn end one player still go end turn cyclethat doesnt includ bug like ariel recruit list fix still arent bug havent even acknowledg despit ingam sinc launch list becom unmanag tri compil bug commun bug fix mod alon cover hundr arent cover call unaccept seem like understatementi wait month post review give time rechart cours game still hold hope seri primarili enjoy much past fill nich real competitor clear creativ assembl underfund underdevelop game exploit good garner total war warhamm ii continu want continu support prerog longer gloss myriad failur game compani

"As a fan of the 40k universe and Table top game since early 2000 this was Literally everything I had hoped it would be. The campaign was EPIC on the scale that you always imagined it would be like if you were a part of the action while shuffling you carefully painted and assembled minis around your home made terrain peices.I don't know how to adequately express that the authenticy and care taken to make this game really represent in a well played out narrative the immensity of the lore, scale of the structures, Massiveness of the armies and forces, the unique technologies and everything that makes 40k a masterwork of world building, really shines through even just playing through campaign. The battles feel intense, the sound design is amazing, graphically it is stunning from character and creature models to terrain, vehicles, architecture, and setpeices. I entirely get it there are some graphical glitches now and again and if i had a gamplay gripe it would be that the combat is a little clunky especially melee (but honestly the marines are pretty clunky....), although the Satisfying feel of firing the bolters and other weapons really covered for a lot. I'm sure as I continue to grind levels on Operations I'll be more upset about some of the technicals...but just purely as a 40K Space Marine fan I couldn't have enjoyed the campaign much more than I did. PvP is challenging and fun the Level grind Is going to be my next goal I'm not that big of a PvP player so I'm less concerned about it but it would be neat if that ended up being a strong feature too. Highly recommended in general, Must have if you love the 40K Universe. I'm sorry I'm not nitpicking like I'm sure there's plenty of reviews doing. But This is by FAR the best 40k Game I've played and I've played a LOT since Dawn of War 1 in 2004....Considering the number of patches games normally need before they have a mediocrely servicable product I feel like the Release of SM2 was above average in how well it performs technically on opening day (well 4 days before I got the early release version) compared to other new releases I have purchased, which I don't do often SpaceMarine 2 was an exception and I regret nothing.For the Emporer.

"This review only reflects the view of a SOLO player, if you intend to play with friends or pug the content then this doesn't apply to you. To anyone like myself who enjoys MMO-like games but plays almost completely solo I'd say give this a miss. At first it was enjoyable with most dungeons and bosses soloable (sometimes difficult but not impossible). However at endgame there is no difference whether you enter a dungeon solo or in a group, and with players finding the meme builds to make endgame challenges relatively easy the devs have done the only thing their tiny brains can do which is to simply increase the difficulty of all endgame dungeons and bosses to stupid levels. After the most recent updates endgame (Pro mode) dungeon enemies are just bullet sponges and the monolith bosses have stupid amounts of health with rediculous amounts of adds spawning continuously, not to mention timers not just as dps checks but for the whole fight. Two of these are a requirement to complete the story so far this season, which I can't do solo. Despite the jank I enjoyed so much about this game (looting, levelling, building, crops, weapon/armour builds) but the devs lack of innovation and imagination have created a wall I can't climb without playing with others which I won't do. I will keep an eye on the game and its updates, maybe drop in from time to time but I won't be investing any real time or money until they do something about endgame story content difficulties.",review reflect view solo player intend play friend pug content doesnt appli anyon like enjoy mmolik game play almost complet solo id say give miss first enjoy dungeon boss soloabl sometim difficult imposs howev endgam differ whether enter dungeon solo group player find meme build make endgam challeng rel easi dev done thing tini brain simpli increas difficulti endgam dungeon boss stupid level recent updat endgam pro mode dungeon enemi bullet spong monolith boss stupid amount health redicul amount add spawn continu mention timer dp check whole fight two requir complet stori far season cant solo despit jank enjoy much game loot level build crop weaponarmour build dev lack innov imagin creat wall cant climb without play other wont keep eye game updat mayb drop time time wont invest real time money someth endgam stori content difficulti

"2022 The best game I've ever played, a masterpiece in every aspect: Gameplay: it's challenging, but it gives all the elements to overcome these challenges and make you feel proud of yourself, it's in fact very fulfilling. There are many approaches you can take to progress in the game and the immense amount of content it offers makes for a lot of combinations with different outcomes that makes every one of them new and refreshing. Art style: it could be simply ""graphics"", but I consider it an ""art style"" because of how everything is put in the right place to give a beautiful view of the world from every place and at any given time. At any moment you can stop, look in a direction and see what it looks like a beautiful painting in front of you, it will be almost always different thanks to the day and night cycle and the weather changes. Story/Lore: it's pretty cryptic and obscure, difficult to understand at first because it's very intricate and the storytelling isn't direct, in fact you will get little information from NPCs or cutscenes, you will mostly need to read items descriptions, basically let the world itself speak to connect the pieces and some of them will be left out anyway, that's why there is a lot of lore and speculations. Game progress: the open world setting gives you a lot of freedom on how you can progress through the game, almost nothing is directly given to you beside general tips on where you should go and what you should do so it's up to you to understand it. This can be stressful as much as the gameplay itself but getting used to it makes you appreciate the sense of bewilderment it gives and encourages exploration because that's always important. Side quests progress: I have inserted this paragraph separately because you will eventually ed up finishing the game but you will probabily miss a lot of content because side quests have the same obscurity as everything else but they are missable, and some of them even too much and that's the only criticism I have about the game, it still encourages replayability because in order to understand and experience everything you will probably need to do different runs anyway. Variety: the world is massive and varied, it's divided in different regions and all of them have their unique atmosphere with fitting enemies, looks and stories. There are many dungeons, the major ones are all beautiful, the minor ones can feel repetitive after some point but I enjoyed them anyway because most of them have some sort gimmick that gives a bit of variety. There are a lot of enemies too, some of them can be encountered both as bosses and as regular enemies later in the game, it can feel repetitive too but they don't give the impression to be some sort of ""filler"" because it's all fitting and the game is so massive that it doesn't matter anyway. Finally, there are a ton of ingredients, items, equipments and dozens of types of weapons with different movesets and styles. Longevity/Replayability: even without the replayability part, the game is immense and it can take easily 100+ hours to finish without even experiencing everything, that's why it has a good replayability, you can start a new game+ by keeping the progress of the first run and experience the content you missed while still trying new things like different builds and approaches, there are also different endings that requires you to partake into different side quests.ConclusionsAs I said, this is the best game I've ever played and after almost 400 hours I still enjoy creating new characters and playing it in different ways, I even discover new dungeons and items after all this time!

"The game is a solid 10/10 for me, personally, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it 5 times and done all the achievements. There isn't anything in the game that I haven't enjoyed. Graphics, story, combat, the Chinese setting, everything clicked with me and I had real fun every singular minute spent in the game. The only thing the game could have improved is letting players enjoy all the equipment earlier in the game and the fact that there is no enough resources to upgrade everything you want in a single playthrough is a little bit frustrating. You get so many cool things so late in the game, you simply do not have enough time playing with them.

"2023 First of all this is what you get for threatening your community.I have started my adventure with TWWH2 and I have been in love with the series ever since and supported it by buying every DLC on release. The latest one simply looks boring and uninspired and on top of that CA threatens to pull support for the game if the DLC doesn't sell. If at least it was reasonably priced for what you deliver CA but this is simply not worth it.Go on then CA, kill this game, I wonder what your money maker is going to be, because it's definetly not going to be Pharoah.

"First time playing a game in this franchise but the universe is dark, beautiful, and deeply engrossing. Graphics are top notch and just fantastic.

Hoping they add more content (specifically operations) soon.",first time play game franchis univers dark beauti deepli engross graphic top notch fantast gameplay feel fairli smooth play sort like gear war god war babi downfal lack content full price game hope add content specif oper soon
"2022 This game is really fun, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the franchise or is curious. The reviews are mixed, and most of that issue seems to come from people saying their game is constantly stuttering and having issues. While I haven't noticed any issues of that sort, it is possible to lower your graphics in the settings and this would likely help with the issue. The game's pop in and strange shadows make me feel as if the game is lacking some slight polish, however I believe that it's not much of an issue at all and that this kind of stuff is to be expected from such a large game.I feel like the game, while fun and effective in keeping ones attention, may have issues in keeping players engrossed if they enjoy running off the beaten path, as many of the encounters are difficult to either encourage the player to come back later, or to nudge them in the right direction. In one situation I opened a chest that transported me into a poisonous swamp with seemingly no way out (fast travel is always an option so long as you aren't in danger, and I didn't realize this until after enduring large amounts of stress)Many of the enemies one will encounter are difficult of foot, and a horseback approach may help to easily defeat them, that being said make sure to use all of your materials to their potential, as crafting can be extremely helpful in taking down strong foes.

"2018 This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here.Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors....",extrem hardcor skillbas firstperson shooter forc think differ modern shooter your call duti player your go need chang play style succeed hereglob offens definit counterstrik sequel look feel familiar minor tweak help balanc old issu surpris longtim player demand skillbas multiplay game that satisfi ever specif kind player your will learn play differ your use look elsewher otherwis toptier tactic game probabl share longtail legaci predecessor
"An Epic journey that you will never forget.Disclaimer: I’m still making my way through the game, but after playing a few chapters, it’s clear that this game is something special.Premise: The game reminds me a lot of Sekiro, the environments, the absence of a traditional stats leveling system, and the way you increase your core attributes, mana, and health. It also brings to mind Nioh 2, with the ability to equip spirits and its fast-paced gameplay that blends combos and stances seamlessly.The storyline is captivating, brought to life with cartoonish cutscenes brimming with personality. It’s based on Journey to the West, and the game’s polish is evident throughout. The GUI is beautifully designed, sound effects hit just right, and the soundtrack is solid.You play as a pre-made character to stay true to the storyline from the ancient Chinese novel. Armor and weapons are obtained through crafting with resources and currency you collect along the way. Flasks can be customized with items that give you temporary advantages, like increased defense or healing over time. Mechanics and gameplay: Black Myth: Wukong doesn’t rely on traditional stats like endurance, strength, or agility. It offers a skill-based system. You unlock and enhance skills, switching between stances to explore different playstyles. Respeccing is quick and painless, letting you experiment without needing any annoying items, so you’re always in the action, ready to try something new.When you die, there’s no soul-dropping. Seriously, who actually enjoys that feature? I’m glad they left it out.However, the game does have some invisible map walls, and navigation can be a bit confusing at times and to me this is the biggest issue this game has so far.The game kicks off strong, with great enemy variety, stunning maps, and a slew of unique bosses. The difficulty feels fair, not cheap like in Elden Ring.You can equip trinkets, but you’ll stick with the same weapon, which you can modify and upgrade. There are no other weapons, but that doesn’t take away from the experience.Performance:You’ll need a high-end PC to run this game smoothly, especially if you crank up the settings. It could use some optimization, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Denuvo is causing performance issues.Sound and aesthetic: Voice acting is on point, and there are some interesting mechanics like transforming into an insect, bird, or fox, which adds a nice layer of variety. Verdict: Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a fantastic achievement. It’s got me excited to see what this studio does next. This game deserves its success, and I’m giving it a solid 9 out of 10.",epic journey never forgetdisclaim im still make way game play chapter clear game someth specialpremis game remind lot sekiro environ absenc tradit stat level system way increas core attribut mana health also bring mind nioh abil equip spirit fastpac gameplay blend combo stanc seamlesslyth storylin captiv brought life cartoonish cutscen brim person base journey west game polish evid throughout gui beauti design sound effect hit right soundtrack solidy play premad charact stay true storylin ancient chines novel armor weapon obtain craft resourc currenc collect along way flask custom item give temporari advantag like increas defens heal time mechan gameplay black myth wukong doesnt reli tradit stat like endur strength agil offer skillbas system unlock enhanc skill switch stanc explor differ playstyl respec quick painless let experi without need annoy item your alway action readi tri someth newwhen die there souldrop serious actual enjoy featur im glad left outhowev game invis map wall navig bit confus time biggest issu game farth game kick strong great enemi varieti stun map slew uniqu boss difficulti feel fair cheap like elden ringyou equip trinket youll stick weapon modifi upgrad weapon doesnt take away experienceperformanceyoul need highend pc run game smoothli especi crank set could use optim wouldnt surpris denuvo caus perform issuessound aesthet voic act point interest mechan like transform insect bird fox add nice layer varieti verdict overal black myth wukong fantast achiev got excit see studio next game deserv success im give solid

"2022 So I've owned this game for a while now, and at first I wasn't going to write a review for it. However, I have recently joined an awesome 1v1 community server that has been so kind to me, so I though I'd incorporate that experience into my review.When people think about the game, Counter Strike: the Global Offensive, they think about player experience. It is a strictly multiplayer game after all... People often refer to a certain toxicity in the general player base in CS, but I would like to shout out this 1v1 server. This server is a server that I have played on, and it is awesome. I have on multiple occasions, opened up about my familial past, and my son, Kurt (light of my life). It often gets shot down by haters or trolls or the like, but on this 1v1 server, I have received so much love... It has honestly been honestly so heart warming...It has gotten to the point where most of the familiar faces on the server renounce when I join the lobby, even asking how my son, Kurt, did in school the previous day. I have also disposed the fact that my wife and I have split up after 15 and a half years of happy marriage, and my friends on the server have been nothing but supportive of me. A typical session usually goes talking about my son, Kurt, the owl my backyard, or World War II documentaries, and it is such a loving time. One of my most recent feats in the server is making it generally a more healthy, kinder place. I have made it a point to say ""GG"" after every round, to the point that more ""evil"" players will shout obscenities, saying that you don't have to say ""GG"" after every round, but that never gets me down. Ever.Anyways, this is getting pretty lengthy, so I'd like to leave this on a high note. I want to shout out this 1v1 server, however I don't remember the name of it. If you do in fact find the certain one I am writing about now, please, reach out and say hello to me (and often my son, Kurt, will be in the same room as me, so you can say hi to him as well)! I have found a new love for the shooting genre of computer games, and I plan on sharing many, many more heart-felt moments with my friends and the ones I meet on the way.

"2023 With the ridiculous price hike like this I сould not recommend this game to any new players, CA somehow became worse than Paradox in terms of DLC pricing. For example in my country regional prices Shadows of change DLC costs only 5% less than Baldur's Gate 3. This new DLC lacks content even in comparison with WH2 DLCs, or the Chaos Dwarfs one, which in my opinion is also overpriced. Don't even get me started about lack of FLC content in WH3, we got only 2 half-assed LHs since more than a year from realise. And owerall state of the game is just awfull. Game has a tonn of bugs, line of of sight issue is still isn't fixed, some of factions, like Vampire Coast, literally unplayable because of it at the moment. They don't even know how their game works: maximum lvl of heroes is 50, but most of heros doesn't have 50 skills, even ones that were introduced in WH3, so you end up with notice that you have spare skill points, but you can't spent them. It is just few examples, there are a lot more other bugs, some of witch can ruin your campaign.I sure hope this new DLC will have at least half amount of content of BG3, will it, CA?

"I do like the story but that is pretty much itPVE is mixed. Most classes are fun some are busted and really make it hard to play other classes because you will think ""Damn vanguard sucks I could play tactical and offer so much more utility, and damage to my team by simply existing or I could play sniper and laser down anything that even dares to exist."" most of vanguard's perks work only when you are nearly dead and his boltguns are peashooters (Like every other bolter ingame)Starting with only six pve maps is a crazy choice in the modern age with so many different games that have much better pve options as opposed to space marine 2 especally with randomly generated maps. (they should exist within 40k considering how large the universe)Melee combat is done pretty poorly in this game larger enemies just stand there and do nothing when you hit them with your weapons they hardly move away from you or have any moves to break out of an attack chain leading to you just spamming one button until the mob does something else.The guns in this game are so underpowered but then you have stuff like the melta and las fusil and everything underpreforms inbetween those two when the idea should be that each weapon falls somewhere on the scale inbetween the horde clear and single target damage. so many bolters are just plain ♥♥♥♥ which again makes no senseThe enemies are so unfun to fight beacause they have no tactics accept rush and attack or shoot. if the tyranid warriors were weaker and more numerous and rushed you alongside the guants then maybe during the attack or right before it happens or near the tail end other tyranids (lictor, ravenor, nurothropes.) could show up and attack when you are least expecting it to really make it feel like a hivemind trying to force opening in your team's defenseThen the thousands sons could have more unortodox tactics relying on drawing space marines into Killzones with rocket launchers and snipers setup to eat you while the chaos spacemarines lock you up in melee and close-quarters combat Overall if you really wanna try it I would give it two hours and if you really dislike it get a refund. dont get me wrong this game can be fun if you just shut-off your brain",like stori pretti much itpv mix class fun bust realli make hard play class think damn vanguard suck could play tactic offer much util damag team simpli exist could play sniper laser anyth even dare exist vanguard perk work nearli dead boltgun peashoot like everi bolter ingamestart six pve map crazi choic modern age mani differ game much better pve option oppos space marin espec randomli gener map exist within consid larg universemele combat done pretti poorli game larger enemi stand noth hit weapon hardli move away move break attack chain lead spam one button mob someth elseth gun game underpow stuff like melta la fusil everyth underpreform inbetween two idea weapon fall somewher scale inbetween hord clear singl target damag mani bolter plain make senseth enemi unfun fight beacaus tactic accept rush attack shoot tyranid warrior weaker numer rush alongsid guant mayb attack right happen near tail end tyranid lictor ravenor nurothrop could show attack least expect realli make feel like hivemind tri forc open team defensethen thousand son could unortodox tactic reli draw space marin killzon rocket launcher sniper setup eat chao spacemarin lock mele closequart combat overal realli wan na tri would give two hour realli dislik get refund dont get wrong game fun shutoff brain

"Tl;dr, a game designed to take your money hidden by beautiful graphics.The Good: Once Human has very pretty graphics and an oustanding atmosphere I've been missing in a lot of games. The character creator with it's presets allow you lots of freedom - even with your body. Something I've missed in most games where it was either ""slim or slightly thicker"". The story is interesting and was almost compelling for me to continue. The cinematics and music are pretty to look at and listen to as well.The Bad: In the few hours I've played, I had many moments of ""oh that's like x/y game"". Usually a compliment, but not in this case - and not in an ""they took inspiration from x/y game and implemented it"" way but an ""let's change 2 things and straight copy/paste it"". As I said, the atmosphere is beautiful - but the otherworld (don't call me out on not knowing the names - it's a bit confusing tbf) could be a copy/paste of Control. So far I've felt awful Deja Vu for Prey, Death Stranding, NieR and Control, with heavy emphasis on Control and Death Stranding. Again, not in a good way.I've played a handful of survival games and this one has by far the worst HUD, menu and crafting system - because the game is designed to make money off of microtransactions (which shouldn't be called ""micro"" considering you have to spent 30€ for a skin). Makes sense, otherwise it wouldn't be free. But then, in my opinion, a survival openworld is the wrong genre to make money off of it. First look into the store I was greeted with a ton of timed events and things happening - many things you have to unlock by money first (should be noted that there's a season pass, which should be a crime in itself for a survival open world).Unimportant HUD things are too large and in the way while important HUD symbols like your thirst and hunger are at an odd place and too small. The crafting menu reminds me of Fortnite tbh. Also there's a crafting queue and timer on how long the thing you wanna craft is going to take. Even though a friend and I chose the same server and same world, we still landed in different ones. No biggie, the teleportation towers brought us together fast. The mc/player feels very... bad, so to say. We have absolutely no facial expressions and we move in a very clunky way (mouse sensitivity on highest setting and somehow it's STILL too slow - have to drag my mouse across the whole mousepad to do a 180). We have few dialogue options for the tutorial intro and I see what they've tried to do with choosing different questions the mc can ask and instead of giving the mc a voice, they let us do weird motions AS IF we were speaking - just that we are not and our face doesn't move an inch. They should have either opted for full voicing like in Mass Effect or none at all and go straight to the dialogue like in Baldur's Gate and similar games where you are presented with dialogue options.Conclusion:The interest in the story and the artstyle was almost enough to convince me to force myself through it. Others may find it entertaining to play - and I really do hope there are some people out there, because the game IS beautiful in what it's trying to be; but so many unimportant or even the wrong things were given too much attention. Sadly, Once Human will stay as a game I looked forward to for a long while, just to be punched in the face. I'll watch it from afar to how the story and progress will unfold itself because I can't force myself to continue. But in all seriousness, I can't recommend the game in a state like this even if it's free.",tldr game design take money hidden beauti graphicsth good human pretti graphic oustand atmospher ive miss lot game charact creator preset allow lot freedom even bodi someth ive miss game either slim slightli thicker stori interest almost compel continu cinemat music pretti look listen wellth bad hour ive play mani moment oh that like xy game usual compliment case took inspir xy game implement way let chang thing straight copypast said atmospher beauti otherworld dont call know name bit confus tbf could copypast control far ive felt aw deja vu prey death strand nier control heavi emphasi control death strand good wayiv play hand surviv game one far worst hud menu craft system game design make money microtransact shouldnt call micro consid spent skin make sens otherwis wouldnt free opinion surviv openworld wrong genr make money first look store greet ton time event thing happen mani thing unlock money first note there season pass crime surviv open worldunimport hud thing larg way import hud symbol like thirst hunger odd place small craft menu remind fortnit tbh also there craft queue timer long thing wan na craft go take even though friend chose server world still land differ one biggi teleport tower brought us togeth fast mcplayer feel bad say absolut facial express move clunki way mous sensit highest set somehow still slow drag mous across whole mousepad dialogu option tutori intro see theyv tri choos differ question mc ask instead give mc voic let us weird motion speak face doesnt move inch either opt full voic like mass effect none go straight dialogu like baldur gate similar game present dialogu optionsconclusionth interest stori artstyl almost enough convinc forc other may find entertain play realli hope peopl game beauti tri mani unimport even wrong thing given much attent sadli human stay game look forward long punch face ill watch afar stori progress unfold cant forc continu serious cant recommend game state like even free

"9/10 I definitely recommend getting acquainted with the project.At first, the game may seem superficial and rather ordinary with the usual boring gameplay, but it is not!Starting from the 2nd chapter, it reveals all its strengths, it is interesting to explore, there are many secrets, the combat system develops into a simply crazy mixture of everything you can imagine and a simply colossal assortment of various bosses, only Elden Ring can compete with it!81 ratings from journalists, because they did not really play, the maximum they were able to get to the 2nd chapter and draw conclusions)I think that the game deserves more, and such a huge, large-scale game was made by the developers in just 4 years, it really deserves respect!

"Honestly fantastic game. The campaign though short was fun and made up in length with the operations mode. Multiplayer is fun with great build diversity allowing a fresh experience every time you play it. The visuals are great through out all modes and are honestly some of the best I've seen, My complaints are that I wish there was more cosmetics for chaos in multiplayer and that vanguard needs a nerf for multiplayer lol. Also melee combat can feel a little off sometimes in PvE and PvP but its not a game breaking issue.

"2023 So, the game in my opinion is fantastic and I do not regret buying it, but it does have some severe flaws which the community defends with their lives.I'm not great at writing reviews so forgive me.ProLarge worldOpen worldRan flawlessly on my system at 4k, though I have a 4090 and 13900k so that's not saying muchWeapon selectionMultiple combat stylesGreat charactersBeautiful scenery and graphical modelsSense of progressionMultiple endingsConsEndings were basically the same and very short, very underwhelming after 100 or so hours of gameplay.The inventory system is the worst I have seen in a long time, very difficult to compare item statistics. Despite their insistence on weight being a major part of the mechanics you seem to be able to carry every weapon and armour i the game on your person. I actually didn't realise having ""heavy weight"" was severely limiting my dodge mechanic until 10 hours in at which point the game became significantly easier.I found the consumables in the game generally useless. I ended up using a small lantern for dark areas and health potions. The other items I just hoarded without feeling the need to use them.I listed weapon and armour selection as a pro but I found that I didn't really use them. My starter armor (vanguard) and an early game sword carried me through the entire game. Differences between the armour seemed mostly aesthetic.I didn't really feel I had the opportunity to play with other styles of combat due to heavily investing in my current style of gameplay. Yes you get the option to respec later in the game but by that point I was comfortable and didn't want to suddenly change to a spell caster from melee combat despite the ridiculous amount of spells I was obtaining.No journal or list of completed objectives. Some people can't be glued to the game day after day, there is no excuse for this missing ui element especially due to the very poor quest line progression, and to have it is not ""hand holding"".Little to no guidance on npc questlines, despite what people say on the forums. You can accidentally find an NPC in a random location, get perhaps a hint off them of a quest line and if you are lucky you will encounter the next part of the quest but then not realise its a part of a quest! These quests may only be completed in some scenarios once you have discovered 90% of the game by which time you may have even forgotten the interaction with the npc at the start of the game.You can inadvertently lock yourself out of certain quest progression, miss it completely or with lack of guidance break the quest or fail it instantly. I will give you one example which may be a slight spoiler but it demonstrates the point well. There is a non human npc that wishes to become human, the npc attains this goal and when you chance upon this npc and try to interact with them you get three dots ""..."", rest at a site next to this npc and they will be dead. I looked this up online and it turns out you have to get a random item from a specific set of circumstances which you must activate next to the npc to prevent this. Completely random with no guidance. There is also another major npc at the start of the game you can miss because the only way to find them is to perform an in game emote (which you first have to obtain) at a certain location.Then there is the fact I almost completely missed a major section of the game. The haligtree is a separate area which is optional, to get to this area you must use a medallion at a certain location which is also used with another medallion to progress the main questline. It is not obvious at all that you must use your d-pad to switch medallions to get to the optional area. I even think I missed this as I didn't have the haligtree medallion complete at this point and location became useless after you discover the next bonfire. Again I only discovered this as I approached the last boss of the game and was confused about not encountering certain bosses. A game SHOULD NOT require you to look up questlines online, even if the community defends it by saying ""you should be more observant"", ""you should keep a notepad and write things down"", what ridiculous statements.The start of the game is incredibly difficult (I don't mind this, I actually enjoy it), but once you start levelling and getting used to common enemy animations the game becomes progressively easier to the point of tedium, with the exception of bosses which are compensated with much larger health pools or difficult to dodge AOE attacks.I didn't really dabble in much pvp. I tried it a couple of times as I was forced to from single player content but I ended up being almost 1 shot everytime so I'm not sure what's going on there. That experience put me off exploring that aspect of the game completely.I wish there were some npcs I could enjoy consistently interacting with or keeping the company of. There are a couple of npcs I liked but interaction felt shallow. End game none of the npcs really mattered with the exception of your maiden or if you were going with a specific ending.",game opinion fantast regret buy sever flaw commun defend livesim great write review forgiv meprolarg worldopen worldran flawlessli system though that say muchweapon selectionmultipl combat stylesgreat charactersbeauti sceneri graphic modelssens progressionmultipl endingsconsend basic short underwhelm hour gameplayth inventori system worst seen long time difficult compar item statist despit insist weight major part mechan seem abl carri everi weapon armour game person actual didnt realis heavi weight sever limit dodg mechan hour point game becam significantli easieri found consum game gener useless end use small lantern dark area health potion item hoard without feel need use themi list weapon armour select pro found didnt realli use starter armor vanguard earli game sword carri entir game differ armour seem mostli aesthetici didnt realli feel opportun play style combat due heavili invest current style gameplay ye get option respec later game point comfort didnt want suddenli chang spell caster mele combat despit ridicul amount spell obtainingno journal list complet object peopl cant glu game day day excus miss ui element especi due poor quest line progress hand holdinglittl guidanc npc questlin despit peopl say forum accident find npc random locat get perhap hint quest line lucki encount next part quest realis part quest quest may complet scenario discov game time may even forgotten interact npc start gamey inadvert lock certain quest progress miss complet lack guidanc break quest fail instantli give one exampl may slight spoiler demonstr point well non human npc wish becom human npc attain goal chanc upon npc tri interact get three dot rest site next npc dead look onlin turn get random item specif set circumst must activ next npc prevent complet random guidanc also anoth major npc start game miss way find perform game emot first obtain certain locationthen fact almost complet miss major section game haligtre separ area option get area must use medallion certain locat also use anoth medallion progress main questlin obviou must use dpad switch medallion get option area even think miss didnt haligtre medallion complet point locat becam useless discov next bonfir discov approach last boss game confus encount certain boss game requir look questlin onlin even commun defend say observ keep notepad write thing ridicul statementsth start game incred difficult dont mind actual enjoy start level get use common enemi anim game becom progress easier point tedium except boss compens much larger health pool difficult dodg aoe attacksi didnt realli dabbl much pvp tri coupl time forc singl player content end almost shot everytim im sure what go experi put explor aspect game completelyi wish npc could enjoy consist interact keep compani coupl npc like interact felt shallow end game none npc realli matter except maiden go specif end

Remember all of the DLCs of TW: WH I, II and III are able to be put into the big Immortal Realms Campaign.

"2022 A game that only tells you after you purchase it, that you must agree to let them upload your ""browser network data"" to play it. What?! I totally get games that want to track harmless analytics or diagnostic data for quality improvements to their servers or to find bugs as they patch the game. What does a game developer need with ""browser network data"" though?!On principal alone, I kicked it back for a refund. If you care about the future of gaming, you should too. 14 day refunds are great, but Steam should quit allowing Developers to insert unadvertised usage agreements after the purchase. It's neither an honest, nor valid sale.This might, unfortunately, be one of the most promising game in the last year, but I'll wait for something better.

"VERY FUN, VERY COOL BUY this game",fun cool buy game
"When this game was first shown to the public, I thought it was definitely getting canceled. The second time they showed it, I thought it was just another generic cash grab attempt. The third time, I thought it was too good to be true. When it got released I had no intention of checking it out, but the amount of hype and news surrounding it made me buy the game 2 days after release thinking ""if it's bad I'll just refund"". After playing through just the intro, I decided it wasn't getting refunded no matter what.In recent years, the gaming landscape feels crowded with sequels, reboots, remasters, remakes, uninspired and unoriginal crap close to or straight up plagiarism and potential successes plagued by performance/compatibility issues and terrible practices like microtransactions, lootboxes, live service models, focus on meeting marketing deadlines instead of delivering finished and polished games, etc. It's been so hard to find something to play that I recently loaded up Far Cry 6 just so I could mindlessly shoot things while having some laughs with my friends about how bad the game is (while still managing to be more fun than most other modern games).For me, Black Myth: Wukong stands out as a refreshing entry in the industry, as an action/adventure game with hack and slash combat that punishes you if you attempt to just button mash, blending elements of souslike while having actual lore, cinematic cutscenes and being accessible to casual players, and presenting us with a story rooted in Chinese mythology that we haven't seen before in any large game and is unknown to many westerners, very different from the usual hero against villain we've grown used to.I should say in advance that this game is far from perfect, and it's also not unique in any way (aside from being the first AAA from China). Why then is it highly and widely praised, already among my favorite games of all time and deserving of the Game of the Year award? I think it's because it excels in almost every single aspect, and it's also one of the few recent AAA games that really feels polished and finished on launch. It isn't trying to copy anything, it isn't trying to be something it isn't, there is no unnecessary stuff that makes you think ""why is this even in the game?"".The storytelling is immersive, with amazing voice acting (at least in English and Chinese). At first it looks like the classic journey of growth and redemption after the hero's downfall, but you soon realize it is told in a more darker and natural tone, with your character having it's flaws pointed out and frowned upon constantly both by your opponents and allies. You're not the typical hero (heck, you're not even the Monkey King, you're just a monkey which might be destined to fulfill Sun Wukong's path, and depending on your actions during the game you fail and the cycle just continues until another monkey is able to complete the journey). At the end of each chapter you get a cutscene, some look like modern animes, some look like something from Studio Ghibli, and some are claymation, which gives a nice touch to the story.The graphics are simply amazing, it's one of the best looking games out there along with Alan Wake 2 and Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. Full Ray Tracing is amazingly implemented, and so are the upscaling technologies. Performance is surprisingly stable and optimized. For some reason it's missing proper HDR support, making some areas burn your retina with excessive brightness while other areas are pitch dark. I've seen a lot of people complaining about the forced DOF and low-res textures blended in the high-res world. While I'm against the lack of customizable options, i think the DOF in this game could be perfect if toned down just a bit, and even the low-res textures have a place in the game, since it creates a sense of depth in the scene. You can easily recognize what is playable ground and what is just filling the scenario, you can differentiate between important places and places you can't even reach, and if everything had the same amount of detail the world would just be a overly sharp mess.The level design is the only weak point in my opinion, but I'm used to FromSoftware games, so that's tough competition, and I don't know how it compares to similar games in the genre since I don't usually play them. The world is beautifully crafted, but you can't explore it that much. I don't mind the invisible walls since it's not an open world game, but they could definitely be better placed. The chapters are pretty linear, sometimes you will be offered at most two different paths, but these paths loop around and lead you to the same place in the end.Soundtrack is good, sometimes you don't pay much attention to it, sometimes it enhances the atmosphere, and sometimes it completely steals the show like the Headless Monk in Chapter 2, the Yaksha King fight, the moments leading up to obtaining Jingubang in the cave, The Great Sage's Broken Shell fight, etc. The gameplay is fluid, with a challenging but fair difficulty. The combat is dynamic and fast paced, but you still have to pay attention to your resources and the enemies actions. There are a lot of unlockable skills, three different staff instances that serve different purposes, a few spells that require planning to use or you just waste your mana and cooldowns, different equipments that can alter your playstyle, and consumables that can give you the edge in a battle when you feel the boss is simply stronger than you. Removing the staff throw was a bad decision since we're left with zero ranged attacks.The game has a nice pace, at no point I felt tired, bored, or stuck. The narrative is layered and ensures you stay invested throughout the whole thing. I wasn't familiar at all with Journey to the West (aside from the Monkey King character), but now I feel like consuming more media related to it. The game has 2 endings, and I find both are perfect. The first one (called the Bad Ending) is the default one and has the player monkey character fight the Stone Monkey and The Great Sage's Broken Shell (which are the mindless and spiritless body of the original Sun Wukong), only to find out you accomplished the same success but also the same failures, having the golden headband fitted in your head and taking the broken shell's place, awaiting until the true destined monkey fulfills Sun Wukong's destiny. The second ending (called the True Ending) requires you to complete a lot of optional tasks and fight Erlang, which is presented in the very first scene of the game as an archnemesis, and as a result you unveil some truths about both his intentions and Sun Wukong's actions. The monkey recovers all of Sun Wukong's memories, and ends up rejecting the golden headband, finally uniting all of the six relics and proving to be indeed the Destined One, rising again as Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, and leaving room for an expasion or a second game. Black Myth: Wukong somehow managed to surpass it's expectations which were already extremely high, and it should set a new benchmark for future games in the genre. Shoutout to the developers who started it as a passion project and made their first public showcase as a means of attracting more people to the team instead of trying to sell an unfinished product.tl;dr: reject buddhahood, return to monkey",game first shown public thought definit get cancel second time show thought anoth gener cash grab attempt third time thought good true got releas intent check amount hype news surround made buy game day releas think bad ill refund play intro decid wasnt get refund matter whatin recent year game landscap feel crowd sequel reboot remast remak uninspir unorigin crap close straight plagiar potenti success plagu performancecompat issu terribl practic like microtransact lootbox live servic model focu meet market deadlin instead deliv finish polish game etc hard find someth play recent load far cri could mindlessli shoot thing laugh friend bad game still manag fun modern gamesfor black myth wukong stand refresh entri industri actionadventur game hack slash combat punish attempt button mash blend element souslik actual lore cinemat cutscen access casual player present us stori root chines mytholog havent seen larg game unknown mani western differ usual hero villain weve grown use toi say advanc game far perfect also uniqu way asid first aaa china highli wide prais alreadi among favorit game time deserv game year award think excel almost everi singl aspect also one recent aaa game realli feel polish finish launch isnt tri copi anyth isnt tri someth isnt unnecessari stuff make think even gameth storytel immers amaz voic act least english chines first look like classic journey growth redempt hero downfal soon realiz told darker natur tone charact flaw point frown upon constantli oppon alli your typic hero heck your even monkey king your monkey might destin fulfil sun wukong path depend action game fail cycl continu anoth monkey abl complet journey end chapter get cutscen look like modern anim look like someth studio ghibli claymat give nice touch storyth graphic simpli amaz one best look game along alan wake senua saga hellblad ii full ray trace amazingli implement upscal technolog perform surprisingli stabl optim reason miss proper hdr support make area burn retina excess bright area pitch dark ive seen lot peopl complain forc dof lowr textur blend highr world im lack customiz option think dof game could perfect tone bit even lowr textur place game sinc creat sens depth scene easili recogn playabl ground fill scenario differenti import place place cant even reach everyth amount detail world would overli sharp messth level design weak point opinion im use fromsoftwar game that tough competit dont know compar similar game genr sinc dont usual play world beauti craft cant explor much dont mind invis wall sinc open world game could definit better place chapter pretti linear sometim offer two differ path path loop around lead place endsoundtrack good sometim dont pay much attent sometim enhanc atmospher sometim complet steal show like headless monk chapter yaksha king fight moment lead obtain jingubang cave great sage broken shell fight etc gameplay fluid challeng fair difficulti combat dynam fast pace still pay attent resourc enemi action lot unlock skill three differ staff instanc serv differ purpos spell requir plan use wast mana cooldown differ equip alter playstyl consum give edg battl feel boss simpli stronger remov staff throw bad decis sinc left zero rang attacksth game nice pace point felt tire bore stuck narr layer ensur stay invest throughout whole thing wasnt familiar journey west asid monkey king charact feel like consum media relat game end find perfect first one call bad end default one player monkey charact fight stone monkey great sage broken shell mindless spiritless bodi origin sun wukong find accomplish success also failur golden headband fit head take broken shell place await true destin monkey fulfil sun wukong destini second end call true end requir complet lot option task fight erlang present first scene game archnemesi result unveil truth intent sun wukong action monkey recov sun wukong memori end reject golden headband final unit six relic prove inde destin one rise sun wukong monkey king leav room expas second game black myth wukong somehow manag surpass expect alreadi extrem high set new benchmark futur game genr shoutout develop start passion project made first public showcas mean attract peopl team instead tri sell unfinish producttldr reject buddhahood return monkey

"2016 Counter-Strike: Global OffensivePros of the game: A new additional line of weapons to play around with, each having better improvements to handling. Though beware, some updates can nerf these, since CS:GO patches can be unreliable at times. Cool and stylish weapon graphics you can purchase over the market for personalising your own, unique firearm selections. The new game mode selections of competitive, casual, death-match, arms race (formally known as gun-game), and demolition. A whole new range of maps on top of the remastered originals. All the more Counter-Terrorist and Terrorist skins players will have featured during different level matches. They've laid off including the 'lifetime stats' section a fair bit, with only game achievements this time featured on player profiles, making it much more pleasant for perfectionists like myself instead of feeling like always needing to improve on things all the more. I can just get that sense gnawing at me sometimes to ‘do better’ when I always have to see stats in my face, even with it already sound. The achievements themselves being lesser in kill counts for weapons than before, making it much more tolerable and faster to get through. Having the addition of game music, such as the main menu theme, the match-starting theme and the victory themes are quite nice for a game jingle. Plus the addition of custom theme tracks you can get for your client.Cons of the game: The match-making system for Competitive having constant flaws. Competitive players you can come across in 80% of random matches being complete idiots and / or trolls, as well as those who try to get the whole team to surrender from a 'bad start' at the beginning of a game itself - even if you're carrying to give a worthwhile chance. To put it simple; the majority of games have players who are absolutely horrendous at listening to team tactics, then can also try kicking you thinking they’re a 'top-gun', when in reality they’re the ones who suck. Basically; you never got this in CS:S, as everyone knew the usual play of routine and worked together. In this it just seems to have gone right out the window. There's still players you will come across who hack and use aim-bot, walls, etc, legitimately (and not just as some cry out with people hacking since they're actually good). The liberty at least is the game features a player reporting system you can consult while playing, where you can submit a claim for staff to investigate if you feel a player is literally hacking. If they're found guilty; you'll have a confirmation message show up later on your main menu screen that action had been taken against them - most commonly being banned from community servers. As with the Counter-Strike franchise; there shall always be unfortunate hit-box issues - with the all familiar problem of blood splatter appearing on an enemy, yet they have no or hardly any damage rendered at all.Competitive is a joke really. You’re not even getting anything for wins besides a pointless ‘rank’ score (which at that is only effected by your chance of having MVP’s and winning, and not your actual kill / death score as it should be based upon), and if you know you’re good - you’re good. Even getting to 'Legendary Eagle' prior myself, I’m frankly not caring anymore or playing consecutively, as it’s so boring without proper teams of friends like back in CS:S league matches. The 'weapon crates' from the point system you actually have to fork out more than they're worth to open, usually getting something cheap wasting your money.Personal feedback rating: 7.5 out of 10.",counterstrik global offensivepro game new addit line weapon play around better improv handl though bewar updat nerf sinc csgo patch unreli time cool stylish weapon graphic purchas market personalis uniqu firearm select new game mode select competit casual deathmatch arm race formal known gungam demolit whole new rang map top remast origin counterterrorist terrorist skin player featur differ level match theyv laid includ lifetim stat section fair bit game achiev time featur player profil make much pleasant perfectionist like instead feel like alway need improv thing get sens gnaw sometim better alway see stat face even alreadi sound achiev lesser kill count weapon make much toler faster get addit game music main menu theme matchstart theme victori theme quit nice game jingl plu addit custom theme track get clientcon game matchmak system competit constant flaw competit player come across random match complet idiot troll well tri get whole team surrend bad start begin game even your carri give worthwhil chanc put simpl major game player absolut horrend listen team tactic also tri kick think theyr topgun realiti theyr one suck basic never got css everyon knew usual play routin work togeth seem gone right window there still player come across hack use aimbot wall etc legitim cri peopl hack sinc theyr actual good liberti least game featur player report system consult play submit claim staff investig feel player liter hack theyr found guilti youll confirm messag show later main menu screen action taken commonli ban commun server counterstrik franchis shall alway unfortun hitbox issu familiar problem blood splatter appear enemi yet hardli damag render allcompetit joke realli your even get anyth win besid pointless rank score effect chanc mvp win actual kill death score base upon know your good your good even get legendari eagl prior im frankli care anymor play consecut bore without proper team friend like back css leagu match weapon crate point system actual fork theyr worth open usual get someth cheap wast moneyperson feedback rate

On the PLUS: Huge campaign map, insane number of factions you can play, each feeling different and playing different> Even different starts within the same faction feel different. Overall great game.On the MINUS: Huge game. The learning curve is massively brutal! Playing the 1st and 2nd game before playing this one is basically required. Immortal empires map is the actual game here, however, even if recently the publisher removed the hard requirement for you to own Warhammer I and II in order to play, you still have to own those and DLC in order to play almost all factions. Seeing how many of us own Warhammer I on Epic because we got it free as an old game, it is highly recommended to get this one over on Epic, as ownership does not carry over between Epic and Steam. Sorry Steam!Also, the price tag is just stupid and greedy! 157 eu ON SALE for this full title alone, not to mention the soft requirement to own the old ones and their DLC for the full thing.For this reason alone I do not recommend this title.",great game best entir total war game seri plu huge campaign map insan number faction play feel differ play differ even differ start within faction feel differ overal great gameon minu huge game learn curv massiv brutal play game play one basic requir immort empir map actual game howev even recent publish remov hard requir warhamm ii order play still dlc order play almost faction see mani us warhamm epic got free old game highli recommend get one epic ownership carri epic steam sorri steamalso price tag stupid greedi eu sale full titl alon mention soft requir old one dlc full thingfor reason alon recommend titl

"2023 As someone who has played the Total War series and was introduced to it through Warhammer 1, it saddens me to see the complete and utter disarray going on with it climactic entry.I've never willingly written a review with the intention to 'review bomb' a title into oblivion as quite often people will do it just because of X,Y or Z reason.However, on this occasion I feel justified in adding my voice to the choir of fans who are tired of simply being used as CA's bottom line to feed their short term monetary gain while being drip fed a patch every several months which tend to break more things than they fix.They say we are listened to but there is no back an forth. Content creators have told them repeatedly about things in the past that the community will end up not liking; they ignore them and push on anyway. They trim down DLC to the bare minimum while increasing the price of it with the excuse of ""Everything has went up in price, if you don't buy it, we will kill support for the game."" Good luck getting people to purchase your future TW titles with that attitude. Greedy business practises and shareholders have turned the games industry into a money making racket while both developers to an extent and consumers suffer for their greed. Keep the consumer happy and your bank accounts and games will flourish. How many times does this lesson need to be repeated to publishers and studios? It is not my ambition or want to see the TW series or CA close shop. People are employed by them and are trying to make a living. However I cannot in good conscience recommend this game or its DLC content at the current moment in time due to shady, greedy and outright laughably insulting business practises.",someon play total war seri introduc warhamm sadden see complet utter disarray go climact entryiv never willingli written review intent review bomb titl oblivion quit often peopl xy z reasonhowev occas feel justifi ad voic choir fan tire simpli use ca bottom line feed short term monetari gain drip fed patch everi sever month tend break thing fixthey say listen back forth content creator told repeatedli thing past commun end like ignor push anyway trim dlc bare minimum increas price excus everyth went price dont buy kill support game good luck get peopl purchas futur tw titl attitud greedi busi practis sharehold turn game industri money make racket develop extent consum suffer greed keep consum happi bank account game flourish mani time lesson need repeat publish studio ambit want see tw seri ca close shop peopl employ tri make live howev good conscienc recommend game dlc content current moment time due shadi greedi outright laughabl insult busi practis

You can tell they actually buckled down on MANY of the common negatives that plagued the game prior.They added value to the DLC. The new packs that came out are really fun. Though I wish a parts of it were complimentary with the game purchase, they did a great job nonetheless. Empire is kind of relevant again, Kislev has a chance of not getting completely steamrolled, hell even Nurgle is fun. They also worked on the good v evil factions in that most of the bad factions will ally with one another, and most of the good factions will align also. Previously if you played say Skaven, you're in a weird spot where no one likes you, good nor bad. It's no longer the case.

"Product received for free Black Myth: Wukong is not the game that you think it is. The opening is strong, with gorgeous visuals, incredible art direction and mystifying enemy and boss design. The problems begin however when the introduction is over and the real game begins. Black Myth Wukong dresses itself as an RPG but this is only superficial. In reality, Black Myth Wukong is a Boss Rush. There's very little downtime between boss fights, often moving directly from one fight into another. When there is something in-between, the game offers only linear levels with nothing in the way of exploration.That's not to say that the game isn't entirely without merit. Visually the game is a feast for the eyes, and the music and sound design are top quality. The combat system is as visually pleasing as it is mechanically deep, there's an array of skills, spells, transformations, items and equipment at the players disposal.However, this variety is hampered by the totally linear progression, armour and weapons are not found in the game world, they are unlocked in the shop after an arbitrary amount of progress has been made. Likewise for spells and skills which are only unlocked after specific points of the story. This leaves the game severely lacking in player agency, there's no decision making in where to go or in what order you progress the story, each ""level"" of the game is a beautifully decorated corridor with a boss waiting for you at the end and even within a scant few hours, the shallow game-play loop becomes immediately apparent. The boss rush nature of the game falls flat without the framing behind it. Bosses that have fantastic visual design have no framing within the story, there's little to no lore or explanation behind the enemies you're facing and it can leave you erratically jumping from one quirky boss fight to another with a feeling of disconnect. Without this framing, the significance of the boss is lost and what could have been a grandiose fight becomes a pedestrian affair, each boss becomes just another box to tick on your road to the end of the game.Black Myth: Wukong is a spectacle, for sure, but it feels like it's using that spectacle as a crutch to distract from how little depth there to the gameplay, it feels like all of the mechanics of a good RPG were created, they just forgot to create the world to go with it.",product receiv free black myth wukong game think open strong gorgeou visual incred art direct mystifi enemi boss design problem begin howev introduct real game begin black myth wukong dress rpg superfici realiti black myth wukong boss rush there littl downtim boss fight often move directli one fight anoth someth inbetween game offer linear level noth way explorationthat say game isnt entir without merit visual game feast eye music sound design top qualiti combat system visual pleas mechan deep there array skill spell transform item equip player disposalhowev varieti hamper total linear progress armour weapon found game world unlock shop arbitrari amount progress made likewis spell skill unlock specif point stori leav game sever lack player agenc there decis make go order progress stori level game beauti decor corridor boss wait end even within scant hour shallow gameplay loop becom immedi appar boss rush natur game fall flat without frame behind boss fantast visual design frame within stori there littl lore explan behind enemi your face leav errat jump one quirki boss fight anoth feel disconnect without frame signific boss lost could grandios fight becom pedestrian affair boss becom anoth box tick road end gameblack myth wukong spectacl sure feel like use spectacl crutch distract littl depth gameplay feel like mechan good rpg creat forgot creat world go

"2022 I have been an avid Total War fan for about 20 years. There are only 2 titles in the entire franchise I would not recommend, Attila, and this one. I was first turned off by the blatant money grubbery of the DLC's containing content already in the game, just not usable by the player until you pay. No big deal, I just wont pay. 20 dollars for a new faction with 2 new units? Fuh huh hunnnk you.But I digress. Every other Total War game promotes expansion, this one punishes it. Every other Total War game has massive replay potential. This one had next to none. You ask, but hey guy, you have over 200 hours on this game. That means you like it. I am ashamed to say I was forcing myself to play to get achievements and trying to like it. The rift mechanic in the game is the exact same for every faction you play, and it sucks for all of them. First time play through was OK, slightly annoying. After that, when you get a warning the rifts are about to pop, your heart drops as your fun is about to end and the prostate exam is about to begin.If you are new to the series do not be turned off by this. Get 3 kingdoms, Warhammer 1 or 2 instead. Troy is a very simple version good for new players. Do not pay for the overpriced DLC's. It just makes it seem OK in their eyes, and they will keep doing it.This game may be worth it when the Immortal Empires DLC comes out. Should give you the ability to turn off the rift mechanic and just play Total War.",avid total war fan year titl entir franchis would recommend attila one first turn blatant money grubberi dlc contain content alreadi game usabl player pay big deal wont pay dollar new faction new unit fuh huh hunnnk youbut digress everi total war game promot expans one punish everi total war game massiv replay potenti one next none ask hey guy hour game mean like asham say forc play get achiev tri like rift mechan game exact everi faction play suck first time play ok slightli annoy get warn rift pop heart drop fun end prostat exam beginif new seri turn get kingdom warhamm instead troy simpl version good new player pay overpr dlc make seem ok eye keep itthi game may worth immort empir dlc come give abil turn rift mechan play total war

"Game looks very nice. The campaign is only about 10h but multiplayer will add a lot of game time. But there is some severe problems with that part. Hacking is rampant in PvP and ive seen some in PvE, and for some reason there is no report button, and devs dont seem to take it seriously. Which is unfortunate because its hurting the game greatly.There is also some balancing issue with the game. Some mechanic require some locked animation to happen like gunstrikes. The problem is that you cant move while it happens, takes a few seconds and you dont have any invisibility frames during that time. You will die often because of this. There is also ranged enemies, that will spam shoot without end through other enemies and walls. Your armor is very weak and you dont have a lot of health. In the right circumstances, you can execute a gunstrike (being locked in animation) and have a bunch a small range enemies shoot at you and its game over. Gunstrike will also happen by mistake sometime. You are punished for using game mechanics and I dont know if that will be patched yet, as the only thing the devs released was a fix to spread core usage (game was only using like 5 cores and would BSOD your PC from the main menu for some).I do think there is a solid game here, but its apparent that the devs didnt test most of it before releasing, creating all these small problems that adds up to a bad experience sometimes. I will change my review if they ever decide to speak up and fix these issue.",game look nice campaign multiplay add lot game time sever problem part hack rampant pvp ive seen pve reason report button dev dont seem take serious unfortun hurt game greatlyther also balanc issu game mechan requir lock anim happen like gunstrik problem cant move happen take second dont invis frame time die often also rang enemi spam shoot without end enemi wall armor weak dont lot health right circumst execut gunstrik lock anim bunch small rang enemi shoot game gunstrik also happen mistak sometim punish use game mechan dont know patch yet thing dev releas fix spread core usag game use like core would bsod pc main menu somei think solid game appar dev didnt test releas creat small problem add bad experi sometim chang review ever decid speak fix issu

"2022 ELDEN RING SOULS LIKE FOR EVERYONE What I learned in 50 hours. - During this time, I realized that this is one of the BEST games in its genre! It has all the good mechanics from the old From Software games, and most importantly - the jump to a separate button (Thanks to Miyazaki!). The game has a good balance between weapon classes for pve (not tested pvp). In fact, you can play with what you like. Game Bosses As a plus, I can also include story bosses, they are diverse and not pretentious (suitable for the style of the game). There is little that I can say about optional ones, there are too many of them and they are repeated and boring, the same Erdtree Avatar, of which there are too many, but that doesn't stop you from enjoying the game. The game has bosses for anyone, ranging from junk (Tibia Mariner and the like), ending with Malenia, because of which the game was abandoned a lot, without passing it. The world and its content The world of Elden's ring is beautiful and large, but mostly empty. You will have to run a lot here, but you can find some kind of dungeon with loot and a boss while you are going through the story, this kept me in the game. I love to explore the worlds in these games. For me, as a new player in this genre (before that, ds3 passed, a month before the release of Elden Ring), I was very pleased with the presence of an open world, when avid players of the series criticized the developer for something I don’t understand. In terms of the content of the game world, there is a lot of it, wherever I go, find a new cave, a new boss, a friendly NPC, and the like.storyline of Elden ring (No spoilers) As part of the plot, I will say one thing, I did not understand anything, you need to read the description of objects, read the dialogue between the lines. In general, he is confused, as Miyazaki loves. But it's worth it, at least once to go through the game. Result As a result, I want to say that the developers have done a great job on the game, so I recommend that every gamer go through it, regardless of the fact that he is casual or true hardcore! 10/10",elden ring soul like everyon learn hour time realiz one best game genr good mechan old softwar game importantli jump separ button thank miyazaki game good balanc weapon class pve test pvp fact play like game boss plu also includ stori boss divers pretenti suitabl style game littl say option one mani repeat bore erdtre avatar mani doesnt stop enjoy game game boss anyon rang junk tibia marin like end malenia game abandon lot without pass world content world elden ring beauti larg mostli empti run lot find kind dungeon loot boss go stori kept game love explor world game new player genr pass month releas elden ring pleas presenc open world avid player seri critic develop someth dont understand term content game world lot wherev go find new cave new boss friendli npc likestorylin elden ring spoiler part plot say one thing understand anyth need read descript object read dialogu line gener confus miyazaki love worth least go game result result want say develop done great job game recommend everi gamer go regardless fact casual true hardcor
"2022 Highlighted keywords in bold so you can skip or read parts of your concern.*UPDATE* 20/04/22 - There is now an option to disable camera auto centering. This is a huge deal for KB/mouse players.tl;dr Pros - Art Direction Variety of unique boss battles and even regular mobs. Just the sheer amount of content, explorable areas, variety of weapons, items, etc. Challenging without feeling unfair 99.99% of the time. Variety of viable builds. Everything in this game including your character's chest hair has a hidden lore behind it.tl;dr Cons - PC Port is extremely lacking. Graphics options doesn't seem to change performance much at all. Feels like a lazy port. Mouse and KB aren't being utilised to their fullest potential, I suspect, to match the limitations of a controller. Leads to some weird and unintuitive controls if you're playing on mouse and KB. (played on both, slightly prefer mouse/KB more) Camera needs some improvement. Wiki/youtube is an essential part of doing some quests. It would be near impossible to figure out what to do in certain side quests on your own on a regular playthrough. Co-op and PvP could be improved, but it's passable.tl;dr Conclusion -Despite the flaws, I think it's still a masterpiece. Game needs a good CPU to get playable FPS. It might be intimidating at first if you've never played a previous souls title like me, but it's definitely a rewarding experience. Definitely recommend buying, you will not regret it. If you're new to the series, try not to screw up your build early on and put some points into vigor if you don't wanna have a miserable time.PC Specific Pros and Cons -I've played on both controller and keyboard/mouse for a fair amount of time. And since it's a review for PC version of a game, I think it's important to talk about KB/mouse implementation. It's much easier and faster to look around on mouse than it is on controller, so you can look around and avoid attacks of colossal/large bosses easier. However there's an annoying auto centering which can't be disabled, so you will be constantly fighting the camera as you move. You also can't use all the on your keyboard and some weird keybindings like ""G"" key for map are set by default and cannot be changed. You also can't set any key you want for item wheel/secondary item wheel like you would expect on a PC game. You need to use from a limited selection of keys/key combination for primary and secondary item wheel which is really unintuitive if you're playing on KB and mouse and you will find it hard to set up comfortable key configurations due to weird limitations. You will settle for some weird keybindings at the end inevitably. You also can't bind spells and incantation to specific keys. I suspect these are all intentional design choice made to match the controller limitations. I highly dislike these limitation and don't think it's justified to artificially handicap you for playing on a certain platform and not using the platform's fullest potential instead. More than anything, they're just annoying to deal with and I don't expect these to be changed. A lot of the performance issues seem to stem from Easy Anti Cheat from what I've seen.General Pros -The art direction is easily the best part of the game. A lot of the scenary looks like they're straight out of a painting. Pretty much every build type seems viable, except maybe bows and crossbows. You might have to adapt for certain fights if you're playing a mage or a strength/slow attack build but other than that, everything should be viable. Most of the boss design is also great, none of them feel like a throwaway boss design. Speaking of bosses, all of the bosses have unique movesets that you have to learn how to dodge, avoid, etc. 99.99% of them doesn't feel like they're unfair once you get the hang of the game. There are so many locations to explore including a whole underground area, caves, catacombs, dungeons and so many hidden areas/missions/things to find. You will not be disappointed by the amount of content in the game, that's for sure. Also for people that are complaining that the game's too hard and/or wanting an easy mode, there abosultely is easy mode in this game. Spirit summons, AI summons and even multiplayer summons all make the game basically easy mode, if utilised properly. So I think it's unfair to call the game ""too hard"", the game does give you an option to choose the difficulty you wanna play in. If you don't like certain gameplay mechanic or system, there's always a workaround. I personally think the freedom of choice the game provides is excellent. I'm split on the music, while some of them are absolutely epic (Godskin Apostle, Morgott, Radagon), most of the themes aren't memorable past the fight and the ambient music is lackluster.General Cons -Camera is probably the worst part of souls games. It's inexcusable that after so many years/games, the devs still haven't figured out how to make proper a camera system. A lot of the deaths will be due to you not being able to see where you are on the environment/where the boss is/what move the boss is performing. The camera tracking is poor when locked on, it's too slow to turn around if you aren't locked on due to auto centering. There's input queuing in the game, which is fine for the most part and I get it's there to stop people from spamming buttons. But what I don't get is, when you are trying to dodge an enemy attack but get caught in it, due to input queue, the game will make you dodge roll AFTER you get hit and recover, which leads to you getting hit by a follow up attack a lot of the times and maybe even dying. I don't understand why you should be punished after being punished once already. It creates a lot of frustrations especially since dodge on this game happens on button release so there's already a few millisecond delay from when you tried to dodge roll initially. It's especially noticeable in fast paced fights. A lot of the side quests are impossible to do it on your own without looking up what to do or where to go on wiki/youtube. For example, one side quest requires you to find hidden stairs at a different part of the map (that will reveal itself when hit) in order to proceed. Not to mention, the map in this game is massive so finding out what to do on your own for some quests is practically impossible on a regular playthrough. I know it's a design choice but if it's something that you would not enjoy, it's worth keeping in mind. IMO a decent solution for it would be an optional journal feature like in skyrim that gives you some hints, that way you can completely ignore or look at it if you just wanna get done with the quest and play on your own without looking for external guides. If you're looking to buy this game for co-op reasons, I'd suggest looking into how co op works before you buy. Co-op is quite limited and not straight forward as you'd expect. There's also invasions in co-op where other players will try to kill you if you're in a co-op party. It might be a pro or a con depending on what you might be looking for. PvP is... passable. It's not the most balanced thing ever or anything but it's ok.Conclusion - Flaws of this game aren't so great that they invalidate the experience. I think it's definitely worth the full price. Even if you're new to souls games(like me), you will definitely enjoy the game. Definitely a GOTY contender. With all that said, I do hope the devs iron out the issues facing the PC version.",highlight keyword bold skip read part concernupd option disabl camera auto center huge deal kbmous playerstldr pro art direct varieti uniqu boss battl even regular mob sheer amount content explor area varieti weapon item etc challeng without feel unfair time varieti viabl build everyth game includ charact chest hair hidden lore behind ittldr con pc port extrem lack graphic option doesnt seem chang perform much feel like lazi port mous kb arent utilis fullest potenti suspect match limit control lead weird unintuit control your play mous kb play slightli prefer mousekb camera need improv wikiyoutub essenti part quest would near imposs figur certain side quest regular playthrough coop pvp could improv passabletldr conclus despit flaw think still masterpiec game need good cpu get playabl fp might intimid first youv never play previou soul titl like definit reward experi definit recommend buy regret your new seri tri screw build earli put point vigor dont wan na miser timepc specif pro con ive play control keyboardmous fair amount time sinc review pc version game think import talk kbmous implement much easier faster look around mous control look around avoid attack colossallarg boss easier howev there annoy auto center cant disabl constantli fight camera move also cant use keyboard weird keybind like g key map set default chang also cant set key want item wheelsecondari item wheel like would expect pc game need use limit select keyskey combin primari secondari item wheel realli unintuit your play kb mous find hard set comfort key configur due weird limit settl weird keybind end inevit also cant bind spell incant specif key suspect intent design choic made match control limit highli dislik limit dont think justifi artifici handicap play certain platform use platform fullest potenti instead anyth theyr annoy deal dont expect chang lot perform issu seem stem easi anti cheat ive seengener pro art direct easili best part game lot scenari look like theyr straight paint pretti much everi build type seem viabl except mayb bow crossbow might adapt certain fight your play mage strengthslow attack build everyth viabl boss design also great none feel like throwaway boss design speak boss boss uniqu moveset learn dodg avoid etc doesnt feel like theyr unfair get hang game mani locat explor includ whole underground area cave catacomb dungeon mani hidden areasmissionsth find disappoint amount content game that sure also peopl complain game hard andor want easi mode abosult easi mode game spirit summon ai summon even multiplay summon make game basic easi mode utilis properli think unfair call game hard game give option choos difficulti wan na play dont like certain gameplay mechan system there alway workaround person think freedom choic game provid excel im split music absolut epic godskin apostl morgott radagon theme arent memor past fight ambient music lacklustergener con camera probabl worst part soul game inexcus mani yearsgam dev still havent figur make proper camera system lot death due abl see environmentwher boss iswhat move boss perform camera track poor lock slow turn around arent lock due auto center there input queu game fine part get stop peopl spam button dont get tri dodg enemi attack get caught due input queue game make dodg roll get hit recov lead get hit follow attack lot time mayb even die dont understand punish punish alreadi creat lot frustrat especi sinc dodg game happen button releas there alreadi millisecond delay tri dodg roll initi especi notic fast pace fight lot side quest imposs without look go wikiyoutub exampl one side quest requir find hidden stair differ part map reveal hit order proceed mention map game massiv find quest practic imposs regular playthrough know design choic someth would enjoy worth keep mind imo decent solut would option journal featur like skyrim give hint way complet ignor look wan na get done quest play without look extern guid your look buy game coop reason id suggest look co op work buy coop quit limit straight forward youd expect there also invas coop player tri kill your coop parti might pro con depend might look pvp passabl balanc thing ever anyth okconclus flaw game arent great invalid experi think definit worth full price even your new soul gameslik definit enjoy game definit goti contend said hope dev iron issu face pc version

"Spreadsheet simulator My experience so far is that if i hammer&anvil a t3 unit, i'm wasting my time, since it's not going to break anyways, even with cycle charging.Hell, even t1 units will hold through the first two or three rear charges. Nothing ever routs or dies.The AI is content to stand still at the worst position in the entire map, when it is on the defensive, even if there is better ground easily available to it. That doesn't really impact the game much though, because momentum doesn't impact the effectiveness of your charges, and once you've actually closed into melee, the difference of what is high ground and not, is minuscule. Not to mention that even for gunpowder infantry, Line of Sight is just a gentle suggestion. All this together means that Instead of asking you to make the most of where you put your units, the game instead asks you to make the most of the unit matchups, with not only the basics rock-paper-scissors of swords>spears>cav, but actually a whole web of interactions of armor, armor-piercing, magic attacks, regenerating/fire attacks, anti-large, poison attacks, and probably more that i don't know about yet. It's complex, but i don't know that there is actually that much depth to it. Maybe i'll find it later, but while starting out, it's just a knowledge check, instead of more intuitive mechanics, like positioning will be.Then there's the ridiculous power of lords, and heroes that significantly reduces the value of well commanded units, as their unit size means they are fairly agnostic to being surrounded, and just become a stat-block with abilities that you gotta eat through. The spells also generally are more disruptive of good tactics than they can help facilitate them. They further push everything to being blobs of stat-blocks being crunched together. Same goes for artillery: because it's powerful enough that you can't ignore it, it pushes you towards engaging the enemy as soon as possible, meaning you aren't really allowed to have an extended skirmish phase.Also, on a personal preference, it feels like ranged units areeither outputing too much damage, or are too sturdy. The advantage ofthe majority of the units not being able to hit you back is alreadyenough incentive to bring ranged units.Come to think of it, there isn't actually a single core battle system i actually like the design of. Individual units, or faction mechanics, sure, but not the core systems.",spreadsheet simul experi far hammeranvil unit im wast time sinc go break anyway even cycl charginghel even unit hold first two three rear charg noth ever rout diesth ai content stand still worst posit entir map defens even better ground easili avail doesnt realli impact game much though momentum doesnt impact effect charg youv actual close mele differ high ground minuscul mention even gunpowd infantri line sight gentl suggest togeth mean instead ask make put unit game instead ask make unit matchup basic rockpaperscissor swordsspearscav actual whole web interact armor armorpierc magic attack regeneratingfir attack antilarg poison attack probabl dont know yet complex dont know actual much depth mayb ill find later start knowledg check instead intuit mechan like posit bethen there ridicul power lord hero significantli reduc valu well command unit unit size mean fairli agnost surround becom statblock abil got ta eat spell also gener disrupt good tactic help facilit push everyth blob statblock crunch togeth goe artilleri power enough cant ignor push toward engag enemi soon possibl mean arent realli allow extend skirmish phasealso person prefer feel like rang unit areeith output much damag sturdi advantag ofth major unit abl hit back alreadyenough incent bring rang unitscom think isnt actual singl core battl system actual like design individu unit faction mechan sure core system
"Hard to believe that this is the developer's first major work.This is all around a pretty great game, with very well telegraphed enemies and lots of fun to be had. While the game borrows quite a bit from the typical souls-like formula, it manages to distinguish itself enough to offer a unique experience. The game also has a way heavier focus on boss fights, more than you might expect. In fact, at times, it wouldn't be a stretch to call it a borderline boss-rush, as you can sometimes face one boss right after another with barely a minute in between. Theres also the visuals. Honestly, I'm not sure if this even needs to be said, but the overall visual presentation is unquestionably among the best in the medium, just make sure to turn off the god awful framegen. Despite that, the game somehow runs pretty well.Probably the most frustrating aspect of the game so far are invisible walls, which are quite plentiful, fairly disappointing considering i thought those kind of things were left in the PS3 era, but not a huge issue on its own.

"2022 The Short: I didn’t really think what everyone was clamoring for was the Ubisoft-ification of Dark Souls. The Long: Pros-Jump Button?-Music-Horse Combat (mostly)*-Fun*-Addictive*Cons-Shockingly Laggy-Movement is Jank-The world seems very empty-Stamina consumption feels random-Graphics are often ugly and washed out-Ditches many of the better systems from previous games-Walked back some of the better ideas from the Network Tests-Flailing*-You need the wiki*-Where did my legs go?*- Why did my monitor stop working?*- It Crashed again* Mostly it’s Dark Souls 3, but bigger and with extra tat tacked on, and yet somehow the whole thing feels a bit cheap. It’s a big, mostly empty open world with dodgy traversal mechanics. The few hours I played were mostly hiding in bushes collecting flowers. The new sneaking around can be fun in an Assassins Creed way, but in the one camp I found, enemies tend to be in line of site of one another and the backstab is slow enough to leave you open. From what little I saw you can’t really build a character around stealth. Before too long I found a gatehouse where the archer can spot you through cover and bosses/ boss adjacent monsters really won’t let you get away with it like in the aforementioned Ubisoft sandboxes. Really, the game is done no favors comparing it to Assassins Creed as it’s often a very ugly game. Assets pop in, creatures disappear, and all the colors feel very washed out. That’s not uncommon for From Software games but from the character creation screen it looked like a marked improvement over DS3. Sadly, in game models are low rez, with larger ones having hard corners that show the limited poly count. Many assets seem to be copy pasted giving the whole experience a very cheap feel. Not helped by the fact that the Prolog is a Slideshow. Makes me wonder what could be causing all the lag. I don’t mind dyeing in a Souls game, but when lag keeps killing me, I’m gonna be a bit cross. It’s very odd too, I have a pretty high end PC and can run much, much better looking games on ultra without issue. The early on, supposed to loose fight, bugged out so badly that the thing faded to black before I took any damage. It stayed that way long enough that I thought it had crashed, until I saw the loading symbol… for an uncomfortably long time. That alone would be an issue worth waiting for a patch to buy, but the controls are janky too. There didn’t seem to be analog sensitivity adjustment; so had to keep switching out controllers until I found one that didn’t interrupt me walking across the room in a straight line. How could this have happened, they nailed this before? Yeah, so, the elephant in the room here is Sekiro(not just Sekiro, but we’ll get to that). Traversal, Stealth and combat improvements miles above any of the Souls games were all there, but they ditched them for some reason. I’m not saying we needed a Grappling Hook, but why make the jumps so awkward and imprecise? All the low ledges and walls seem to encourages jumping, but it’s very unclear as to what can be vaulted over. Like Sekiro It does embrace the idea that movement doesn’t consume stamina, sort of. It does when you’re in combat, though that can be somewhat academic due to the poor stealth system and other factors I couldn’t place. Sekiro also nailed parrying, blocking and Dodging. And by that I mean they were balanced enough so that they were all useful. The Perilous Attacks system was a spectacular way to engage foes. Unlike most Soulsborn games you really had to parry. Yet for some reason we are, for the most part, back to Dark Souls 3 style block, dodge and Parries so inexact your better off not bothering. Reviews keep saying it’s a culmination of all From Software has learned, but it’s seems more like a pick-n-mix of middling ideas. Even if you didn’t want to pull from Sekiro for the combat why ignore the other games? The only presence from Dark Souls 2 seems to be the double weapons, nice to have, but hardly that game’s best feature. They seem to keep doing this, Dark Souls was great for it’s time, but Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborn greatly refined the formula. Yet Dark Souls 3 seems to have contained none of what made those games better, and here again. Here as in DS3 we are awash in samey Weapons, I though BB taught you a dozen well designed weapons are better then way, way too many swords. Parrying especially needed to look to these three titles. DS2 made nigh everything Parryable and gave you a big window to counter, BB made parrying at range possible and Sekiro made it fluid enough that it was always a strong option. Here we’re back to DS3’s parrying is here but blocking or dodging is still more viable. In truth this game is proof to me they failed to learn from themselves, but they’re not even looking to what their peers have done. During the Network Tests leveling Strength gave you the ability to wear heavier armor, as in the Nioh games(which let mutable stats dictate this), but they switch it back to only Endurance granting more carry weight. Why? It makes more sense for the Strength based character to have heavier armor. Strength scaling Weapons often have slower windups and longer punishes, as a result you may have to soak a hit to land a blow. It was a good idea; it had been proven to work in other Souls-Like games and they cut it out. On that note, where’s the Rallying system got to? That was such a great feature I’ve seen it crop up in many other games. Is it hidden somewhere in this overstuffed mess? I could go on, I played this game for about five hours and while it felt longer than that, I don’t think I really got anywhere. In point of fact, I think I’ve already gone on too long, but it’s all kind of moot as my primary issue is that; it’s just kinda boring. I mean, haven’t we been here before? I’ve never started a new From Software game and within hour I’m reaching for a podcast. I want more Sekiro, more Bloodborn, heck I’d even take more Dark Souls 2, but just don’t want whatever this is. *Update After many hours I did get into it, the horse combat helped as it is, largely, very fun. But everything comes with a caveat. The mounted sections are good until you get arbitrarily knocked off your alpaca. Now that is admittedly annoying, but what’s worse is there’s nothing you can do about it. There’s no barding you can equip on your beast and while the game says putting points into Dexterity helps keep you from falling off, I’m at 60 Dex and I don’t see much difference. Also, it would only sort of mater if there was a huge difference as you can’t, as far as I can tell, actively do anything to increases your fluffy friends HP. Getting knocked off your horse is often instant death as you just lie on the ground for an age waiting to be mauled. It’s not unlike you’ve had the controller torn from your hand and it is held out of reach until you are ether killed or are obscenely low on health. And just to put a cherry on the alpaca manure Sunday, when your fine beasty does inevitably die, you have to use a health potion to revive them... by way of a menu prompt asking “Are you sure you want to bring your only chance of survival back from the dead at the megger cost of one of your many, easily replenished items?”. Yeah, I’m pretty forking sure Elden Ring, except don’t bother, because I died battling with your superfluous text box, again. Keeping with caveats the bosses are often quite fun, despite their copy paste nature, but some just won’t let up. I’d say learn their pattern, but that only maters if they ever take a break. Dark Souls 2 got critisised for having too many foes per encounter, but I’ll take that over half of them having a HYPER COMBO. By far your best option is to find your favorite utterly broken Spell, Consumable, Ash of War, etc(there’s no shortage) and use it as a crutch when the game decides to change the ru",short didnt realli think everyon clamor ubisoftif dark soul long prosjump buttonmusichors combat mostlyfunaddictiveconsshockingli laggymov jankth world seem emptystamina consumpt feel randomgraph often ugli wash outditch mani better system previou gameswalk back better idea network testsflailingy need wikiwher leg go monitor stop work crash mostli dark soul bigger extra tat tack yet somehow whole thing feel bit cheap big mostli empti open world dodgi travers mechan hour play mostli hide bush collect flower new sneak around fun assassin creed way one camp found enemi tend line site one anoth backstab slow enough leav open littl saw cant realli build charact around stealth long found gatehous archer spot cover boss boss adjac monster realli wont let get away like aforement ubisoft sandbox realli game done favor compar assassin creed often ugli game asset pop creatur disappear color feel wash that uncommon softwar game charact creation screen look like mark improv sadli game model low rez larger one hard corner show limit poli count mani asset seem copi past give whole experi cheap feel help fact prolog slideshow make wonder could caus lag dont mind dye soul game lag keep kill im gon na bit cross odd pretti high end pc run much much better look game ultra without issu earli suppos loos fight bug badli thing fade black took damag stay way long enough thought crash saw load symbol uncomfort long time alon would issu worth wait patch buy control janki didnt seem analog sensit adjust keep switch control found one didnt interrupt walk across room straight line could happen nail yeah eleph room sekironot sekiro well get travers stealth combat improv mile soul game ditch reason im say need grappl hook make jump awkward imprecis low ledg wall seem encourag jump unclear vault like sekiro embrac idea movement doesnt consum stamina sort your combat though somewhat academ due poor stealth system factor couldnt place sekiro also nail parri block dodg mean balanc enough use peril attack system spectacular way engag foe unlik soulsborn game realli parri yet reason part back dark soul style block dodg parri inexact better bother review keep say culmin softwar learn seem like picknmix middl idea even didnt want pull sekiro combat ignor game presenc dark soul seem doubl weapon nice hardli game best featur seem keep dark soul great time dark soul bloodborn greatli refin formula yet dark soul seem contain none made game better awash samey weapon though bb taught dozen well design weapon better way way mani sword parri especi need look three titl made nigh everyth parryabl gave big window counter bb made parri rang possibl sekiro made fluid enough alway strong option back parri block dodg still viabl truth game proof fail learn theyr even look peer done network test level strength gave abil wear heavier armor nioh gameswhich let mutabl stat dictat switch back endur grant carri weight make sens strength base charact heavier armor strength scale weapon often slower windup longer punish result may soak hit land blow good idea proven work soulslik game cut note where ralli system got great featur ive seen crop mani game hidden somewher overstuf mess could go play game five hour felt longer dont think realli got anywher point fact think ive alreadi gone long kind moot primari issu kinda bore mean havent ive never start new softwar game within hour im reach podcast want sekiro bloodborn heck id even take dark soul dont want whatev updat mani hour get hors combat help larg fun everyth come caveat mount section good get arbitrarili knock alpaca admittedli annoy what wors there noth there bard equip beast game say put point dexter help keep fall im dex dont see much differ also would sort mater huge differ cant far tell activ anyth increas fluffi friend hp get knock hors often instant death lie ground age wait maul unlik youv control torn hand held reach ether kill obscen low health put cherri alpaca manur sunday fine beasti inevit die use health potion reviv way menu prompt ask sure want bring chanc surviv back dead megger cost one mani easili replenish item yeah im pretti fork sure elden ring except dont bother die battl superflu text box keep caveat boss often quit fun despit copi past natur wont let id say learn pattern mater ever take break dark soul got critisis mani foe per encount ill take half hyper combo far best option find favorit utterli broken spell consum ash war etcther shortag use crutch game decid chang ru

There are of course early bugs and optimization issues but I have full confidence CA will address every single one of these and the game will be polished in short order due to CA's record of interaction and communication with the fans.

"2022 I can now confidently recommend Warhammer III.The release of Immortal Empires has reduced many of the issues with the Realm of Chaos campaign and the newly added factions and lords have a significantly improved Realm of Chaos experience. That said, it's still unfortunate that the base game factions have such a disappointment Realm of Chaos experience and I'd like to see more iteration on that front, though I suspect this will have to wait until future lord releases for each faction.The game still has many bugs, but they are much less of an issue than before. Settlement battles still have significant issues, but a reduction in the sizes of garrisons combined with the removal of minor settlement battles in most situations has made this a relatively minor irritation. That said, this is still an area that Creative Assembly needs to address at some point. The Immortal Empires experience brings Warhammer III up to the quality of Warhammer II. It should be noted this is over a year from when the game initially launched, which is a significant problem. It should also be noted that the team responsible for the initial Warhammer III experience is separate from the team that has made the most progress in bringing the game up to par. I find this a little concerning for future titles, but it does mean that Warhammer III is in great hands.The Warriors of Chaos DLC was a fantastic addition to the game, creating new mechanics that open up exciting possibilities for future revamps and future titles from Creative Assembly. I didn't think it was possible, but the Chaos Dwarf DLC is also an expansion of mechanics that expands the horizon for what's possible in a Total War game. It's a little expensive, but it is the most well developed faction added to the Total War Warhammer franchise to date across all 3 titles.The game is in a really solid space right now and I think there's a lot to look forward to in the future.",confid recommend warhamm iiith releas immort empir reduc mani issu realm chao campaign newli ad faction lord significantli improv realm chao experi said still unfortun base game faction disappoint realm chao experi id like see iter front though suspect wait futur lord releas factionth game still mani bug much less issu settlement battl still signific issu reduct size garrison combin remov minor settlement battl situat made rel minor irrit said still area creativ assembl need address point immort empir experi bring warhamm iii qualiti warhamm ii note year game initi launch signific problem also note team respons initi warhamm iii experi separ team made progress bring game par find littl concern futur titl mean warhamm iii great handsth warrior chao dlc fantast addit game creat new mechan open excit possibl futur revamp futur titl creativ assembl didnt think possibl chao dwarf dlc also expans mechan expand horizon what possibl total war game littl expens well develop faction ad total war warhamm franchis date across titlesth game realli solid space right think there lot look forward futur

"2022 As probably many have said before me, this game was not, and is still not, in a fit state to launch.Whilst some head-scratching design choices for the campaign will hopefully be eliminated with the introduction of the ""Immortal Empires"", the problem with the game runs far deeper.Units are unresponsive (even after the ""massive update"" released a few weeks back), and will often run in a completely different direction to the one ordered - this is extremely visible on the new (and, imo, not very enjoyable) settlement battles, where the map designers don't seem to have ever played a game of total war before, but can also happen on an open map, where a unit will walk in the wrong direction and then refuse to move or take any orders for the rest of the battle.Also, missile units will often not fire when enemy units are in range, would randomly swap target from the order given.The fact the game was released in this state shows an utter contempt for the consumer.I have a general rule of never pre-ordering, which I've broken twice recently. And both times (this game and cyberpunk), I've been reminded that you can't trust that a developer's previous work will be any indication of a future product.

"At first when I saw the trailer to the game, I thought that Space Marine 2 looked like an amazing game, but due to the track record of modern games being released broken, I was extremely hesitant to pre-ordering the game, however, the more and more I looked at it and heard more and more conversations about it, it wasn't until Sept. 3rd that I finally succumbed to finally pre-ordering the Ultra Edition just so that I could experience the game for myself and not worry about what others tell me. Go big or go home, right?Space Marine 2 was the best pre-order I could have ever spent my money on. Even though this is a pre-release review, and there are some minor bugs here and there, Sabre still has time to polish whatever minor bugs there are before the 9th when the game is fully released.As is now, Space Marine 2 feels like a 1.0 game even during the pre-release. Every 1.0 game known to man has always had it's fair share of minor bugs, and so does this game, but they're only minor at best. No game breaking bugs, or anything! I can absolutely say that this game is a solid 10/10 no matter how I look at it.

"2022 Builds upon the formula of Dark Souls III with new ways to approach combat such as sneaking, jumping, and mounted combat. The world is huge, with lots of interesting enemies and NPCs to encounter. Replay value will likely be a strong point for this game as there are plenty of new spells and weapons. Some animations and assets have been recycled from previous games, but there is enough new stuff to make it feel like a new experience. Performance can be rough at times, though the team has been rolling out patches to mitigate these issues. Co-op seems to be basically copied from Dark Souls III, except the item used to host a session is much easier to obtain. I'd really like to see them make some design improvements allowing for players to co-op in an area even after the boss has been defeated, similar to the small white soapstone in Dark Souls II. Overall, I've had a lot of fun with the game so far, and expect to experiment with new builds in New Game+ for many hours.",build upon formula dark soul iii new way approach combat sneak jump mount combat world huge lot interest enemi npc encount replay valu like strong point game plenti new spell weapon anim asset recycl previou game enough new stuff make feel like new experi perform rough time though team roll patch mitig issu coop seem basic copi dark soul iii except item use host session much easier obtain id realli like see make design improv allow player coop area even boss defeat similar small white soapston dark soul ii overal ive lot fun game far expect experi new build new game mani hour

"Fantastic Combat Variety with Improved AI (Updated)Space Marines 2 excels in both ranged and melee combat. The game offers a vast array of guns with tons of customization options, allowing you to create unique gun builds to suit your playstyle—yes, there are actual gun builds! This variety, combined with smooth shooting mechanics, adds a lot of depth and fun to combat, keeping things fresh as you tweak and experiment with your loadouts.The melee combat is equally impressive. The game features three distinct types of defense: Block, Balanced, and Fencing. Blocking lets you absorb damage but doesn’t allow for parrying. Balanced offers a mix of blocking and parrying, while Fencing skips blocking altogether, giving you a larger window for perfect parries. Mastering these systems, especially Balanced or Fencing, turns you into a true killing machine in close quarters.The game also shines in its horde-style combat. You'll face a wide variety of enemy types, each with their own fighting style. For example, you might find yourself swarmed by small minions while an elite enemy locks onto you. This adds layers of strategy and intensity. The health system might seem a bit confusing at first, but it consists of both actual character health, which can be lost, and ""Contested"" health, represented by a white bar. To regain health, you have to fight over this contested health, which can deplete quickly or slowly depending on the situation. You'll also unlock skills that not only enhance your abilities but also provide buffs for your team.While the game is on the shorter side, clocking in at around 7-12 hours depending on your difficulty setting, it’s still a blast to play. The AI has improved significantly, with your teammates now fighting properly and no longer being ignored by the enemy. They’ll also prioritize reviving you when you’re downed, adding more balance to solo play.Overall, Space Marines 2 is excellent, and I hope the devs continue to update and add more content. I’d love to see them take a page from Darktide and make the missions and customization feel more fleshed out.",fantast combat varieti improv ai updatedspac marin excel rang mele combat game offer vast array gun ton custom option allow creat uniqu gun build suit playstyley actual gun build varieti combin smooth shoot mechan add lot depth fun combat keep thing fresh tweak experi loadoutsth mele combat equal impress game featur three distinct type defens block balanc fenc block let absorb damag doesnt allow parri balanc offer mix block parri fenc skip block altogeth give larger window perfect parri master system especi balanc fenc turn true kill machin close quartersth game also shine hordestyl combat youll face wide varieti enemi type fight style exampl might find swarm small minion elit enemi lock onto add layer strategi intens health system might seem bit confus first consist actual charact health lost contest health repres white bar regain health fight contest health deplet quickli slowli depend situat youll also unlock skill enhanc abil also provid buff teamwhil game shorter side clock around hour depend difficulti set still blast play ai improv significantli teammat fight properli longer ignor enemi theyll also priorit reviv your down ad balanc solo playoveral space marin excel hope dev continu updat add content id love see take page darktid make mission custom feel flesh

"The Warhammer Game We Have Been Waiting For. But, Space Marine 2 is an amazing game and excellent entry to the Warhammer 40k series. Most of us know that GOOD Warhammer games are hard to come by. Many games were hit and miss & eventually faded away to time. But, this entry to the series in my honest opinion is going to be what puts this amazing series on the map more than ever. New and Seasoned fans are going to be in for a delight as they mow their way through the Tyranid filth & Expel the heretical chaos cults. It has been so long since we felt this way. Warhammer fans rejoice. This game offers something to scratch the needs of almost all players. Looking for a campaign? We got it . Looking for a PVE co-op experience? We got it . Looking for a PVP experience? We got it . Rejoice! Games Workshop finally did something good! Took them a while if you ask me. Huge shout-out to saber. Now for the heresy. As good as the game is. It is far from perfect, this game has a lot of inconsistencies and missing features that I would've not come to expect in a title such as this. So I will try my best to break it down & be honest. ( I am a long time warhammer fan ) for reference. The Campaign The campaign is good but, its not great. It feels like they wanted to combine God Of War & Dark-tide. But ultimately it fell a tad short based on my opinion. For such a series packed to the BRIM with lore and amazing characters. I felt like a-lot was missing from the experience. The voice-acting felt a bit complacent and dull. Some moments where good, some moments where bad. Overall I felt a inconsistent experience. A-lot of the WOW factor starts to wear off pretty quickly. Once you experience it a few times. It starts losing its touch real fast. The Co-op Now Space Marine 2 has two different co-op experiences that it can offer. The co-op campaign & the operations mode. The Co-op campaign is as much as you'd expect from this game. Its fun, moderately paced & great with friends. Operations mode feels like it lacks quite a-lot of repeatability. Every mission is the same with the only change being where you grab an objective off a corpse. There is no ""modifiers"" or anything else that you can think of to keep a fresh experience or, a less bland one. The only variation you get is your classes and armors. That's all. To me, thats a HUGE let-down. Warhammer: Dark-tide offers more variation in one mission then all the operation missions do combined. Thats a big oof if you ask me. I don't ever really feel like running those missions more than once its really worth my time as it becomes boring and repetitive quite quickly. Truly is a shame as I feel like the selling point for this game was its operations mode. The Versus Mode Ok, if you're looking for call of duty, wrong game. If you're looking for Counter Strike, wrong game. If you're looking for laggy servers, unbalanced classes, unbalanced weapons & bugged multiplayer search lobbies. You're in the right place. The versus mode in this game is heresy. It is the work of a champion of chaos. It is totally a mess, borderline unplayable and just not fun at all. The entire versus experience feels rushed and un-polished. Why is a bulwark in my lobby tanking bullets from 5 different marines shooting directly at him? No idea. But, i don't think that's good design in a PVP scenario. Why does sniper deal almost no damage? No idea. Why would anyone even try to play the jetpack marine just to get instantly shot out of the sky? No idea. all in all, the versus is actually the worst part of the game. I can not recommend against it enough. It is really the worst part to this game and feels rushed and an absolute joke to say the least about it. Don't play it. The servers are horrible, the weapons are unbalanced and frankly some classes just don't belong there. PLEASE DO NOT PLAY IT FOR YOUR SAKE LOL. Achievements Why is there no achievement for beating the game on Angel Of Death. Do you know hard that is. And you mean to tell me there is no recognition for it? Nice. All in all its a great game. Most definitely the one of the best in the series since Soulstorm, Dark crusade, Vermentide, Dark-tide. But, if you payed $89 or $100 for this game. You 100% just got scammed for the lack of content and replayability this game currently offers. I really hope this game gets more and more beef on its bones as time moves on but for now. Get ready for an experience you're only going to feel one time and never come back to again because there is nothing to keep you playing.

"The game itself is nothing unique, but its done so well that it feels like it is. I was having fun with the game right away, but really when i hit chapter 2 i was freaking hooked. Something about the lore, the story telling, the relatively deep RPG elements, the combat - it just feels so damn fun to play. Im half way through the game at the time of writing this review, but its just so much fun i had to add to the good vibes online for the game.

"2022 Quick summary first I've played every game from Fromsoft starting with dark souls and I view BB as the best, I have roughly 1400 hours across the series and have done everything in this game. Elden Ring fails as a souls game and it is with this opinion I would not recommend, despite that it could be a great open-world game. it has fantastic visuals and the world is interesting (sometimes) but it has awful repetitive bosses, copy-pasted enemies with different coats of paint, zero direction for the player, a useless crafting system and unrewarding exploration.The story is easily missable as the exposition dump character only appears at certain graces and only if you notice the talk to her button appeared. I normally don't have an issue with the story in these games as the environment and item descriptions do the telling but not knowing why I need to become the Elden lord or how the world got the way it did kinda sapped my motivation which consisted of exploring and find a new thing. From what I can tell its the same thing as dark souls with fire being integral, big trees, and really boring naming convention (Eld, Erd, every name starts with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ M. Seriously we have Marika, Mohg, Mohgwyn, Malenia, Melina, Miquela, Millicent, Miriel) and runes instead of souls.Not having a scooby where to go is par for the course with the series but is exponentially worse with the open-world as the graces only point towards the nearest lord, not the medallion you might need, some legacy dungeons are horrific Stormveil comes to mind, I couldn't imagine being a new player and experiencing that fresh hell as the game encourages you to go there first instead of the nice southern area to get +3 tears, having three secret areas within itself is some dumb design the consecrated snowfields, the Haligtree and the blood area can be missed despite the fact they each hold one of the lord bosses that drops a great rune.The reward for exploring is pitiful see that item behind the illusionary wall and protected by a hard mob? It's a crafting flower that has an infinite respawn area. You just killed a hard boss? Useless ash summon for you. 90% of the armour I had was farmed by enemies or bought from merchants.I honestly think dark souls 2 has a better enemy variety which was lambasted as ""dudes in armour"", in this game when I go to a different area it is the exact same knights and footsoldiers in different coloured armour and composition of allies. I get that some enemies have to be reused but seriously I should not see them in every area, oh and some reskinned mobs from previous games make a visit like the demi-humans are reskinned monkeys from Sekiro.The world looks phenomenal especially the underground environments like Nokron despite some goofy stuff that might be a reference but takes me out of it like the Nights Cavalry aka Nazgul, Godfrey Joestar, Blaidd who is literally guts.The crafting system brings nothing of value to the formula, I think I crafted one stack of arrows and an item discovery boost as arrows can be bought and are of better quality, buildup resist items were never necessary, firebombs and the myriad of variants were borderline useless as hitting the thing with a stick is quicker and less likely to get you punished for missing. Usable items only challenge runs should be more interesting now.The bosses are horrific, there are multiple slightly beefed up mobs with a health bar and name, gank fights happen too often to artificially pump up the difficulty, some bosses are too big for their arenas so you fight the camera (tree spirits suck), some can fly so high you can't see them so dragons consist of ""please dive bomb me, don't breathe fire"". Most unique bosses have fast high damage attacks, glue-like tracking, multiple distance closing attacks, most standard attacks have AOE effects (think twin princes overhead from DS3 or Lawrence from BB), some form of delayed attack like the nameless king. Now can you see the issue? Bosses went from most of the time playing on similar rules as the player as big weapon = long reach + big damage - slow even Bloodborne to a lesser extent understood this like Ludwig, AOE attacks used to be limited to 1 attack that had an easy tell, a fast backhand attack would do little damage but now borderline one taps even if you overleveled vigour. Not a single boss was enjoyable no memorable greats like O&S, Artorias, Gwyn, Maria or Friede, Gael, Soul of Cinder, Genchiro, Fume Knight, Ludwig. I went through this game praying for a good boss and the closest I got was Malenia who while fast and stupidly hard-hitting felt fair until she spammed one bs attack, killing her was pure luck that she never used that move. Every other souls game I looked forward to the next boss and learning the fight like a dance, now it was sheer dread as to what flavour of Lawrence will kill me this time? With Bloodborne being my favourite game high speed gameplay is what I love but this game suffers for it as you don't have the mobility to keep up with the bosses.Apparently, the optimisation is also rubbish worked fine with me but your mileage may vary.This game was not meant for solo players it was very clearly designed around co-op and spamming ash summons which goes against everything I knew about the series. I honestly do not want to play it again unlike the others where I was excited for NG+. Now because I went against the almighty Miyazaki I expect to see a shill in the comments hitting me with ""git gud"" or ""you have x hours how can you not recommend"" please do not disappoint me.",quick summari first ive play everi game fromsoft start dark soul view bb best roughli hour across seri done everyth game elden ring fail soul game opinion would recommend despit could great openworld game fantast visual world interest sometim aw repetit boss copypast enemi differ coat paint zero direct player useless craft system unreward explorationth stori easili missabl exposit dump charact appear certain grace notic talk button appear normal dont issu stori game environ item descript tell know need becom elden lord world got way kinda sap motiv consist explor find new thing tell thing dark soul fire integr big tree realli bore name convent eld erd everi name start serious marika mohg mohgwyn malenia melina miquela millic miriel rune instead soulsnot scoobi go par cours seri exponenti wors openworld grace point toward nearest lord medallion might need legaci dungeon horrif stormveil come mind couldnt imagin new player experienc fresh hell game encourag go first instead nice southern area get tear three secret area within dumb design consecr snowfield haligtre blood area miss despit fact hold one lord boss drop great runeth reward explor piti see item behind illusionari wall protect hard mob craft flower infinit respawn area kill hard boss useless ash summon armour farm enemi bought merchantsi honestli think dark soul better enemi varieti lambast dude armour game go differ area exact knight footsoldi differ colour armour composit alli get enemi reus serious see everi area oh reskin mob previou game make visit like demihuman reskin monkey sekiroth world look phenomen especi underground environ like nokron despit goofi stuff might refer take like night cavalri aka nazgul godfrey joestar blaidd liter gutsth craft system bring noth valu formula think craft one stack arrow item discoveri boost arrow bought better qualiti buildup resist item never necessari firebomb myriad variant borderlin useless hit thing stick quicker less like get punish miss usabl item challeng run interest nowth boss horrif multipl slightli beef mob health bar name gank fight happen often artifici pump difficulti boss big arena fight camera tree spirit suck fli high cant see dragon consist pleas dive bomb dont breath fire uniqu boss fast high damag attack gluelik track multipl distanc close attack standard attack aoe effect think twin princ overhead lawrenc bb form delay attack like nameless king see issu boss went time play similar rule player big weapon long reach big damag slow even bloodborn lesser extent understood like ludwig aoe attack use limit attack easi tell fast backhand attack would littl damag borderlin one tap even overlevel vigour singl boss enjoy memor great like os artoria gwyn maria fried gael soul cinder genchiro fume knight ludwig went game pray good boss closest got malenia fast stupidli hardhit felt fair spam one bs attack kill pure luck never use move everi soul game look forward next boss learn fight like danc sheer dread flavour lawrenc kill time bloodborn favourit game high speed gameplay love game suffer dont mobil keep bossesappar optimis also rubbish work fine mileag may varythi game meant solo player clearli design around coop spam ash summon goe everyth knew seri honestli want play unlik other excit ng went almighti miyazaki expect see shill comment hit git gud x hour recommend pleas disappoint

You can call me ""bad"" ""Terrible"" ""They're just better"" But iv been playing since 2013, I know who is legit and who is blatantly cheating.Project A will not kill csgo, Its very different, looks more like overwatch. Im not afraid of csgo dying, but what i am worried about is new players dealing with cheating, Getting annoyed and then cheat themselves. This is why there are so many cheaters. VAC is not a good anti cheat.I do not recommend buying prime unless your willing to deal with 5 days of cheaters, then hopefully having a good trust factor where there are no cheaters.Valve, You should really implement a trust factor XP bar, or something so you can tell if yours is good or not. The current system is broken, You sometimes have cheaters with new accounts, and sometimes 5 year old players who are obviously not cheating. The current system is broken and needs to be fixed.If you still sit here and think this is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, ill link a video soon, I bought a new account, and played 1 game, All good no cheaters, Played another one. Spinbotters who crash the server so they dont get Overwatched because it corrupts the demo. I have proof for all of this.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Initial Review Counterstrike is and always will be a amazing game. The reason its having its downfalls is due to the 78% of the community uses cheats. VAC is the WORST anti cheat there is out there, This is something a 12 year old could bypass in his computer class at school. You can code walls in less than 1 hour. Theres nothing protecting this game!!!!VALVE project A will DESTROY CSGO if you do not implement another anti cheat. EAC is better than this garbage.Honestly dont waste your money on this game if you have no trust factor or low, Queing with people who have Low Trustfactor is the worst thing you can do. Its all cheaters who HVH in MM. I suggest removing Trust Factor or fix it. I que with someone who gets a 7 day due to kicking players who ♥♥♥♥ around in comp then he has Low Trust Factor, Then we que with hackers.Please for ♥♥♥♥ Sakes valve fix your game. Remove these scums so us LEGIT old players actually have a fun time instead of leaving this game..THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH PURCHASING DO NOT PLAY IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE GOOD TRUST FACTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",chang opinion game expect review blow muchth day wrote gotten game hacker enemi team guy spin bot call bad terribl theyr better iv play sinc know legit blatantli cheatingproject kill csgo differ look like overwatch im afraid csgo die worri new player deal cheat get annoy cheat mani cheater vac good anti cheati recommend buy prime unless will deal day cheater hope good trust factor cheatersvalv realli implement trust factor xp bar someth tell good current system broken sometim cheater new account sometim year old player obvious cheat current system broken need fixedif still sit think ill link video soon bought new account play game good cheater play anoth one spinbott crash server dont get overwatch corrupt demo proof thisiniti review counterstrik alway amaz game reason downfal due commun use cheat vac worst anti cheat someth year old could bypass comput class school code wall less hour there noth protect gamevalv project destroy csgo implement anoth anti cheat eac better garbagehonestli dont wast money game trust factor low que peopl low trustfactor worst thing cheater hvh mm suggest remov trust factor fix que someon get day due kick player around comp low trust factor que hackerspleas sake valv fix game remov scum us legit old player actual fun time instead leav gamethi game worth purchas play alreadi good trust factor
"2022 PrefaceElden Ring marks two occasions that are worth mentioning. First, I will be changing my review format from this point on, as the previous format I've used for the last two years does not do games of this caliber justice. Second, Elden Ring has arguably been a firm reminder to gamers of past, present, and future generations that a Renaissance of sorts is long overdue in the gaming industry. Plagued by predatory practices by AAA companies marked by endless greed and exploitation of the general public, the gaming industry as it stands today has been decaying since the late 2000s. I believe Elden Ring, along with a handful of other games, has begun to slowly but surely lead us into another golden era of gaming, which we need now more than ever.Note: Although I 100%-ed the game (in terms of achievements) on my main character within roughly 82 hours, this review was delayed because I wanted to see at least 4 other classes/builds to truly see all that the game has to offer.PositivesBest Open World to DATE- No loading screens, vast world to explore without disruption, and most importantly all executed with ZERO bugs. The moment I walk into certain areas and come to the realization of how big the world actually is, I find myself in awe every few hours. Genuine WTF momentsClass balance- Versatile and large number of classes to choose from, but without any hard restrictions so that players can engage the world however they see fit with appropriate attribute allocation, spell memories, ash of war loadouts, and equipment.Mounted CombatI never thought mounted combat would ever feel better than when I played Witcher 3, but Elden Ring has taken it to another level. Feels so good to just drag around the Zweihander across the ground and throw enemies into the air.Attention to Detail- Many open world games like to disguise themselves as detail-oriented, but Elden Ring has set a new bar. Every nook and cranny is accessible, only invisible walls are locked behind Stone Keys unlike other games that ""block you out"" for no reason.Open Exploration & QuestingWe've all most likely heard the news about other open-world game devs throwing shade at Elden Ring for not spoon-feeding the players, but I'm definitely on the side that supports Elden Ring's breaking of the status quo. Freedom to explore and right to choose are fundamental factors that make the experience unique and memorable. Companies like Ubisoft have gotten far too content with their design tendencies.DifficultyThis one is the big one. Elden Ring has virtually perfected the art of allowing players to literally choose how difficult the game becomes, from a scale of 0-100. It's such an ingenious move to say ""Hey, here's the first story boss. Either go as you are now with starting gear or come back after clearing some dungeons and beefing yourself up a bit."" How can you complain about a lack of easy mode at that point?NegativesStorytelling & Lore ExpositionI only have one minor nitpick and this one is most certainly arguable. Personally I find that the FromSoftware games have become more and more vague with their storytelling. This is a different field from my praising their open exploration design. Not to say the lore is bad and I understand to some extent that they like to leave things to open interpretation, but I just wish that they would be a little more revealing in terms of exposing the players to what's going on as they play. There are players like us who are used to interpreting events based on what NPCs tell us with their vague dialogue, but most players (especially those who are new to the Souls-like games) are not too keen on deciphering the story bit by bit. The FromSoftware games are the games that desperately need a Encyclopedia section in the main menu.ConclusionFinal Verdict: S+ 10/10All in all, Elden Ring is a grand masterpiece that justly deserves all the praise. Game of the year. Game of the decade. Let's hope many other companies follow suit.

"2022 UPDATED 8-22: I've been waiting to flip my negative review for a while now. Immortal Empires has turned the ho-hum campaign into the planetwide bloodbath it was meant to be. They've polished up the performance and in two campaigns I've had one crash. Just one. It looks good, it plays good, CA is still dropping content. Did I mention there's something like 280 other nations in game now?First the good - graphics are great and sound design are all top notch, as we all knew they would be. The new map is beautiful, the Chaos Wastes and some of the associated mechanics are interesting. Now time to get past the ego-stroke reviews the media gave this because that's really all the good there is.The new siege mechanics are a nightmare. The old way might have been a slog but instead of just updating city maps (which they did, and they look great) they've added a supply system that lets the defenders build defenses and reinforce units almost indefinitely. Every battle in a walled settlement is now one of those 1990's RTS missions no one likes where one side gets a handful of units while the other gets a fully functional fortress and economy.The campaign is another gimmicky armies-spawning-everywhere-inside-your-borders scenario and some of the battles are just wave after wave of enemies from all sides. I have 2000 hours in Warhammer 2, I struggled to finish the campaign with Kislev on normal. Not one of those good struggles, it's more like passing a kidney stone. I would rather slam my sack in a door than try this on hard+.Hopefully they add the huge Mortal Empires style world map soon. None of the factions from 1&2 are playable in 3 so it's a giant step backward in terms of content. The devs have some work to do, otherwise I'm hopeful a good modder comes along disables all of this siege junk and keeps the new maps and factions.",updat ive wait flip neg review immort empir turn hohum campaign planetwid bloodbath meant theyv polish perform two campaign ive one crash one look good play good ca still drop content mention there someth like nation game nowfirst good graphic great sound design top notch knew would new map beauti chao wast associ mechan interest time get past egostrok review media gave that realli good isth new sieg mechan nightmar old way might slog instead updat citi map look great theyv ad suppli system let defend build defens reinforc unit almost indefinit everi battl wall settlement one rt mission one like one side get hand unit get fulli function fortress economyth campaign anoth gimmicki armiesspawningeverywhereinsideyourbord scenario battl wave wave enemi side hour warhamm struggl finish campaign kislev normal one good struggl like pass kidney stone would rather slam sack door tri hardhop add huge mortal empir style world map soon none faction playabl giant step backward term content dev work otherwis im hope good modder come along disabl sieg junk keep new map faction

With matchmaking they made it easy to play the game the way it's supposed to be played - in a competitive 5v5. There's also a lot of casual modes, like deathmatch and battle royale.

"2013 Global Offensive is a new addition to the Counter Strike series. This game features a unique tactical gameplay with 2 teams.-The Counter Terrorists (CT's): Anti - Terrorist group from over the world. SAS, SWAT, FBI and the Israel Defense Force. Their objective is to rescue hostages in (cs_) maps or in (de_) maps to defend a bombsite from the terrorists.- The Terrorists (T's): Terrorists are the bad guys. They need to defend hostages from being rescued from the CT's or need to bomb bombsites that the CT's must defend.Ofcourse this Counter Strike feature new and the classic maps like de_nuke and one of the best maps : de_dust2 and also features new gamemodes like: -Arms Race an official version of one of the most populair mod gun game. Where people need to make kills with all weapons given. The first one to get a kill with the ""golden knife"" wins-Demolition a all new gamemode with elements of Arms Race within small demolition maps where T's need to bomb the bombsite.-Deathmatch a deathmatch on Counter Strike maps with the idea of the chaos from game like Quake 3.This game is for everyone. From Counter Strike veterans to people that are new to FPS's altough it can be hard to get started.In my opinion the best thing they added to Counter Strike is the Competetive modes. Counter Strike always was one of the most competetive games ever but you needed to find matches and a team on chatrooms like IRC, Quakenet and those sort of things. Now it doesnt matter if you have a full team or your on your one. You can always find matches like this. This is just the normal Counter Strike maps. But the gameplay changes drastically. This is a dead serious mode so this is not somewhere where you should grief or ♥♥♥♥ around. This is a COMPETETIVE mode. People want to COMPETE. Prepare for battle. However you don't need to be the best in Counter Strike to play competetive mode. After 10 wins you will be set in a skill group. To this skill group you will be matched to people with almost the same skill. So you don't have to worry.The new Arms Deal update provided us with many new skins for you guns. This is a great addition. You can buy and or get weapons for free by playing the game.Also new in this series is temporary map packs like the Operation Payback and the Operation Bravo. This is a mappack that you can pickup for 5 euró's that feature the most liked custom maps on official Valve servers. No lagg and your favorite maps on stable servers.My opinion about Global Offensive is that it is the best Counter Strike. I started playing Counter Strike Source 5 years ago. I loved the gameplay and the tactics. Then Global Offensive came out and i was tought this wasn't gonna be a good game. But it proven itself. Valve did a great job with this game. Most of the things i missed on Source are there in Global Offensive. For example the competetive mode i explained before.",global offens new addit counter strike seri game featur uniqu tactic gameplay teamsth counter terrorist ct anti terrorist group world sa swat fbi israel defens forc object rescu hostag cs map de map defend bombsit terrorist terrorist ts terrorist bad guy need defend hostag rescu ct need bomb bombsit ct must defendofcours counter strike featur new classic map like denuk one best map also featur new gamemod like arm race offici version one populair mod gun game peopl need make kill weapon given first one get kill golden knife winsdemolit new gamemod element arm race within small demolit map ts need bomb bombsitedeathmatch deathmatch counter strike map idea chao game like quak game everyon counter strike veteran peopl new fpss altough hard get startedin opinion best thing ad counter strike competet mode counter strike alway one competet game ever need find match team chatroom like irc quakenet sort thing doesnt matter full team one alway find match like normal counter strike map gameplay chang drastic dead seriou mode somewher grief around competet mode peopl want compet prepar battl howev dont need best counter strike play competet mode win set skill group skill group match peopl almost skill dont worryth new arm deal updat provid us mani new skin gun great addit buy get weapon free play gamealso new seri temporari map pack like oper payback oper bravo mappack pickup eur featur like custom map offici valv server lagg favorit map stabl serversmi opinion global offens best counter strike start play counter strike sourc year ago love gameplay tactic global offens came tought wasnt gon na good game proven valv great job game thing miss sourc global offens exampl competet mode explain

"2023 Game has been completely ruined and it has nothing to do with the bugs etc, tbh it looks and plays great it is a decent successor to cs-go once you iron out the kinks.. However, the cheaters... premier matchmaking... faceit... You decided to break all of it, the entire game. Vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn, through walls, whilst bhopping... cheaters can do things they couldn't do in CSGO..... Fine at least we could play faceit on the 128 tick servers you once assured us we would get. Oh look nope, you hardcode subtick.. even though 128 was proven to be working better. Oh well lets go play csgo oh no we cant do that either... Then there is the false bans (I was one of them, the one you caused with your own update. It was promptly removed and i am grateful but no compensation, not a word to the community just silence... Ok well lets set that all aside and move on... oh we can't because then there is the exploits, I have never in my life wondered if was safe to play a game... You are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters, without any active client sided anticheat, serverside plugins, fog of war. You don't punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves, you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards. There are more cheaters than pros now...and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field, we would all get a fair chance to compete. Counter Strike is for everyone... Counter Strike is dying and you guys shot it. I love counter strike, it was the first game I played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid, I lost entire summers to this. You guys as a Dev team and company have lost respect for your player base and your own game. You throw us in the bin and at the same time you flex an incoming ''major''. You might need to climb off your high horses, play your own game with us, talk to the community a little. Actually respond to feedback. Counter Strike has one of the most dedicated communities and I am sure if you paid even a fraction of it back to us that investment would pay off ten fold for you guys.",game complet ruin noth bug etc tbh look play great decent successor csgo iron kink howev cheater premier matchmak faceit decid break entir game vac live non exist peopl kill spawn wall whilst bhop cheater thing couldnt csgo fine least could play faceit tick server assur us would get oh look nope hardcod subtick even though proven work better oh well let go play csgo oh cant either fals ban one one caus updat promptli remov grate compens word commun silenc ok well let set asid move oh cant exploit never life wonder safe play game forc player base play unpolish game cheater without activ client side anticheat serversid plugin fog war dont punish peopl boost cheater even cheat selv allow flex brag publicli leader board cheater pro nowand suppos game level play field would get fair chanc compet counter strike everyon counter strike die guy shot love counter strike first game play uncl internet cafe littl kid lost entir summer guy dev team compani lost respect player base game throw us bin time flex incom major might need climb high hors play game us talk commun littl actual respond feedback counter strike one dedic commun sure paid even fraction back us invest would pay ten fold guy

Every fix I have seen from people online has not worked. I have been playing with invisible enemies, 20fps, frame drops ON TOP OF the previous low fps. And today's update has made it worse. I cannot in good conscience give this great game a positive review until the issues with the port are fixed. By all means, purchase the game and you have no issues, keep playing, but anything less than that deserves an immediate refund.",edit billion set chang updat game run like dream dont understand dont want understand im gon na go enjoy land play game nowy review neg ye game time write ye game incred port terribl ram nvidia super gpu cpu everyth uptod driver shader cach set unlimit everi fix seen peopl onlin work play invis enemi frame drop top previou low fp today updat made wors good conscienc give great game posit review issu port fix mean purchas game issu keep play anyth less deserv immedi refund

"One of the best adventure games everDevelopers had an advantage of taking a very well developed world and one of the most famous story in it. And they not only took it but they delivered on it. Game has wide variety of enemies each of them has it's own backstory (obviously taken from chinese folklore but still) which slightly enlarge our understanding of the world. And just this world and story is enough to give this game a try even if you are not a fan of any other aspects of the game.Game consists of 6 chapters each of which has it's unique enemy cast (with exception of ch5) and corresponding bosses. I remember entering ch5 and my thought ""lol those enemies are just reskins of earlier ones lazy devs"". But in any other game I would just perceive this as a norm and the fact that I perceived this as a minus speaks very highly about enemy variety in the game.Bosses divides in two parts - chiefs and kings. Difficulty-wise they are mixed up, kings just have more shiny moves I guess...Bosses in a vacuum are all awesome - they has their place in the world, they has a backstory, they have cool moves and good loot. Also they are balanced pretty good for an adventure game even tho I wish they was harder cos amount of bosses I just first try facetanked is unhealthy in my opinion. On the other hand I heard that some people struggles a lot on different bosses so my opinion is not objective here. And yes, I also struggled on those two bosses :)Maps are also awesome - with unique biomes and gorgeous views. They are normal adventure type maps with branching path to the end boss. But game doesn't have any map in menu so navigating and finding all secrets can be quite time consuming (especially in ch3).Chapter 6 map is failed (in my opinion) experiment on openworld type of map. There is literally nothing in it except for a few bad bosses and 1 (one!) chest.Why ch6 bosses are bad? I hate 2 types of bosses: ""puzzle"" boss and ""catch me ♥♥♥♥♥"" boss. They are like 90% of ch6 bosses :(But game is not without technical problems of courseFirst of all - camera. Camera can get behind a tree or a wall which is annoying. Also camera tracking is quite loose so if you move around around the boss too much or if boss is has very mobile moveset - he will be out of your field view for a good 30+% of a fight. Also you can just lose target lock during some of boss moves if you don't manually readjust camera during fight (which is annoying if you use gamepad).Minor problem with inputs - for example run button won't register if you pressed it before your run-prohibiting move ends.And annoying problem with lack of target tracking. Like you know how lazy boss designers adds insane target tracking to all moves of bosses - here designers went deeper - heavy attack after roll in 75% of cases will just miss the mark completely - it's not hitting where enemy was, nor where he is going, just some random particle in the air, which is extremely frustrating after you spent like a minute to charge this attack.But despite these problems game is still awesome, bosses are still very manageable due to variety of builds (and ability to redo your build at any time).Solid 9/10",one best adventur game everdevelop advantag take well develop world one famou stori took deliv game wide varieti enemi backstori obvious taken chines folklor still slightli enlarg understand world world stori enough give game tri even fan aspect gamegam consist chapter uniqu enemi cast except correspond boss rememb enter thought lol enemi reskin earlier one lazi dev game would perceiv norm fact perceiv minu speak highli enemi varieti gameboss divid two part chief king difficultywis mix king shini move guessboss vacuum awesom place world backstori cool move good loot also balanc pretti good adventur game even tho wish harder co amount boss first tri facetank unhealthi opinion hand heard peopl struggl lot differ boss opinion object ye also struggl two boss map also awesom uniqu biom gorgeou view normal adventur type map branch path end boss game doesnt map menu navig find secret quit time consum especi map fail opinion experi openworld type map liter noth except bad boss one chestwhi boss bad hate type boss puzzl boss catch boss like boss game without technic problem coursefirst camera camera get behind tree wall annoy also camera track quit loos move around around boss much boss mobil moveset field view good fight also lose target lock boss move dont manual readjust camera fight annoy use gamepadminor problem input exampl run button wont regist press runprohibit move endsand annoy problem lack target track like know lazi boss design add insan target track move boss design went deeper heavi attack roll case miss mark complet hit enemi go random particl air extrem frustrat spent like minut charg attackbut despit problem game still awesom boss still manag due varieti build abil redo build timesolid

"2022 The writing on the tin says ""Dark Souls, but open world"". And you get exactly what it says on that tin, give or take a few quirks. And it's a rare case of an open-world conversion done right.The combat is the same old soulsborne system that you've already made your mind up about whether you like or not, with some extra tweaks for variety. But what Elden Ring really excels in is the open world of exploration it wraps it in. Strong art direction coupled with intruiging writing make for sights worth seeing, and the reward loop for exploring is borderline addictive. Every single little cave, camp, crevasse and keep has its own boss and unique item as a reward for beating it, making for a ludicrously large assortment of builds to go for. This, of course, comes with the standard high difficulty attached. But in practice the spikes of hardship make for satisfying goals to work towards via leveling.There are other sharp edges, however, that you'll need to acclimate to. In a bit of ""have your cake and eat it"" design, you'll be showered with lots of weapons, but you'll still need to stick to one and upgrade it. Which can get really boring over the course of a hundred hours if your moveset is narrow. Some items and spells are balanced around PVP instead of solo play. Which can, unintuitively, lead to upgrades being downgrades in practice. And you won't be able to tell until you've invested a lot of resources into unlocking or upgrading them. There's also plenty of things to watch out for that will make the game harder if you're not aware of them:1. The game is designed for co-op. The bossfights are tuned to be challenging even when two players are bouncing aggro between them. Which means that if you're playing solo, your summon is a part of your build as much as anything else. And forgoing it makes things exponentially harder.2. The game expects you to explore and level a lot. If you try to just stick to the critical path to beat it as quickly as possible, you're in for a rude surprise in its later half of the game due to the sheer amount of damage enemies deal there.3. Not all builds are made equal. Your experience will vary a lot based on whether you have a ranged attack, or are going melee only. Especially since some of the bosses are so big that being in melee range means you can't see their swings.But all of those aren't necessarily shortcomings. Think of them as an indirect difficulty setting. You can go for the easiest approach in each scenario, or you can self-impose challenges for extra thrill. It's just a mindset thing that you have to be aware of going in. Other than that, the game is sublime. You'll encounter the odd glitch and weird physics interaction here and there, but other than that it's way more polished that you'd expect for the open-world genre.",write tin say dark soul open world get exactli say tin give take quirk rare case openworld convers done rightth combat old soulsborn system youv alreadi made mind whether like extra tweak varieti elden ring realli excel open world explor wrap strong art direct coupl intruig write make sight worth see reward loop explor borderlin addict everi singl littl cave camp crevass keep boss uniqu item reward beat make ludicr larg assort build go cours come standard high difficulti attach practic spike hardship make satisfi goal work toward via levelingther sharp edg howev youll need acclim bit cake eat design youll shower lot weapon youll still need stick one upgrad get realli bore cours hundr hour moveset narrow item spell balanc around pvp instead solo play unintuit lead upgrad downgrad practic wont abl tell youv invest lot resourc unlock upgrad there also plenti thing watch make game harder your awar game design coop bossfight tune challeng even two player bounc aggro mean your play solo summon part build much anyth els forgo make thing exponenti game expect explor level lot tri stick critic path beat quickli possibl your rude surpris later half game due sheer amount damag enemi deal build made equal experi vari lot base whether rang attack go mele especi sinc boss big mele rang mean cant see swingsbut arent necessarili shortcom think indirect difficulti set go easiest approach scenario selfimpos challeng extra thrill mindset thing awar go game sublim youll encount odd glitch weird physic interact way polish youd expect openworld genr

"Buckle up, fellow adventurer, because I’m about to take you on a mythical journey through the extraordinary realms of Black Myth: Wukong. 🌟🐒🔥The Legend Unfolds: From the moment I stepped into this ancient world, I felt the pulse of its magic. The mist-clad forests whispered secrets, and the pagodas stood like silent sentinels, guarding forgotten knowledge. Wukong, our rebellious hero, radiated charisma. His staff crackled with energy, and his eyes held the weight of centuries.Combat as Poetry: Picture this: Wukong, surrounded by foes, his staff an extension of his will. Each swing, a brushstroke on the canvas of chaos. The combat system dances between elegance and brutality. I pirouetted through enemy formations, deflecting arrows, and delivering spinning kicks that sent demons sprawling. Boss battles? They’re symphonies of strategy and spectacle. I faced a serpent with scales like jade, a thunder deity crackling with lightning, and a shape-shifting fox spirit. Each encounter left me breathless, heart pounding.A Canvas of Dreams: The visuals—oh, the visuals! The artists dipped their brushes in starlight and painted landscapes that defy reality. Cherry blossoms swirled in the wind, and ancient temples clung to cliffs like stubborn memories. When Wukong ascended a mountain peak, the world unfolded below—a tapestry of wonder. And those animated vignettes at the end of each chapter? Pure magic. They revealed the antagonist’s tragic past, leaving me haunted and hungry for more.Threads of Fate: The story weaves threads from the classic Journey to the West. It’s like sipping tea with Sun Wukong himself, listening to tales of gods and demons. Sure, some references might elude newcomers, but they’re breadcrumbs leading to deeper mysteries. I reveled in the lore, piecing together prophecies and ancient scrolls.The Glitches and Grins: Okay, let’s address the quirks. Occasionally, the game hiccupped like a startled dragon. Crashes? Yep.

"2022 This is probably one of the best games (100% best soulslike, sorry Nioh 2 :<) i ever played. I really can't think of last time i had such blast with AAA title. There are minor things i didnt enjoy like few stupididly overpowered enemies or few gameplay features like horse combat, but overall - open world and such exploration works amazing in soulslike formula.About perfomance, I personally didnt have problems with stuttering or frame drops (I did crashed 5 or 6 times during my playthrough), even more my rig is below minimal specs and i had stable 30fps on high settings. I highly recommend, even to new souls players.And Ranni best girl, best ending.",probabl one best game best soulslik sorri nioh ever play realli cant think last time blast aaa titl minor thing didnt enjoy like stupididli overpow enemi gameplay featur like hors combat overal open world explor work amaz soulslik formulaabout perfom person didnt problem stutter frame drop crash time playthrough even rig minim spec stabl high set highli recommend even new soul playersand ranni best girl best end

"I'm not much of a review poster as you can probably see, this is my third review that i'm writing and i played hundreds upon hundreds of games, so that means this is the third game that really made me want to write a review.Almost 100 hours into the game, yes i really took my time on my first run, i literally beat the game hours ago aswell and let me tell you, this game is an absolute masterpiece. I wish that i can express in more detail on how i feel about the game, but i just can't, it's that good. The last time i felt this excited, hyped and super happy about playing a game is when Elden Ring came out, this game managed to bring those feelings forward again.Visuals of the game are so damn pretty, graphics are insane i literally built a PC for this game and it was so worth it, combat is out of this world very fluid and engaging, i absolutely loved every character i met, the cutscene animation after ending the chapters were such a treat to watch, oh and not to mention the intro! i don't think there's a game that will top the intro of Wukong, that sh*t was absolutely epic, UI was fantastic, Amazing boss designs which were based off of chinese mythology/folklore i believe and the list keeps on going, so yeah this game is just a beast. I could keep on going but i dont want to make this review way too long.Bottom line is: Buy this game, its just phenomenal. I am hoping that this game will win GOTY it absolutely deserves the award. - 9.5/10 rating from me too.",im much review poster probabl see third review im write play hundr upon hundr game mean third game realli made want write reviewalmost hour game ye realli took time first run liter beat game hour ago aswel let tell game absolut masterpiec wish express detail feel game cant good last time felt excit hype super happi play game elden ring came game manag bring feel forward againvisu game damn pretti graphic insan liter built pc game worth combat world fluid engag absolut love everi charact met cutscen anim end chapter treat watch oh mention intro dont think there game top intro wukong sht absolut epic ui fantast amaz boss design base chines mythologyfolklor believ list keep go yeah game beast could keep go dont want make review way longbottom line buy game phenomen hope game win goti absolut deserv award rate

"2022 ORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW:Game itself is 10/10. But the PC version stutters a lot, and makes it unnecessarily difficult to play. Masterpiece, best game ever made, it's already ruined my life, but clearly it's unfinished from an optimization point of view. When they fix this issue (which I'm confident they will... it's From Software), I'll rewrite this review and soyjak over the game like a redditor visiting Elon's lithium mines.NEW STUFF:The stutters have become less frequent, but I don't really care anymore. This game is such a masterpiece, I get so enthralled by what's happening on screen that I can't tell if it's running at 20 FPS or 60. When I first played Sekiro, I couldn't go back to Dark Souls for a while because it seemed so slow and boring in comparison. This is giving me the same effect, it makes the previous games feel incomplete in comparison. The melee combat is tied with Sekiro for my fave in any game. It even made magic fun, somehow. Still doesn't run the best, but for me that isn't enough to justify not recommending this game to everyone.",origin neg reviewgam pc version stutter lot make unnecessarili difficult play masterpiec best game ever made alreadi ruin life clearli unfinish optim point view fix issu im confid softwar ill rewrit review soyjak game like redditor visit elon lithium minesnew stuffth stutter becom less frequent dont realli care anymor game masterpiec get enthral what happen screen cant tell run fp first play sekiro couldnt go back dark soul seem slow bore comparison give effect make previou game feel incomplet comparison mele combat tie sekiro fave game even made magic fun somehow still doesnt run best isnt enough justifi recommend game everyon
"2023 Theres a lot more they have added over the years to your campaign map features, building outposts in other factions settlements, war coordination is better and has more options, quests issued by other factions as well as setting quests for other factions, there are many quests centered around artifacts/gear and map elements as well. Interesting events occur during the campaign and overall I'd say that the turn based campaign portion of total war has never been better. Each faction being so different in warhammer has allowed for interesting faction-unique systems to be implemented that keep each playthrough fresh. The mechanics behind each faction will drive you to play very differently than you played the last and it has really sucked me back in to total war for the first time in years. The ""RPG"" elements are deeper than ever, which I understand was never the draw of total war, but truthfully, in this fantasy setting I have found that it adds a great layer of gameplay I really enjoy. Sending an army stack off to go on an epic quest for it's leading lord is truthfully fun af and it feels like every lord, even the randomly generated ones, can develop a whole story of their own. Meanwhile you are still playing total war.The engine is the best this time around it has ever been. It runs so smooth I can scarcely believe it. I am using the same cpu I played attila on and the difference is night and day. I have had no AI issues, the unit mass seems perfect, the animations are the best they have been and the game just plays extremely well, even on keep walls. It is really exciting to play through imo and if you have stepped away from total war for a time, coming back will be a huge breathe of fresh air. It is so good, my fiance who has never played this kind of game, took to it immediately. It is still the warhammer versions of total war, so expect extremely powerful lords with rpg features, but this game proves the next historical title will be a home-run because of it's engine and AI improvements alone. A big leap forward for the total war franchise.CA sucks for the way they monetize their games though. I wish steam ratings were star based so I could take a star off for that... but.. I have to admit. They have something locked down that is just insanely unique and impressive and they deserve to be the kings of this genre, it's just so frustrating to stumble through their lists of dlc and insane prices. They STILL sell blood in their games. One thing I will give them is they made it so if you own blood for the blood god in any of the warhammer games it unlocks it for warhammer 3, which is great, but it's not an accolade I feel right giving because it should not be there in the first place.Overall, epic fantasy total war game from a greedy publisher.",there lot ad year campaign map featur build outpost faction settlement war coordin better option quest issu faction well set quest faction mani quest center around artifactsgear map element well interest event occur campaign overal id say turn base campaign portion total war never better faction differ warhamm allow interest factionuniqu system implement keep playthrough fresh mechan behind faction drive play differ play last realli suck back total war first time year rpg element deeper ever understand never draw total war truth fantasi set found add great layer gameplay realli enjoy send armi stack go epic quest lead lord truth fun af feel like everi lord even randomli gener one develop whole stori meanwhil still play total warth engin best time around ever run smooth scarc believ use cpu play attila differ night day ai issu unit mass seem perfect anim best game play extrem well even keep wall realli excit play imo step away total war time come back huge breath fresh air good fianc never play kind game took immedi still warhamm version total war expect extrem power lord rpg featur game prove next histor titl homerun engin ai improv alon big leap forward total war franchiseca suck way monet game though wish steam rate star base could take star admit someth lock insan uniqu impress deserv king genr frustrat stumbl list dlc insan price still sell blood game one thing give made blood blood god warhamm game unlock warhamm great accolad feel right give first placeoveral epic fantasi total war game greedi publish

"After 282 hours of gameplay:I logged in tonight only to be greeted with a notice that I was permanently banned from my main server without any clear explanation. The only support available is through their Discord bot, which, after I provided the requested details, informed me that I was banned for using cheat software that allegedly gave me an unfair advantage. They even ended the message with a bizarre note, wishing me a good life and hoping I’d leave a positive review.The issue seems to stem from having ""Process Hacker,"" an alternative task manager, installed on my PC. Many other players have experienced the same problem—wrongfully banned due to false positives from their anti-cheat system—yet have found no real help from customer support. The bot is the only method of contact, and it’s frustratingly unhelpful and impersonal.In my experience, the support for this game is effectively non-existent. I strongly advise anyone thinking of playing to stick to the free-to-play experience and NOT spend any money until they address these issues and establish a proper support team.

"2019 Tl;dr - fun and a competitive game. Has it's toxic side just like any other multiplayer game. 8/10 would recommend it. This game is the epitome of reflex. I love this game because it's simple yet the most complex of strategies can be implied. It doesn't just test your mechanical skill but also makes you really put in a mental effort. Really fun in a competitive 5 man lobby. Thank heavens this game enables you to access the settings menu whilst queuing for a match.. it was due for years. The new UI seems innovative but I suppose there is still more room for improvement. Having about an average number of hours. here's what the pros and cons of this game are to me- Pros: If you love a fast paced competitive game, this is the game for you. Simple (no breaking walls and ♥♥♥♥) yet it's fun and there's a lot of ♥♥♥♥ you can do to achieve success - victory, fun, both; whatever objective you have set for yourself/definition you have set for the word. Could also make a great game to play casually between other games, you find these kinds of players mostly in the lower ranks. In-game ranking system to motivate you on a short-term to play more and get better. Besides the Competitive (classic 5v5) game mode, there are many others you can choose from. Community made maps and skins to give you a better experience. Being updated regularly- new maps, changes in existing maps, changes in the economy in-game, etc,- leads to creating new metas. 3rd party matchmaking clients (ESEA, SoStronk, Faceit) offer more opportunities with more stable and better servers (128 tick), tournaments over various periods of time, in-built ranking system with lots of prizes to be won- really brings out the most out of this game- thus leading to a newer and better experience, for the ones who take this game seriously and for the ones who play casually both alike. Very active and an entertaining e-sport scene- the content it provides really shows that humans are capable of the impossible. Pretty cool community, I've played a lot of other games and have been a part of many communities but I've got to say the CS:GO community is pretty cool. We have one of the smartest, one of the most humorous communities on Twitch, Reddit and on YouTube, unlike in other games where at least one of these platforms are more cancerous than the better part of them. And ah, some extremely attractive female streamers and pro players.Cons- Matchmaking servers are the worst... I don't know what the devs have planned for this game. The servers are never stable and really ruins the experience for us. This game was at a point where all of us were gonna request Valve to upgrade the MM servers to 128 tick but really need to resort to 3rd party clients and many of us really don't want to do that ALL the time or cannot. So many bugs and stuff being abused in maps and this game takes forever to get them fixed. I know this is a long shot since it took them years to make other sub-menus accessible while in queue for a match.. but would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GREAT if we had the option to choose servers. Indians and Pinoys are literally the worst. I'm not generalising but you know it makes no difference to generalise or not because I've never had a good experience with players from these nations. They RUIN our games. Can't have one fun match without an incompetent Indian crying on the mic in Hindi about some really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Like just shut the ♥♥♥♥ UP dude. Always looking for something to blame, extremely annoying when they rush first, die and then comment on what you're doing and if you don't do as they say they just have a mental breakdown on mic. Thank goodness this game is capable of a block communication feature. I don't even know how they get to the ranks they do with their intellectually incapable selves. They're extremely bad and just hold your team down. Super toxic. I don't mind losing because it's a fair part of the game but the games are just RUINED by these players. Coming from overpopulated countries where they don't get enough attention or where they can't get any due to the lack of a special talent, they just show their frustration on the mic and ruin the experience for us. Videos on YouTube get super popular in the CS:GO communities and these players just try out tricks/tips/ whatever BUGS they've discovered etc. and because of their incompetency they fail and it isn't fun nor productive. Request to all Indian and Filipinos- please do not try out the stuff you see on videos. They hold an IQ threshold that you people cannot match. It only ruins our games. And I'm sure every region has some ♥♥♥♥ like this so it's only fair CS:GO let's us choose our servers to reduce the risk of getting into a game with an Indian or whoever with an underdeveloped brain. Hackers and smurfs are still into existence despite the efforts of Valve. It bums me the ♥♥♥♥ out because I've exchanged a lot more time and effort to get to the same rank as the hacker or smurf did only to get paired against them for a definite loss in elo points. Ruined the game after it became f2p. After this game turned f2p the servers became WORSE due to the high load and they removed the option to report servers. It's like they knew it was bound to happen. Great, the game struggled with stable mm servers and now make the game f2p and introduce the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Battle Royale in existence - Danger Zone. Poorly optimised game, anybody that gets <250 fps know the huge drop in fps when in smokes etc. Hope Valve does something about the servers and add more features to this game instead of funding some ♥♥♥♥ p2w garbage like ARTIFACT that nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about. -Tips for new players: 1. Get some friends to play with to begin with. More known players more the merrier.2. You can completely customise how the games looks for you. Crosshair, viewmodel etc can be adjusted for your convenience. Make use of it.3. Watch videos. 4. Indians/Pinoys on your team or general mic cancer teammates? Type enable_voice 0 in console.. you're welcome.Conclusion: It's a fun game if you've a taste for competitiveness. Lower skill curve yet hard to master. 8/10 would recommend it.My first review and it's long as ♥♥♥♥ I don't think most of you would read it- but for those who have regardless of whether you relate to my review or not, thank you for spending time on this.

"Have not played anything other than the campaign so far and am only 4 hours in. Take that for what you will. If you're a Warhammer fan, this is a must buy. If you're a fan of the idea of a 3rd person DOOM style experience with over the top executions and a fun selection of melee and ranged weapons, then this is a must buy. I've been waiting for this game for 10 years and it has largely delivered, but I do have a few gripes. Gripe 1: Annoying bugs (not the enemies in game). In a 4 hour session, my friends and I managed to bug an encounter that would force us to reload last checkpoint at least 5 times. Luckily the checkpoints are rather frequent so we didn't get set far back, but still annoying. Gripe 2: No camera position or FOV controls. I just wish I could pan the camera back even just a little bit. Titus is a massive space marine and takes up a rather significant portion of the screen. I get the armor is detailed and all, but I want to see the enemies coming at me before they're in my teeth. Being able to back the camera up would be so nice. Also don't remember seeing a setting to change the position of the camera from right shoulder to left or in my preference, middle. Gripe 3: The bolter's sound design is lackluster. They sound like they pack a punch, don't get me wrong. But it does not sound like I'm firing a gun that's launching .998 caliber mass reactive shells.

Lots of features and gameplay were buggy (nothing new for CA, unfortunately) and the motivation to play a campaign for more than 50 turns (usually 1-2h) was nowhere to be found due to the state of the game. Minor fixes were out in the coming months, but they didn't change much as to enjoy the game as much as I did WH2.At the same time, CA kept churning out DLC after DLC with less and less content, while major issues still persisted with the base game. Several years have passed and the developers are still unable to make the game enjoyable while stating they need more and more money to keep the ""support up"".

"As of writing this review I have never been more torn on whether to recommend a game or not.The campaign has moments which will make Warhammer fans giddy like a kid at Christmas, especially on the last two missions (if you've played it you know.) Even non Warhammer fans will have a good time with this. The voice acting, graphics and audio are all strong. However, it's criminally short. Took me about 5.5 hours to complete and I died...a lot. The AI in this game is something out of 2004. Squad mates will watch you getting annihilated and not budge an inch, or decide to stand in front of you as you attempt to lay waste to heretics. It's infuriating, and something you'll need to get used to because the online matchmaking in SM2 is straight up cheeks. I hope you enjoy restarting your game a lot, and loading screens, because you'll become familiar with both. Bugs, crashes, loooong loading times, and infinite loading times are going to likely infest your experience worse than any Tyranid could, and this after the game was already pushed back a considerable amount of time. The core game play of SM2 is really solid. Any third person shooter fans, especially those that enjoyed Gears of War are going to have a great time. It's challenging, brutal and unapologetic in it's approach. It knows it's target audience and swings for the fences, and most of the time it connects.This game will live or die in the next 3-6 months on how much the Dev will support it. Fixing the myriad of tech issues, and bringing more content to coop and multiplayer. More maps are needed, it's a non-negotiable. SM2 is a real mixed bag. A frustrating, disappointing mixed bag all within a room filled with potential. This could be something truly special but it's not there...yet.I'm going to reluctantly recommend it purely because I'm a Warhammer fan, and there are moments in this game that are perfection, but as a non Warhammer fan wait for a sale. By that time you'll have a feel for how many of the issues have been fixed, and what the landscape is looking like with more content to make it worthwhile.",write review never torn whether recommend game notth campaign moment make warhamm fan giddi like kid christma especi last two mission youv play know even non warhamm fan good time voic act graphic audio strong howev crimin short took hour complet dieda lot ai game someth squad mate watch get annihil budg inch decid stand front attempt lay wast heret infuri someth youll need get use onlin matchmak straight cheek hope enjoy restart game lot load screen youll becom familiar bug crash loooong load time infinit load time go like infest experi wors tyranid could game alreadi push back consider amount time core game play realli solid third person shooter fan especi enjoy gear war go great time challeng brutal unapologet approach know target audienc swing fenc time connectsthi game live die next month much dev support fix myriad tech issu bring content coop multiplay map need nonnegoti real mix bag frustrat disappoint mix bag within room fill potenti could someth truli special thereyetim go reluctantli recommend pure im warhamm fan moment game perfect non warhamm fan wait sale time youll feel mani issu fix landscap look like content make worthwhil

"Been playing pretty much every day since July 17th, putting in a ton of hours since then. The game was fun for awhile, but getting to endgame and running into a ton of game breaking bugs has killed that fun for me. Doing Prime Wars with large groups of people, which is pretty much the PvE endgame only for the bosses to bug out and become immune, or for the entire server to lag so bad you can't even shoot or switch weapons. These aren't rare occurrences, they happen each and every Prime War. The devs have done nothing to address it, instead they just kept adding higher and higher difficulties. Last update they added a new public event called Ancient One's Trial, I was excited until I climbed all the way to the top of the mountain just to realize the event was bugged and you couldn't start it. They added tameable animals, but of course they are also bugged. They can disappear, their tameness can reset completely or they can just bug through the floor and escape. Of course after everything, instead of fixing major bugs that have been in the game since I started, they added loot boxes which I was stupid enough to buy with currency that was in my account. Woopsies that currency wasn't mine, it was given to me and many other players in error, and if you spent it, well now your account is in the negative and you have to pay to get back to 0 before you can buy anything else.Avoid the game, maybe come back in a year or two if it's not abandoned by then.",play pretti much everi day sinc juli put ton hour sinc game fun awhil get endgam run ton game break bug kill fun prime war larg group peopl pretti much pve endgam boss bug becom immun entir server lag bad cant even shoot switch weapon arent rare occurr happen everi prime war dev done noth address instead kept ad higher higher difficulti last updat ad new public event call ancient one trial excit climb way top mountain realiz event bug couldnt start ad tameabl anim cours also bug disappear tame reset complet bug floor escap cours everyth instead fix major bug game sinc start ad loot box stupid enough buy currenc account woopsi currenc wasnt mine given mani player error spent well account neg pay get back buy anyth elseavoid game mayb come back year two abandon

"2022 Prolog was lit....BUT....Main Campaign sucks (after turn 50-70 campaign mechanics becomes very big nuisance).Gameplay changes seems to be in good direction but currently its very buggy and pathfinding in these new settlements is slogfest at best and during melee clash some units just bug out and stay at one place don't atack/move, they just teabag at place.Range units no way to micro as they freak out when selecting target and must be left at fire at will.Several campaign technologies don't work or break mechanics in battle some army abbilities don't work or work halfway.Siege battels feels like some mobile game AI re-construct towers constantly (small reconstruction time penalty) and your forced to rush and because of the buggy pathfinding it becomes a mess like total anarchy levels of fakary.Nurgle is very weak compared to other daemon factions the legendary lord Daemon prince is weak as hell, autoresolve is broken (only kislec is fair) for some races and for others makes you play every battle as units have 10 armor and makes them weak in autoresolve for some reason(Slanesh).I would not recomend the game for its main Campaign. If you want it only for imortal Campaign then yes i would recomend as it will bring the trilogy together.",prolog litbutmain campaign suck turn campaign mechan becom big nuisancegameplay chang seem good direct current buggi pathfind new settlement slogfest best mele clash unit bug stay one place dont atackmov teabag placerang unit way micro freak select target must left fire willsever campaign technolog dont work break mechan battl armi abbl dont work work halfwaysieg battel feel like mobil game ai reconstruct tower constantli small reconstruct time penalti forc rush buggi pathfind becom mess like total anarchi level fakarynurgl weak compar daemon faction legendari lord daemon princ weak hell autoresolv broken kislec fair race other make play everi battl unit armor make weak autoresolv reasonslaneshi would recomend game main campaign want imort campaign ye would recomend bring trilog togeth
"2022 For update on this game please scroll to the end of review!I have put in over 1200 hrs into the Total War games series. Over 663 hours spent on Warhammer 2, so am a fan not a hater & am giving my honest opinion of this game.The campaign in Warhammer 3 forces you into a non-expansion type of play using limited armies to play 'wack a mole' with rift openings (which cause out of balance corruption in your territory).The forced claiming of 4 demon souls element was annoying & boring in equal measure.The story line is poor in my opinion. Many gamers have already stated an option to TURN OFF (or at least adjust the tempo of) the Chaos Portals & the 'soul collection' would have improved the game hugely as many players don't like the campaign & others like to play a slower, domination type, or more expansionist game...the list goes on but basically any options for going outside of a very limited & rushed linear play style have been taken away.Sadly I have found the campaign in WH3 to be restrictive, & not fun. I don't think the Campaign is fixable as it would need a complete redesign. Honestly I am sad to say Warhammer 3 is in my opinion not worth buying at the present due to its high price & would recommend Warhammer 2 to anyone new to the series.If & when a free 'Mortal Empires' upgrade becomes available I will update this review, but as for now my advice is save your money for something more fun.Update 20/03/2022After looking for a while online I feel that CREATIVE ASSEMBLY are sadly not replying to their customers attempts at making their views known, to my knowledge no Acknowledgement has been made about the Campaign in WH3 being poorly received by the player base, many other widely made criticisms are also not being publicly addressed.Have CREATIVE ASSEMBLY banned their staff from mentioning anything that would affect sales figures? The Wall of Silence from the developers/makers of this product is deafening & more than slightly annoying for those of us who pre-purchased this game or who have bought early at full price only to get what we feel is a sub-standard experience.Update 22/04/2022 .....I am sad to say Warhammer 3 is now uninstalled , the campaign was boring & frustrating the first time & has no replay value. As a fan I can only hope for a better game in future but will not hold my breath. Really feel let down by this game , especially after all the ads & hype from the developers. A big price tag for a deeply flawed game!!!Update 3/5/2022Warhammer 3 is not in 'Steam Stats' top 100 games when even Warhammer 2 is still clinging on...says it all really.Update 06/09/2022 I am changing this review to positive now 'Immortal Empires' has been released, this is now the game it should have been on release. Although the developers are calling it a beta, I have played around 100 hours & found it to be stable. The game is being well supported at the moment with updates & patches coming thick & fast, a refreshing change to some previous Total War offerings.Immortal Empires is all in all a fantastic game & well worth the money now.",updat game pleas scroll end reviewi put hr total war game seri hour spent warhamm fan hater give honest opinion gameth campaign warhamm forc nonexpans type play use limit armi play wack mole rift open caus balanc corrupt territoryth forc claim demon soul element annoy bore equal measureth stori line poor opinion mani gamer alreadi state option turn least adjust tempo chao portal soul collect would improv game huge mani player dont like campaign other like play slower domin type expansionist gameth list goe basic option go outsid limit rush linear play style taken awaysadli found campaign restrict fun dont think campaign fixabl would need complet redesign honestli sad say warhamm opinion worth buy present due high price would recommend warhamm anyon new seriesif free mortal empir upgrad becom avail updat review advic save money someth funupd look onlin feel creativ assembl sadli repli custom attempt make view known knowledg acknowledg made campaign poorli receiv player base mani wide made critic also publicli addressedhav creativ assembl ban staff mention anyth would affect sale figur wall silenc developersmak product deafen slightli annoy us prepurchas game bought earli full price get feel substandard experienceupd sad say warhamm uninstal campaign bore frustrat first time replay valu fan hope better game futur hold breath realli feel let game especi ad hype develop big price tag deepli flaw gameupd steam stat top game even warhamm still cling onsay reallyupd chang review posit immort empir releas game releas although develop call beta play around hour found stabl game well support moment updat patch come thick fast refresh chang previou total war offeringsimmort empir fantast game well worth money

"2017 Let me preface this just a bit.I love Counter-Strike. I've met so many cool people over the years I've played, had so many laughs and good times, it's been a blast. However, I'd say about 95% of that was purely through casual. So after 500+ hours in the game, I decided to try and get into the competitive scene. I got a few buddies together and we were gradually progressing through the silver ranks (I know call me bad, ♥♥♥♥, etc.) and we were having good fun. We'd win 3, lose 1, but the point was that it was fun.However, as we got higher and higher up, it stopped being fun. The reason? Absolutely piss poor matchmaking and security from Valve's end. I can understand one bad game or 2, but it got to the point where it was consitently terrible. At this point I had stopped queing with less than a full lobby. Me and a couple friends would get qued up with people with 900 ping who were basically worse than bots, they'd leave, and then its a 3v5 for the entire match. Experiences like this, are not fun, at all. The worst part though, is the amount of painfully obvious hackers in this game. VAC is the poorest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse for an anti-cheat system I've ever seen. One hacker will basically carry an entire team, and 9/10 times the enemy team won't have the integrity to kick the blatant hacker, because he'll carry them to the next rank. The most you can do is report them, but with how cheap this game is, it's no problem for people to make another account and rinse-repeat. Valve makes more than enough money on this game to justify having a better anti-cheat system. It is honestly one of the saddest examples of a company not giving a ♥♥♥♥ about their community that I can think of in the gaming industry. Say what you want about EA being a money hungry ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company that hates their fans, I guarantee you that you won't run into as many hackers on official Dice Battlefield servers than you will an official CSGO server. That's just sad. Again, I love this game. If you want to play casual or community or what have you, you'll probably have a great time learning the quirks of the game, learning the maps, and engaging with the goofy ass community I've come to love/hate. However, the competitive scene is pure cancer. I do hope that Valve reads these, even though I highly doubt it, because I truly want what's best for this game.

"2022 The campaign is still hilariously awful 4 months after release. If you're behind from the first rift, you will never be able to win the campaign conventionally without spending upwards of another 100 turns sending your non-faction leader armies across the map to remove the other factions from the game, thus eventually freeing up your own faction leader to finally get the souls you need. If they made it so that your other lords could actually use the rifts to traverse the map, even if they can't get into the chaos god areas, it would be functional as you'd be able to delay or even prevent other faction leaders from entering the rifts and letting you catch up.Just wait until Immortal Empires, at least then there will be a game mode that's enjoyable.",campaign still hilari aw month releas your behind first rift never abl win campaign convent without spend upward anoth turn send nonfact leader armi across map remov faction game thu eventu free faction leader final get soul need made lord could actual use rift travers map even cant get chao god area would function youd abl delay even prevent faction leader enter rift let catch upjust wait immort empir least game mode that enjoy

"I am quite impressed with this game both in terms of its gameplay and visuals after finishing the introduction. I'm excited to start playing the rest of the game in co-op with my sister. However, I cannot ever recommend a game that forcibly installs unnecessary Epic Games bloatware on your PC upon initial launch. I bought* a Steam game to play with other players on Steam only. (*Well actually, my lovely sister gifted me the game, but my statement remains otherwise the same. Thank you so much, sis! ^-^) Fortunately, as long as you don't care about crossplay, the game is entirely functional without Epic Games Online and it can be easily removed from the installation. Here's how to do so.1) Launch the game. The game will immediately attempt to install Epic Online Services. Cancel the installation box before it finishes. You will be met with an error message upon reaching the main menu. The EOS was never successfully installed, but remnants of the software are still on your machine.2) Turn off crossplay in the game options menu of the game.3) Close the game. Uninstall Epic Online Services from the list of programs on your computer.4) Delete the Epic Online Services folder from the game's installation folder in your Steam library.5) Reboot your computer and relaunch the game. The game will greet you with the error message when you reach the main menu whenever you start the game, but EOS will never again attempt to install itself on your machine. The game is fully functional without crossplay.

"2017 Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet. Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC. If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

"2022 I'm not really the target audience for Elden Ring given it's a souls-like, but if that is your cup of tea, this game is phenomenal. Despite really, really not being the game for me, it was mechanically engaging with beautiful visuals and audio. Although capped at 60 fps, it runs buttery smooth and never drops frames on my system. The story is complicated, a little too complicated for a game who's target audience is just going to roll and slash through all the bosses without really paying attention to any cut scenes or flavor text. Some are saying its the greatest open world game they have ever played, to those I say stop playing souls-like games and actually branch out. Elden Ring's world is jam packed with content and enemies, but it always felt small to me and too easily traversed to really be compared to any other large open world game. Lets be realistic, if you think this is GOTY or even comparable to other great classic titles like RDR2 or BoTW, then you already think that FromSoftware's next game is GOTY for 2023 or 2024. My only real complaint is that the multiplayer is HORRIBLE. Despite being the most accessible souls-like game for newcomers, no one thought to allow players to opt out of invasions. Definitely a lost opportunity. The game is hard enough without getting sweat on by people who have never seen the outside world. Playing with friends is clunky, unintuitive, and tied to an in-game item that you have to grind for. FromSoftware clearly walked down the street and pulled the multiplayer design from Nintendo who is known ubiquitously for their HORRIBLE multiplayer implementation.

"2019 This will be my first review ever on Steam, it's sad it has to come under these circumstances but after 2.5k+ hours on csgo I feel sick to my stomach and I want to let people know what's up. CSGO is dead, the devs are letting cheaters (mostly Russians) plague servers without batting an eyelash. VAC (the ""anti-cheat"" system) is useless, as is the overwatch. With the game turning f2p hords of hopelessly bad players came flooding servers, turning hacks on the second they get killed by legit players. I've been in games where all 9 other players were openly cheating, activating spinbots, speedhacks, wallhacks, no recoil and many others.I haven't had a single cheater-free game in days. It's shameful for Valve to allow an otherwise great game to get dragged in the mud so pathetically. This is not just a huge waste for the industry, it is also a blatant message that Valve does not care about their community. To me it is disgusting that they would let down a 20-year loyal playerbase in such a disgraceful manner. Sad timesEdit: With Valorant coming out, one really realizes how CSGO actually is hot garbage lol. Servs are trash, the netcode is basically a diceroll meaning your aim doesn't count because the game is developped so poorly. Glad it is getting rekt by Val, Valve deserves Riot as a competitor, both companies are a pile of impotent fools who are clueless af.

"2014 This is an extremely mixed and short review.I think the game has cool and original gameplay. Though it doesn't highly innovate, it stills maintains the Counter-Strike gameplay that has been going on for about 15 years. Let's talk about the community. About 5% of the people you meet on Global Offensive are really nice people. 95% think they're MLG ♥♥♥♥♥ and WILL kick you if you're not very good. I've been kicked multiple times and it feels awful, to think that people don't want you on your team. Makes my stomach drop to the bottomless pit.Seriously, beware of the abysmal community and stick with your friends. If you work together with your friends to prevent the opposing team from winning, you'll have a much better time than you would being John Rambo.But now I'm going to say this is an amazing game and I totally recommend playing it if you like competetive, slow-paced games then play with a group of friends, you'll have fun.",extrem mix short reviewi think game cool origin gameplay though doesnt highli innov still maintain counterstrik gameplay go year let talk commun peopl meet global offens realli nice peopl think theyr mlg kick your good ive kick multipl time feel aw think peopl dont want team make stomach drop bottomless pitseri bewar abysm commun stick friend work togeth friend prevent oppos team win youll much better time would john rambobut im go say amaz game total recommend play like competet slowpac game play group friend youll fun

"2023 As someone who loved the first two games, and the third at first, it baffles me their response to people being mad about the DLC reception is to throw more fuel on the fire and try to stomp the conversation. Is talk off topic, sure, but it silencing it only shows you don't care to actually take your communities VALID complaints into consideration, and you haven't heard of the Streisand effect. The line “The right to discuss is a privilege—it is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game…” is just false, the people who pay for the game let you have a job and do what you love, and should have a say, even its a stupid one. If their words gain traction, maybe look inward and try to see why doom saying, calling for boycotts, or any other conversations you don't like are appearing and getting louder.

"Playing ""Once Human"" is like discovering a new Chinese takeout place. You decide to try it because it’s new and affordable, and then you end up enjoying a succulent meal. It has all the familiar ingredients you’ve seen before, but they’re combined in a way that feels fresh and well-balanced.""Once Human"" is a free-to-play game featuring in-game currency for cosmetics, with no pay-to-win elements at all. It blends elements from other games like The Division(gunplay) , Palworld(base economy and pets) and Rust(base building) . You can dive into hardcore grinding to get the best loot, or you can focus on building a beautiful base where you can relax and automate the game loop. Alternatively, you can simply enjoy the view on your motorcycle. Enjoy it on a PVP or a PVE Server pick your poison.Overall, it’s a great game, but it does have its flaws but nothing that seems unfixable:Combat: The combat is too simple for my taste. You can take on mobs and bosses that are way over-leveled with ease.Environment: Some areas need reworking. There are places where the floor levels don’t match, creating unsightly gaps where you can get stuck.Despite its flaws, ""Once Human"" offers an engaging experience with a variety of activities to suit different playstyles.

"2021 There's no need to present this game, as it's known worldwide.The fact that Valve hasn't put any effort at all into this game in the last decade is also just widely known.

No need to take care of those.Valve had a better idea: MAKE IT FREEValve's Expectation: A lot more players will play the game we ignore so hardly.Reality: Every banned cheater can create another account and continue destroying the gaming experience of others.If you're really hesitating to get this game or not, I strongly advise against getting it. It feels like every other game is infected by these little cheater parasites. And Valve doesn't care. They announce the 'BIG CHANGE IN VAC-SECURITY', but nothing changed. People are obviously cheating and even bragging about it in the chat. Still no ban. I don't know when Valve stopped caring about its players, but this is just ridiculous. I know nothing will be coming from my review, but if I can just convince 1 person to not get this game, it wasn't in vain. Just wait for another few months or years and there will be another Counter Strike. And few days later it will again be infected by cheaters. @Valve: You're forcefully destroying one of the games, that made you what you are today. Simply by not acting.

2021 This game suffers from alot of bugs and the optimization does get worse and worse with every patch. (Lower FPS every patch)The matchmaking servers are filled with cheaters and the servers itself is not good. They have a high variance and a dipping server FPS resulting in a inconsistent experience.It´s a tiny bit more hardcore than Source was but do not give you that nice feeling Counter-Strike 1.6 and lower did when you was younger.It´s only an O.K game if you play pugs or clan matches.,game suffer alot bug optim get wors wors everi patch lower fp everi patchth matchmak server fill cheater server good high varianc dip server fp result inconsist experienceit tini bit hardcor sourc give nice feel counterstrik lower youngerit ok game play pug clan match

The game is smooth.The idea is great.The enemies and new encounters are faboulus.the grind is great and it has ALOT of very positive attributes to it.I personally LOVE the weapon building aspec of it.The negatives.It is ridicoulus that if you play on 2 servers you have to buy 2 battle passes. or 3 servers 3 passes.the making a character and progressing part is timeconsuming aswell. then if you like the game you probably cant invite friends because as of the time of writing my server has a low population but is LOCKED for anyone to make a new char.This means that there are numerous half empty shacks ruining the athmosphere but it also means that there are less spots for end game progression so there wont be any end game content for me.This single piece of inhibiting aspect completely RUINS the game.you cant move character. you basicly have to roll the dice and start again. HOPING it wont end up with a server with a 1000 dead spots that wont play but reserve a spot non the less. and apart from that all the grind. all the cash you put in. it does NOT follow you between servers. its character based.Based on those points i will have to give this game a big negative. if those 2 things were fixed. its a triple A,game smoothth idea greatth enemi new encount faboulusth grind great alot posit attribut iti person love weapon build aspec itth negativesit ridicoulu play server buy battl pass server passesth make charact progress part timeconsum aswel like game probabl cant invit friend time write server low popul lock anyon make new charthi mean numer half empti shack ruin athmospher also mean less spot end game progress wont end game content methi singl piec inhibit aspect complet ruin gamey cant move charact basicli roll dice start hope wont end server dead spot wont play reserv spot non less apart grind cash put follow server charact basedbas point give game big neg thing fix tripl

"The obvious souls-like references aside, something this game does that i find quite interesting; Boss fights in this game play out more like a traditional arcade fighting game, like Tekken.Bosses moves have more mixups and they tend to try and bait/trick you into trying to punish a lot of times. The moves also can be chained from their various moveset making combos you really do not anticipate. There are very few ""combo ender"" moves where you are guranteed a safe punish so most times you'll need to poke with some risks or go for a combo with major risks.As an example the Black Bear Guai, the final boss of chapter 1, has a few generic attacks that he can do such as combo A of 1-2-3 or or combo B of 1-2. At times he could use less than the combo's full string (such as combo A 1-2 but no 3). That's typical of Soulslike. However, at times, you would see something like combo A 1-2 into combo B 1-2. Another mixup of combo A 1-2-3 - pause into combo ender X (Body slam) to punish people who like to poke (You can still dodge it if your reflexes are fast enough).Sometimes there would even be combo B 1 - pause and then into combo A 1-2 - pause again to throw off the rhythm.Very rarely, the boss would spam a chain of attacks such as combo A 1-2-3 into combo B 1-2 into combo ender Y (double hand slam).It's nice to see a pretty innovative take on the soulslike fighting style as well as emphasis on boss fights as opposed to exploration/common enemies.",obviou soulslik refer asid someth game find quit interest boss fight game play like tradit arcad fight game like tekkenboss move mixup tend tri baittrick tri punish lot time move also chain variou moveset make combo realli anticip combo ender move gurante safe punish time youll need poke risk go combo major risksa exampl black bear guai final boss chapter gener attack combo combo b time could use less combo full string combo that typic soulslik howev time would see someth like combo combo b anoth mixup combo paus combo ender x bodi slam punish peopl like poke still dodg reflex fast enoughsometim would even combo b paus combo paus throw rhythmveri rare boss would spam chain attack combo combo b combo ender doubl hand slamit nice see pretti innov take soulslik fight style well emphasi boss fight oppos explorationcommon enemi

"2014 Introduction:Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a multiplayer FPS game where you are either part of a Terrorist organisation or part of a team of Counter-Terrorists. The aim of the game is to work together with your team to defeat the opposing force. Even with many new maps, weapons and features, this game still has some classic maps and guns from the older Counter Strike games.Pros:-Over 20 different weapons to choose from.-Many game modes including casual, death match, arms race, competitive and more.-Unique skins and possible drops at the end of each match.-Operations that feature new community-made maps and skins.Cons:-Trolls, hackers and smurfs can ruin a competitive match.-In general, the game does not have a very friendly/kind community.-Some in-game items/features can be quite costly.-Competitive bans may last as long as a week.Overall:CS:GO can be addictive at times and is a lot more fun when playing with friends. The graphics are nice and I personally enjoy the music/sounds. Communicating and working well with your team can be a huge advantage to the game, but there are those who prefer to stray away from the rest of their teammates and play by their own rules.

"2023 no 128 tick servers and sub tick feels terrible. What you see and what ur opponents see seems like its completely different and you end up just getting killed around corners or getting kills that you feel like you shouldn't have gotten. The animations are totally broken when players are strafing with their legs looking like their made of jelly, even after the patch that said it was suppose to be fixed. Regarding sprays sometimes i'm able to mimic the spray-downs I was able to get in csgo and other times I just end up losing track of the spray and where my bullets go. In csgo I'd see where i'm missing and make corrections mid-spray like if i'm too far to the left or something. Not sure if that's a visual thing or just how the sprays are but its just something I noticed. I also don't see the point in making a whole new game but not improving anti-cheat in anyway. It just seems really pointless.",tick server sub tick feel terribl see ur oppon see seem like complet differ end get kill around corner get kill feel like shouldnt gotten anim total broken player strafe leg look like made jelli even patch said suppos fix regard spray sometim im abl mimic spraydown abl get csgo time end lose track spray bullet go csgo id see im miss make correct midspray like im far left someth sure that visual thing spray someth notic also dont see point make whole new game improv anticheat anyway seem realli pointless

"2022 CA hasn't regained my trust after the whole Shadows of Change and literally antagonizing their community fiasco (I won't go into detail, you can look it up yourself).Right now the game is in a much better spot but CA has a lot of work to do, they really need to bring back their release system back in Warhammer 2 where they release a DLC and an FLC. When I mean FLC, I mean a proper one not a single hero unit but a WHOLE FACTION with their own unique gameplay mechanics like Imrik for the High Elves.They did something right though with their DLCs currently in which you can now buy the specific DLC for the faction you want and are not force the buy the whole bundle for a massive price.Personally I recommend the game for anyone out there looking for a good Grand Strategy game where manage an empire in turn based system and fight battles RTS style. The game offers SO MANY interesting factions to play as (if you are willing to pay the extra dollar for the previous games and dlcs).Do note that even if you're just buying Warhammer 3 alone, you literally gain access to 10 different factions to play as: 3 Kislev Faction, 2 Cathay Factions, the 4 Chaos Factions and 1 Mixed Chaos Faction. In my opinion that gives players a lot to experience and with the Sandbox Campaign unlocked you can experience the whole of the Total War Warhammer game without having to buy the 2 previous games.I still cannot recommend buying this game at full price though as CA has not re-earned my trust for that. In conclusion, good game but bad company SO BUY ON SALE",ca hasnt regain trust whole shadow chang liter antagon commun fiasco wont go detail look yourselfright game much better spot ca lot work realli need bring back releas system back warhamm releas dlc flc mean flc mean proper one singl hero unit whole faction uniqu gameplay mechan like imrik high elvesthey someth right though dlc current buy specif dlc faction want forc buy whole bundl massiv priceperson recommend game anyon look good grand strategi game manag empir turn base system fight battl rt style game offer mani interest faction play will pay extra dollar previou game dlcsdo note even your buy warhamm alon liter gain access differ faction play kislev faction cathay faction chao faction mix chao faction opinion give player lot experi sandbox campaign unlock experi whole total war warhamm game without buy previou gamesi still recommend buy game full price though ca reearn trust conclus good game bad compani buy sale

On top of that, increasing DLC prices while reducing content included. Stay away until they're building a product for the customers and not the quarterly report.Update to previous review: Immortal empires is what this game was built for, even at a beta stage it seems so much more care has been taken on the new combined campaign than the standalone.

Would Now recommend the game.Previous Review:Personally had no issues with performance at 60fps without lag spikes, the soundtrack is much better than the last one in the series and generally has a great atmosphere.

Really cool that the engine supports 8 player multiplayer campaigns now though, awesome addition!Have to not recommend getting for now, units randomly don't do what they're told to do, skirmish mode randomly comes on in the multiplayer domination, units don't path through settlements properly, campaign is just not really fun unless multiplayer.

I just took down the first boss, and I can tell this game is gonna be a banger!Wukong’s story has been retold so many times in anime and TV shows, but this is the first time it's been turned into a massive AAA game. I didn’t realize how much I missed this until now. The whole thing is dripping with nostalgia. Wukong has always been my childhood hero, way more than the classic shonen characters like Naruto or Goku.This game brings back all those memories, and I’m totally hooked. I’ve only just started playing, but I’m already looking forward to what’s next! Hail to the Monkey King!",isnt game huge achiev chines game industri took first boss tell game gon na bangerwukong stori retold mani time anim tv show first time turn massiv aaa game didnt realiz much miss whole thing drip nostalgia wukong alway childhood hero way classic shonen charact like naruto gokuthi game bring back memori im total hook ive start play im alreadi look forward what next hail monkey king

"Awesome game, environment, music, story, and combat are to perfection. Combat in general, doesn't only depend upon abilities, weapons, and builds and it's adjustable according to the player's requirements and needs, it couldn't have been more perfect than this. Even though the music is in the native language, you still vibe with it while playing the game. And graphics and environment were so beautiful that every time I went to a new area, I wanted to capture it.The story takes place after the events of the Journey to the West and the way they have narrated the whole story is marvellous. Every chapter will take you to a new area and tell a story about those who live there. Chapters 4 and 5 were the peak of the way the story unfolds.Now let's talk about the cons, chapter 6 is the weakest chapter in the whole story, and after the banger of an episode before that, I expected more. Boss fights and side bosses of the chapter are not memorable at all. But it's not the worst thing about chapter 6. The worst thing is optimization, your fps will drop considerably and come to around/below 60, and micro stutters start. They will surely patch it out later. Invisible walls are pain in the ars, devs should have could have dealt with it in different manner.I DON'T RECOMMEND if you want to 100 percent the game, as so many different items are locked behind very low rng. I killed one type of enemy around 100+ times to get random armor just for the sake of achievement and that armor wasn't even worth that grind,Overall, awesome game, definitely one of the game of the year contenders.

"2022 Note: This is my first souls-like.Elden Ring is definitly a game for people who don't like to their hands held throughout every little thing.The tutorial area is hard to miss. Pay attention and you will learn the basics of everything you need. Most will die during the tutorial but its designed to be that wayCombat:The combat is incredibly well done, unique and thrilling, incredibly challenging but very satisfying. This isn't your casual RPG like The Witcher, Skyrim or anything else you know where spamming the attack button means you get an easy win. This is not a Hack and Slash either. It's combat is so complex, every movement has to be calculated with a thought in mind of what you're gonna do.It will be hard and you will die alot, but eventually you will get over it and beat whatever gives you a hard time. That feeling of success makes the journey of dying, remembering patterns and studying every enemy so very worth it.Story: (spoiler free)The story itself, is practically nonexistant if you dont know how the Developers approached it. Most of it is told indirectly through exploring, interacting with NPC's, even hidden in Items and Cinematics. While cinematics are incredibly rare, it makes them so much more special and important.Progression:Upon leaving the starter Area you will come across little beams of Light, graces as they are called. Those are basically checkpoints where you can refill your potions, memorize new spells and level up. The golden rays around them, once discovered, lead to the next area you need to go to progress. Though, this is just to lead you to the main story. You are almost required to explore the world and find new gear to help you prepare for whats to come.I haven't finished the game but im very excited to do so. As this is my first souls-like i got a little dragged down as i kept dying alot. But as i kept going i noticed one, very important thing:The enemies dont hinder you on your journey, they are the journey.Don't give up! You will eventually have that rush of dopamine that'll make everything worth it.10/10 will attack the starter npc for calling me maidenless again.",note first soulslikeelden ring definitli game peopl dont like hand held throughout everi littl thingth tutori area hard miss pay attent learn basic everyth need die tutori design waycombatth combat incred well done uniqu thrill incred challeng satisfi isnt casual rpg like witcher skyrim anyth els know spam attack button mean get easi win hack slash either combat complex everi movement calcul thought mind your gon na doit hard die alot eventu get beat whatev give hard time feel success make journey die rememb pattern studi everi enemi worth itstori spoiler freeth stori practic nonexist dont know develop approach told indirectli explor interact npc even hidden item cinemat cinemat incred rare make much special importantprogressionupon leav starter area come across littl beam light grace call basic checkpoint refil potion memor new spell level golden ray around discov lead next area need go progress though lead main stori almost requir explor world find new gear help prepar what comei havent finish game im excit first soulslik got littl drag kept die alot kept go notic one import thingth enemi dont hinder journey journeydont give eventu rush dopamin thatll make everyth worth attack starter npc call maidenless

"Özeti baştan geçeceğim. Çok bir umudum olmadan aldığım Wukong beni gerçekten her çok şaşırttı ve bu yıl şu ana kadar oynadığım en iyi oyun oldu.Oyun oynanış olarak zaten sade ve eğlenceli ama sürekli yeni hareketler, büyüler, bürünülecek şekiller ve geliştirmeler buluyoruz ve yelpazemiz genişliyor. Genişledikçe de oyun derinleşiyor. Üstüne karşımıza çıkan her düşmanın ve özellikle de bossların farklı mekanikleri bizi sürekli yeni taktikler geliştirmeye zorluyor. Oyun çok kolay değil ama sizi cezalandıran bir zorluğu da yok ve düşmanlarınızı yenebilmeniz için her şeyi size veriyor. Oldukça hızlı olmanız gereken bir oyun ve kendine has bir ritmi var düşmanına göre değişen. Oynanış hep akıcı ve üst seviye eğlenceli. Düşmanların kafasına bütün gücünüzle geçirdiğiniz odunu çok güzel hissettiriyor oyun bize. Büyüler, eşyalar ve özelliklerde birden fazla oynamayı hakkedecek kadar geliştirilebiliyor.Haritaları başlarda küçük görünse de ilerledikçe dallanıp budaklanıyor ve genişliyor. Harita tasarımları genel olarak güzel ve bir sürü ufak tefek gizli mekan, nesne ve boss var. Kestirmeler ve gizli haritalarda buna eklenince gayet yeterli bir oyun süresi sunuyor bize dolu dolu.Oyunun zirve yaptığı yer ise sanat yönetmenliği, grafikler, müzikler, karakterlerin diyalogları, her bölümde türü değişen bölüm arası videolar her adımda mest ediyor sizi. Fare dövmeye gelmişken bir anda kendinizi kafası olmayan bir ozanın şarkılarına ritm tutarken buluyorsunuz. Mekanların büyük kısmı Çin deki tapınaklardan direkt aktarılmış veya ilham alınmış ve hepsi büyüleyici görünüyor. Karlı dağlardaki Budha heykelleriyle dolu dehlizlerden tutun, lavların arasındaki bir tapınağın işlemelerine kadar her şey olağan üstü, en ufak detaya bile özen gösterilmiş.Oyunun ""journal""i ise ayrı bir övgüyü hakkediyor. Sadece buradaki karakter hikayelerini okuyarak Çin mitolojisinin büyük kısmını öğrenebilirsiniz. Hikayeler hem eğlenceli hem de yürek dağlıyorlar. Sizi sinir eden bir düşmanın gerçek yüzünü öğrenince hafiften dumur oluyorsunuz.Başta da dediğim gibi oyun beni resmen büyüledi ve nefes almadan oynadım. Bir kaç ufak sorunu var belki ama günümüz oyunlarına göre çok komik sorunlar bunlar ve yüzlerce çalışanı olan multinasyonel firmalar bu kadar stabil oyun yapamıyorlar. Bütün içtenliğim ile her oyunsevere tavsiye ediyorum, hele ki God of War tarzı oyunları seviyorsanız. Ne yazık ki ülkemizde artık çok pahalı oyunlar ve hobimizi rahatça tavsiye edemez hale geldik ama bu yıl 1 tane oyun alacaksanız o da bu olsun.",zeti batan geeceim ok bir umudum olmadan aldm wukong beni gerekten ok artt bu yl u ana kadar oynadm en iyi oyun olduoyun oynan olarak zaten sade elenc ama srekli yeni hareketl byler brnlecek ekil gelitirmel buluyoruz yelpazemiz geniliyor geniledik de oyun derinleiyor stne karmza kan dmann zellikl de bosslarn farkl mekanikleri bizi srekli yeni taktikl gelitirmey zorluyor oyun ok kolay deil ama sizi cezalandran bir zorluu da yok dmanlarnz yenebilmeniz iin eyi size veriyor olduka hzl olmanz gereken bir oyun kendin bir ritmi var dmanna gre deien oynan hep akc st seviy elenc dmanlarn kafasna btn gcnzle geirdiiniz odunu ok gzel hissettiriyor oyun bize byler eyalar zelliklerd birden fazla oynamay hakkedecek kadar gelitirilebiliyorharitalar balarda kk grnse de ilerledik dallanp budaklanyor geniliyor harita tasarmlar genel olarak gzel bir sr ufak tefek gizli mekan nesn boss var kestirmel gizli haritalarda buna ekleninc gayet yeterli bir oyun sresi sunuyor bize dolu doluoyunun zirv yapt yer ise sanat ynetmenlii grafikl mzikler karakterlerin diyaloglar blmde tr deien blm ara videolar admda mest ediyor sizi fare dvmey gelmiken bir anda kendinizi kafa olmayan bir ozann arklarna ritm tutarken buluyorsunuz mekanlarn byk ksm deki tapnaklardan direkt aktarlm veya ilham alnm hepsi byleyici grnyor karl dalardaki budha heykelleriyl dolu dehlizlerden tutun lavlarn arasndaki bir tapnan ilemelerin kadar ey olaan st en ufak detaya bile zen gsterilmioyunun journali ise ayr bir vgi hakkediyor sadec buradaki karakt hikayelerini okuyarak mitolojisinin byk ksmn renebilirsiniz hikayel hem elenc hem de yrek dalyorlar sizi sinir eden bir dmann gerek yzn reninc hafiften dumur oluyorsunuzbata da dediim gibi oyun beni resmen byledi nefe almadan oynadm bir ka ufak sorunu var belki ama gnmz oyunlarna gre ok komik sorunlar bunlar yzlerc alan olan multinasyonel firmalar bu kadar stabil oyun yapamyorlar btn itenliim ile oyunsever tavsiy ediyorum hele ki god war tarz oyunlar seviyorsanz ne yazk ki lkemizd artk ok pahal oyunlar hobimizi rahata tavsiy edemez hale geldik ama bu yl tane oyun alacaksanz da bu olsun

"2022 First off, let me state that ive never played a Dark Souls game before, id heard about them though never took the plunge. If those games are anything like Elden Ring, I have seriously been missing out. I bought the game after watching a trailer and the concepts all sounded like a fun time. Turns out, that was an extreme understatement. If you are like me and enjoy challenging games that make you feel like you have actually worked each victory, exploration and beautiful environments I can say with 100% faith that you will love this game. My only negative is the multiplay co-op with friends. Given how difficult some bosses are, its understood that you will die a lot, so having to re-queue each time you die is a bit tedious. That is literally my only negative thing about this game. I will now end this review with these final words. ""Good Luck and Enjoy!""",first let state ive never play dark soul game id heard though never took plung game anyth like elden ring serious miss bought game watch trailer concept sound like fun time turn extrem understat like enjoy challeng game make feel like actual work victori explor beauti environ say faith love game neg multiplay coop friend given difficult boss understood die lot requeu time die bit tediou liter neg thing game end review final word good luck enjoy

"The servers for multiplayer are just plain garbage. The game itself is probably fine but I wouldn't know, an hour into a co-op campaign it becomes unplayable for my friend and I because of constant desync issues. Turns out it's real hard to fight off tyranids when the game doesn't register weapon reloads, item pick ups, even melee hits sometimes, and then when you get incapacitated and helped up, you just stand there motionless for 10 seconds. Really hope this is resolved before full release.

FOR THE EMPEROR,emperor
"2016 CS:GO a game, that forces you to blow.Counter strike global offensive, is a sequel to a game not many mention, that is the more tame and passive counter strike source, or at least by comparison. When you get CS:GO you will immediately know, that you're gonna be bad and quickly get mad. And if you aren't aware of the haulage of rage in less than a minute, your ""teammates"" will acknowledge and flip it on.Never in my life, have I been in a situation where I wanted people from another nation to be on my team. Because with most of the american players, they do nothing but add layers of irritation and stress, mostly screaming kids or random mooks making bids for weapons while ignoring their dames, when they should be playing the game, that it causes such a mess.The main game is all the same. If you're a terrorist your goal is to blow up things, like a horrible chemist. If you're a counter terrorist, you'll find yourself defending one of two spots like a minimum wage therapist. Both teams do have an alternative option, that they aren't too furtive about. Everyone usually goes for this route, and just kill everyone on the other team without a doubt. This game is not new user friendly, I dare say it is quite deadly to newbies. To sum things up, before I get mad and break a cup. It feels like everyone is a 5 year veteran, but you are some poor letterman that gets headshot instantly and spent more time dead than alive. Your accuracy is off like a dead battery, but every bullet from each enemy is specially graced by gaben to carve a mullet into your skull. It doesn't help, that this games community is rancid, if you dare yelp everyone will shout at you like you're a whelp. Not to mention the huge amount of smurfs, that make you feel like you're in detention. Don't even bother unboxing, because it is outright mocking you what little difference it makes. All you can get is a skin, which is as worthless as the bin you'll put it in. All the guns work, but apparently aren't as fun without bright colors stickers glowsticks or prickers. And don't dilude yourself that if you keep trying you'll get a knife, it'll be a very pitiful strife. And the worst part, that makes the first statement of this review meanginless? This game makes you always feel bad, I rarely see anyone glad to be having fun at all. CS:GO makes you feel like you blow. There is one thing that is a big deal to the smurfs, that they gladly take and seal. But the problem that always hits without fail is, this game is always on bloody sale. So for 40 bucks, the average chucks can have about 8 accounts. So even if they do get a ban, it'll literally be like you threw a rotten tomato at a fan. Just more of a fuss that oozes from this toxic community, like a wound full of puss.You may ask yourself, ""why does this random delph still play it then?"" The answer is simple, like connect the dots with dimples. This game has challenge, and does need ""teamwork"" to make you do better than an allonge. Which you'll rarely get alone, it cannot be done. Bring a friend, because in the end it is better to suffer together rather than alone.Otherwise can't recommend.",csgo game forc blowcount strike global offens sequel game mani mention tame passiv counter strike sourc least comparison get csgo immedi know your gon na bad quickli get mad arent awar haulag rage less minut teammat acknowledg flip onnev life situat want peopl anoth nation team american player noth add layer irrit stress mostli scream kid random mook make bid weapon ignor dame play game caus messth main game your terrorist goal blow thing like horribl chemist your counter terrorist youll find defend one two spot like minimum wage therapist team altern option arent furtiv everyon usual goe rout kill everyon team without doubt game new user friendli dare say quit deadli newbi sum thing get mad break cup feel like everyon year veteran poor letterman get headshot instantli spent time dead aliv accuraci like dead batteri everi bullet enemi special grace gaben carv mullet skull doesnt help game commun rancid dare yelp everyon shout like your whelp mention huge amount smurf make feel like your detent dont even bother unbox outright mock littl differ make get skin worthless bin youll put gun work appar arent fun without bright color sticker glowstick pricker dont dilud keep tri youll get knife itll piti strife worst part make first statement review meanginless game make alway feel bad rare see anyon glad fun csgo make feel like blow one thing big deal smurf gladli take seal problem alway hit without fail game alway bloodi sale buck averag chuck account even get ban itll liter like threw rotten tomato fan fuss ooz toxic commun like wound full pussyou may ask random delph still play answer simpl like connect dot dimpl game challeng need teamwork make better allong youll rare get alon done bring friend end better suffer togeth rather aloneotherwis cant recommend

Combat feels terrible compared to the first game. Especially the melee. You pretty much just wanna spam dodge and parry. Because otherwise even the small enemies will momentarily stun you. It's just so frustratingly tedious. Because of this each mission feels very samey and unsatisfying. Since you're now a Primaris Space Marine. Customization is more limited thanks to the fact Primaris only have the one mark of armor. Where as in the first game you could choose different Marks of power armor. Weapons are still the same ones from the original game. But some them feel less satisfying than they had in that game. It just doesn't feel like a fun game.,combat feel terribl compar first game especi mele pretti much wan na spam dodg parri otherwis even small enemi momentarili stun frustratingli tediou mission feel samey unsatisfi sinc your primari space marin custom limit thank fact primari one mark armor first game could choos differ mark power armor weapon still one origin game feel less satisfi game doesnt feel like fun game

The concept is great, but in reality they're clearly struggling to implement it, and things have gone downhill since the TW:W2 days.

Game-breaking bugs still occur. And now we're getting LL DLC packs at $25, when completely new factions only used to cost $20. It almost feels as though CA are fed up of their own game and are self-destructing, because they're either not putting enough thought into their prices, or not enough effort into their DLCs.

"I've played Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 3 but never completed them. Elden Ring is my first FromSoft game I have gone far in and even defeated Melania. This game is fun but the boss designs are disrespectfully poorly designed. Like utter garbage when you compare it to Sekiro or Souls bosses. In previous games they were difficult yes, but they were fair. I felt accomplished when overcoming hurdles and felt rewarded. In Elden Ring when you defeat something you are just glad it's over. Sad really. Only bosses I felt was amazing was Godfrey, Radahn and Melania. It might sound like I hate this game but I love it, it's healthy to criticize games you love. I realized why it feels more RNG and why the bosses just feel like they have too many cheese. It's because I refused to use the tools that are available. I beat Melania without a summon and with a pure Dex katana build out of pride that ""I have to beat her without a summon/no magic"". Elden Ring is not Dark Souls, the bosses will cheese you and it will be RNG sometimes. But use what the game gives you, level past 150, use summons, cracked pots, respec, mage, cheese builds, etc. Be resourceful because sometimes, pure builds just get ♥♥♥♥ on with the bosses in Elden Ring.

"2022 Let me preface my recommendation with this: This game in its current state is recommended for enfranchised players of the Warhammer series. At this time I wouldn’t recommend it for newer players or even historical players who have jot played the previous two games. I’ll also preface that at this point I have just completed the tutorial campaign and I am 20 turns into a Demon Prince campaign, so I won’t talk about anything beyond that scope.My specs:Geforce RTX 3070Ryzen 5 5600x 3.4ghz8GB DDR4 RAMI play at 1440p on a curved monitor.The good: The game contains a number of important quality of life improvements from the last game. Aside from the well discussed battle and campaign features that have solved problems we both knew we had and some which we didn’t know we had until they fixed them, CA have clearly learned the importance of having each faction be mechanically unique. Further, the tutorial campaign is exceptionally good, both as a narrative and an onboarding experience.I’ve seen a lot of people criticising graphics. For me, graphically, the game is an improvement from Warhammer particularly in unit detail and effects. I made a point to have a close look at WoC units to compare. I understand that some people criticise the change in visual style on the campaign map, with some finding it to be an overly simplified look. This is not a technical issue therefore, it is an artistic question. I personally prefer this style - perhaps it is playing on a higher resolution screen, but I am finding the campaign world a lot more immersive - in the previous games the campaign map was very homogenous per each region - whereas within one specific region in this game local areas feel a lot more diverse.The bad:For all the positive qol changes, sadly there are some things which have actually led to a quality of life decrease. Of particular note are the unit placement highlights and orders, which on the white snow background seem to be almost invisible. I find this extremely surprising that this has not been addressed before release. Unit order legibility is honestly one of the most important parts of managing battles so I sincerely hope they do something to make them stand out against the snow, which is a very common sight in this game.There are issues currently with running the game at 1440p and if you try to run it windowed you will find the top of the screen cut off - there is no screen safe space adjustment option so your only choice is to run full screen. I hope these issues will be addressed post haste.Conclusion:As stated in my preface, this review is based on a small time playing. Overall the issues I have faced have not been massively impactful and I am enjoying the game immensely. Still I hope these issues are addressed as soon as possible.",let prefac recommend game current state recommend enfranchis player warhamm seri time wouldnt recommend newer player even histor player jot play previou two game ill also prefac point complet tutori campaign turn demon princ campaign wont talk anyth beyond scopemi specsgeforc rtx rami play curv monitorth good game contain number import qualiti life improv last game asid well discuss battl campaign featur solv problem knew didnt know fix ca clearli learn import faction mechan uniqu tutori campaign except good narr onboard experienc seen lot peopl criticis graphic graphic game improv warhamm particularli unit detail effect made point close look woc unit compar understand peopl criticis chang visual style campaign map find overli simplifi look technic issu therefor artist question person prefer style perhap play higher resolut screen find campaign world lot immers previou game campaign map homogen per region wherea within one specif region game local area feel lot diverseth badfor posit qol chang sadli thing actual led qualiti life decreas particular note unit placement highlight order white snow background seem almost invis find extrem surpris address releas unit order legibl honestli one import part manag battl sincer hope someth make stand snow common sight gamether issu current run game tri run window find top screen cut screen safe space adjust option choic run full screen hope issu address post hasteconclusiona state prefac review base small time play overal issu face massiv impact enjoy game immens still hope issu address soon possibl
"2018 I've been playing CS:GO for almost a week ;) now and I have to say it's a lot of fun, especially playing a round with school friends in the evening is always fun. Many people like to complain about bad randoms or too many hackers (or smurfs where everyone is a cheater kills one, makes sense) - I can only agree with that to a certain extent.CS:GO is a team game and therefore you need good teamplay / a team, so please queue with a few friends or stop being toxic like a pig and make friends with your random teammates, that's also possible!Since I have most of the time a green trust (drops from time to time on yellow because of too much writing in the chat, apparently Valve does not filter that therefore you are simply muted after X chat abuse reports and downgraded to yellow trust, perfect system Volvo) so I hardly get cheaters and also rarely Smurfs in my game.Finally, I can recommend CS:GO to everyone, if you lose too many games or no longer have fun helps a break - or just play with Premades ;).Good luck and have fun in the Rankeds, don't freak out too much at the end of the day it's also about having fun!:)",ive play csgo almost week say lot fun especi play round school friend even alway fun mani peopl like complain bad random mani hacker smurf everyon cheater kill one make sens agre certain extentcsgo team game therefor need good teamplay team pleas queue friend stop toxic like pig make friend random teammat that also possiblesinc time green trust drop time time yellow much write chat appar valv filter therefor simpli mute x chat abus report downgrad yellow trust perfect system volvo hardli get cheater also rare smurf gamefin recommend csgo everyon lose mani game longer fun help break play premad good luck fun rank dont freak much end day also fun
"2022 The ""Positive Review"" DLC can be purchased for: $463.59* *This is the approximate cost of the game plus all DLC, and the previous 2 games and their DLC. Loyalty is expensive. You lost yours Creative Assembly.As an addendum, Yes I own the game and almost all of the DLC. But this has been purchased over several years of being a loyal consumer. Their more recent practices and corporate policy have been less than agreeable and is why I have made this negative review. I love this game, I want to see it thrive and I want to see more people play it. But the barrier to entry is too steep and I cannot get any friends to join me in this game. That paired with this recent price trending for DLC that lack content, and their handling of staff, customers, and reviewers/content creators, leave a horribly bitter taste in my mouth.CA; Please do better. I want to go back to loving this game and your work. I want to share it with my friends and loved ones. But you need to meet us in the middle.Update: The recent updates to the game have seen some improvement. But the review stands at negative simply because they have not addressed the financial barrier to entry for newcomers. I'd suggest making bigger packs with larger discounts bundling different things. Say, ""The Skaven Bundle"", or ""The Lizardmen Bundle"" ""The Chaos Bundle"". Bundles with better prices that unlock entire factions rather than the old system of 1-2 lords of X and Y faction at a time. That or perhaps a bundle that includes all the DLC from TW:WH1, with another that bundles all the DLC from TW:WH2, including the base games factions.

"Might be the first time where negative reviews actually made me buy a game. No open world Great—Not every game needs to have an open, fully explorable world. I'd much rather have a linear experience in beautifully crafted environments, which this game has. Honestly, there's much exploring to do, and it's always worthwhile. No map! I would never have expected this to be an actual complaint. This game gives me flashbacks to the late '90s and early 2000s, where you actually play a game and don't get directions spoon-fed. You have to use your eyes and recognize where you've been and where you can still go. It's what makes exploration fun and worthwhile. Backtracking through areas to see if you missed anything. It's an endless boss rush, kill a few mobs and the next boss is in sight Again—How is this a negative? The boss fights are the reason we play this genre of games. I'm amazed at how much love and attention has been put into each boss. They all have gorgeous visuals and fun, engaging movesets. No diversity and inclusion! I find diversity, equality, and inclusion important topics. However, not every game needs it. Some games have a good place and fit for it, like Baldur's Gate 3, which does it very well. However, this is a mythological game where you play as a monkey and beat up rats, lizards, and the like.This is one of the few games in the last few years where I'm having a blast playing. It feels like a mix between God of War and Monster Hunter in a Souls-like sauce. The game is hard enough to be challenging but easy enough to craft your own build without googling for strong and effective builds.",might first time neg review actual made buy game open world greatnot everi game need open fulli explor world id much rather linear experi beauti craft environ game honestli there much explor alway worthwhil map would never expect actual complaint game give flashback late earli actual play game dont get direct spoonf use eye recogn youv still go make explor fun worthwhil backtrack area see miss anyth endless boss rush kill mob next boss sight againhow neg boss fight reason play genr game im amaz much love attent put boss gorgeou visual fun engag moveset divers inclus find divers equal inclus import topic howev everi game need game good place fit like baldur gate well howev mytholog game play monkey beat rat lizard likethi one game last year im blast play feel like mix god war monster hunter soulslik sauc game hard enough challeng easi enough craft build without googl strong effect build

"This game has to be one of the worst chinese games to ever release in the west. The game feels so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shallow. There is no depth to anything except 40 million tooltips and infinite things you have to craft to make one thing. The game truly feels like an unfinished mod for PUBG. Do not play it. The game feels very catered towards the chinese market, and even one of my chinese friends say they get better games than this. All of those videos youve seen telling you the game is awesome have been sponsored and paid for by the devs. They are lying. There is no immersion. There is no challenge. Almost every single area of the game feels flawed.

"2022 To preface, I am not a Dark Souls or Bloodborne purist and haven't even put that many hours into any From Software game before Elden Ring. That being said, I now want to go back and play the Dark Souls trilogy from start to finish just to experience the story and see how it plays into the Elden Ring universe since it has been eluded that it could or may.Elden Ring is the best RPG I've played in years. The game starts with a sharp learning curve that is both unforgiving and not completely clear in the direction you should work through the game in even with the grace items that give you clues, but that is, in part, a portion of the appeal and fascinating evolution of how the game draws you in. Above all else, the underlying story and characters are engaging and make you want to continue pushing on even as your patience and temper are tested throughout. The difficulty of the game can be overcome through trial and error, but can also be supplemented with grinding out more levels and learning the crafting system to strengthen and enhance your weapons.Having not spent long hours in From Software games before Elden Ring I had to learn the timings and overall strategy that you must apply in every fight as this game does not forgive any type of button mashing and will punish you for each mistake you make when fighting enemies that could be 5, 10 or 50 times the size of your character. You learn what ""iframes"" are and how some animations will prevent you from taking damage, you learn how the longer you hold the button for your ""strong"" attacks, the more likely you are to get hit, but the greater the damage potential. You learn that parrying and counters are an essential play mechanic and that you cannot brute strength your way through the game and you must apply a level of finesse that is frustratingly cruel at times, but amazingly rewarding when you finally complete the mission or fell the boss at hand.Having played many other 1st & 3rd person RPGs, Elden Ring is the game I wish so many before it actually were. Specifically, I've indulged in the entire Elder Scrolls series except for the very first game, Arena, so I have thousands of hours in the series. As great as the evolution of the series is, story-wise, the gameplay actually declined over the course of the series rather than improved, even with the deployment of newer technologies and engines. In fact, the latest installment was, in many ways, a disappointment in terms of the play difficulty, story telling and the lack of time spent on developing the NPCs and driving factors. When you compare this to what Elden Ring is it's clear that From Software is extremely talented in staying focused on what matters and developing the gameplay and story to craft a universe that you not only want to be a part of, but also want to continue learning and digging through.With all that being said, Elden Ring is not a perfect game and there is definitely room for improvement; the lack of cut scenes and the reusing of them at key points in the game was disappointing. The game could have been greatly enhanced by adding more meaningful cinematics and not leaving so much up to the imagination. There definitely are pros and cons with this approach, but for a game of this caliber I would expect a more complete cinematic element, particularly at key points in the game where you overcome main bosses, make discoveries about characters that can come as a huge surprise and develop the story to your own path that makes the story all your own. The only other part of the game I find is lacking other than the cinematics is the focus on developing the story nearly exclusively through item descriptions. Although this is fairly unique in how you learn the more obscure details, the fact that you basically have to grind out for items with an extremely tiny drop rate to find those complementary tidbits, I wish there were other ways that the story was elaborated upon similar to other RPGs where lore is weaved throughout and doesn't just appear in an item drop.The only other criticism I have found within the game is that there is no truly enjoyable way to play as a physical ranged character and that the lack of ranged weapons tends to leave the game in a balance between magic & melee, which itself leaves a huge amount of content choices for any character development, but with only really a ""2 pronged"" weapon/class choice balancing act it does narrow down the way you play the game. Regardless this is minor in my eyes and is something that could be shored up in a DLC/expansion or in a sequel that makes the weapon choices slightly more dynamic between melee, magic and ranged.Overall I would say that even if you never played a Dark Souls title, Bloodborne, Demonsouls or any other From Software title, but want a challenging, infinitely fun and dynamic RPG that focuses on true gameplay and a story, then I would profoundly recommend Elden Ring. With the historical elements of the lore developed with the help of George R. R. Martin (Game of Thrones), the intertwining paths of the characters and their fates was amazingly interesting, creepy, diabolical, sad, enraging, thoughtful and yet still left room for even more emotions depending on what you discover on your first play through. The fact that you can then choose to play the main story again, and again, and again, evolving the difficulty to your own desire is a great complement that allows you to relive the ups and downs to your own expectations without needing to start a brand new character.TL;DR, it's the best action RPG of a human generation and there won't be another game that comes close to it until From Software teams up with a company like BioWare to integrate a more dynamic end game experience.",prefac dark soul bloodborn purist havent even put mani hour softwar game elden ring said want go back play dark soul trilog start finish experi stori see play elden ring univers sinc elud could mayelden ring best rpg ive play year game start sharp learn curv unforgiv complet clear direct work game even grace item give clue part portion appeal fascin evolut game draw els underli stori charact engag make want continu push even patienc temper test throughout difficulti game overcom trial error also supplement grind level learn craft system strengthen enhanc weaponshav spent long hour softwar game elden ring learn time overal strategi must appli everi fight game forgiv type button mash punish mistak make fight enemi could time size charact learn ifram anim prevent take damag learn longer hold button strong attack like get hit greater damag potenti learn parri counter essenti play mechan brute strength way game must appli level finess frustratingli cruel time amazingli reward final complet mission fell boss handhav play mani person rpg elden ring game wish mani actual specif ive indulg entir elder scroll seri except first game arena thousand hour seri great evolut seri storywis gameplay actual declin cours seri rather improv even deploy newer technolog engin fact latest instal mani way disappoint term play difficulti stori tell lack time spent develop npc drive factor compar elden ring clear softwar extrem talent stay focus matter develop gameplay stori craft univers want part also want continu learn dig throughwith said elden ring perfect game definit room improv lack cut scene reus key point game disappoint game could greatli enhanc ad meaning cinemat leav much imagin definit pro con approach game calib would expect complet cinemat element particularli key point game overcom main boss make discoveri charact come huge surpris develop stori path make stori part game find lack cinemat focu develop stori nearli exclus item descript although fairli uniqu learn obscur detail fact basic grind item extrem tini drop rate find complementari tidbit wish way stori elabor upon similar rpg lore weav throughout doesnt appear item dropth critic found within game truli enjoy way play physic rang charact lack rang weapon tend leav game balanc magic mele leav huge amount content choic charact develop realli prong weaponclass choic balanc act narrow way play game regardless minor eye someth could shore dlcexpans sequel make weapon choic slightli dynam mele magic rangedoveral would say even never play dark soul titl bloodborn demonsoul softwar titl want challeng infinit fun dynam rpg focus true gameplay stori would profoundli recommend elden ring histor element lore develop help georg r r martin game throne intertwin path charact fate amazingli interest creepi diabol sad enrag thought yet still left room even emot depend discov first play fact choos play main stori evolv difficulti desir great complement allow reliv up down expect without need start brand new charactertldr best action rpg human gener wont anoth game come close softwar team compani like biowar integr dynam end game experi

"I played the entire game on the Steam Deck. It ran 30 FPS consistently in almost all areas in the map. The game graphical settings were all set to low and FSR Frame generation OFF (this setting crashed the game after the intro battle but it was fixed in a recent patch, still I wouldn't recommend playing with this enabled). Every chapter ran good except chapter 3. The more you play the game the more the game lags (it's weird to explain but you'll know once you play it yourself). This ""accumulation"" of lag was the worst in chapter 3. My deck froze 2 times in chapter 3 alone (but not consequently, I returned to chapter 3 area a lot for other side missions).

This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

"2022 As a writer, Elden Ring is a modern masterpiece, even today with major releases that are stronger than ever. More games seem to take on the pseudo-genre of souls-like but never really capture well... the soul of Dark Souls. Releasing in 2011 the game stands the test of time, remaining a work of genius with unrivaled mechanics and stunning visuals. Even better is the superb storytelling and wonderous writing featuring inspiring interconnectivity that is unbelievably unparalleled. The world was hand crafted by the savants at FromSoft, a publisher I would buy used toilet paper from they are so good, Lordran is some of their best work to date. The map design is master-craft with no crevice overlooked, it's the model of perfection and gamers still have yet to see anything else quite like it. Some don't see it at all because of the difficulty which turns so many gamers away but that makes the combat system the most satisfying known to gamers and gaming. It's so difficult it would turn even the most pathetic incel into a Christian chad! With that difficulty comes some of the most iconic boss fights in gaming (not to mention the rock solid waifus, lookin' at you Queelag). As you are trapped in a life or death struggle against the bosses of Lordran you can feel the passion of the developers have for their game, encapsulating their blood sweat and tears with masterful theming and some of the most unique character designs to come out of gaming. To the player one of the best feelings in the game has to be standing triumphant over a boss you threw yourself at over and over again. It's such a privilege to watch your character progress, it really makes you feel like a dark soul.Even renowned novelist H.P. Lovecraft and the late Ghandi have praised Dark Souls for its vastly superior technical prowess, character design and story telling. It was and still is a groundbreaking and innovative game that gamers everywhere absolutely MUST play. Not to mention haunting the musical score which made me YEET my pants. Simply put Dark Souls is G.O.A.T all year every year as an unparalleled gaming experience that has spawned its own genre and inspired so many story writers such as myself. After all, what do we say about the Mona Lisa in 2019? Still a masterpiece?

"2023 I've been playing Total War for a while now. Every so often the devs drop the ball and get a little greedy, a little lazy, or both, it happens. The community reminds them why the money flows and we move on. This time feels different. Ever since WH3 came out things have not been as expected. More bugs, less content, less transparency, higher prices. WH3 launched in a sorry state, they made it slightly better over a long period but nobody cared much because we were all waiting for Immortal Empires, the mode that would turn the Total War: WARHAMMER trilogy into a magnum opus.The mode came and it was busted. Bugs, balance, design, all far below what is acceptable or fun. Even for these devs it was a bad look. I took a break, willing to wait for them to polish up Immortal Empires so I could come back and play the game as It should be. This is an ambitious game, I thought, give them some time. I come back many months later expecting to play a better game and am shocked to see that not only has very little improved, but the devs got it into their head that it was time to press their luck. The upcoming Shadows of Change DLC will have both less content and cost way more than usual.

"2022 Need some serious work right now. Spent a bunch of time with this game and found some many minor things wrong with this game. Went back to WH2 and I was like ""wow."" WH2 did so many thing right and WH3 just forgot about it. It almost like they took a old WH1 build and just added a bunch of new things to it. As of right now, I can't recommend this game. I love WH2 and this game was a disappointment. I like the life improvement, but what the point of them if the game is not fun. The campaign SUCK! It feel like a copy and paste for each faction. Even the cut scene feel like a copy of each other. They follow the same layout with a few line difference. The old man go to a faction, make a deal where the faction you are playing either want to kill him or don't believe him, he only ask for a drop of blood, and then without even thinking about how they wanted to kill him before, they take his offer on. Now normally I wouldn't care about this, but it is the fact that this happens a lot. This copy and paste of units, story, and game mechanic is so lame. What is CA obsession with harpy like creatures and wolves? There are so many variation of the same units and they suck mid-late game. I also truly hate the new supply system. It fine in minor settlement, but major settlement suck. In the grand campaign, it was fun playing chaos once. After that it became annoying. I can keep going, but then this will only be a rant. Bottom line, it need some serious work. The biggest problem? CA decided to took out the fun like the magic system or how units use to fight so much better in favor of a faster pace game. It was like night and day difference playing WH2 again after playing WH3. For now, don't buy this game, let just hope CA get their act together and make their game FUN. If you like the game great for you, but I think the other review by other people speaks for themselves. We just want CA to fix the game.",need seriou work right spent bunch time game found mani minor thing wrong game went back like wow mani thing right forgot almost like took old build ad bunch new thing right cant recommend game love game disappoint like life improv point game fun campaign suck feel like copi past faction even cut scene feel like copi follow layout line differ old man go faction make deal faction play either want kill dont believ ask drop blood without even think want kill take offer normal wouldnt care fact happen lot copi past unit stori game mechan lame ca obsess harpi like creatur wolv mani variat unit suck midlat game also truli hate new suppli system fine minor settlement major settlement suck grand campaign fun play chao becam annoy keep go rant bottom line need seriou work biggest problem ca decid took fun like magic system unit use fight much better favor faster pace game like night day differ play play dont buy game let hope ca get act togeth make game fun like game great think review peopl speak want ca fix game
"One the greatest games ever to exist. Ive never had such a hard time coming up with words to explain a fantastic game, a fully fleshed completed game on release. A great story that gave me chills and had me giggling like a child while watching the most badass cutscenes Ive ever seen in a game. The game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beautiful, every location and level was designed perfectly. to fit the mood and set the scene. With the addition of operations to see another side of the story with your own customizable character. The armor customization is pristine, being able to adjust every piece of armor to mix and match different chapter armors with every armor piece have its own color scheme. The attention to detail is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ phenomenal while playing through the story there is so much going on in the background that most wont notice, my friends and I spent a lot of time standing around watching battles from afar or listening to the dialogues from NPCs.

"2023 THE RUINATION AND TOTAL MISHANDLING OF ONE OF THE BEST GAME SERIES!!!All they had to do was release a mostly bug free release and keep pumping out good DLC, same as they had with TWWH 1&2 and they would still have the goodwill and faith of the community and more importantly raked in Billions in revenue........TLDR New DLC Pricing is a rip off and makes this game a pass until it and all dlc are 50-75% offThe first Total War Warhammer game was a expensive but great game that was good enough to justify even the price of the multitudes of DLC, the second game built on the first and soared to new heights especially after opening up and massively improving the modding potential which allowed for an entire sea of mods, many of which had better mechanics and quality than the official DLC (especially Mixus lords, some of which were legit better than CAs versions of the same lords) despite the amazing modding community the countless still expensive but great DLC were still worth it and sold like hot cakes.by the time they left development of the second game Ca had an mountain of good will and faith from the community despite individuals like me having had to spend in the high hundreds of dollars on the series so far to enjoy the full experience.All of which they somehow burnt up in smoke, TWWHIII on release was a mess, I will gloss over the countless major bugs that we seem to expect these days from AAA, the only map had countless mechanical issues and campaign design was terrible for many factions, they overhauled Multiplayer and improved much of the previously painful experience, yet they still left many of the old issues like in custom battles being very restricted on number of sides and configuration of players between each. also faction DLC on release, really? just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ manipulating gamers perception to make more money is not a good start to the game.despite all these issues and countless more most people including me still had faith that with time and DLC the game would fix itself and soar to even greater heights than any before. all they had to do was devote devs to the game and it would print money faster than a american national bank.Instead development was painfully slow and seemingly put on the back burner by CA, eventually bugs went away and we got Immortal empires that passed over many of the issues with the old map and things seemed to be looking uphill, then Chaos Dwarves happened, or more its price did, probably the best DLC in the series yet but at a massively marked up price (half price of the full game WTF) which wouldn't have been as painful if it was the only DLC, but in top of the $$$ most people already have invested in this franchise its just way too much but at least it was a great faction and had an excuse.But the insanity that broke the hydras back is the latest DLC the Shadows of Change for the same already high price as one of the best factions yet we get 3 lords 11 units and 9 regiments of renown which is an absolute rip off, a team of a dozen modders could do that in just over a week, and they charge half the price of the full AAA game, WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL!!!and the worst of it is future DLC will probably be the same price or more, if this is what 3 lords costs what will a faction cost in the future? and bear in mind being the final game in the series if they dont drive away the rest of the consumers it could have 20-30 such DLC, were talking potentially in the thousands of $$$, not to mention the already massive investments in the previous games.If you made it this far then you have my condolences. and ♥♥♥♥ CA, there treatment of this game has turned the same as every other AAA developer",ruinat total mishandl one best game seriesal releas mostli bug free releas keep pump good dlc twwh would still goodwil faith commun importantli rake billion revenuetldr new dlc price rip make game pass dlc offth first total war warhamm game expens great game good enough justifi even price multitud dlc second game built first soar new height especi open massiv improv mod potenti allow entir sea mod mani better mechan qualiti offici dlc especi mixu lord legit better ca version lord despit amaz mod commun countless still expens great dlc still worth sold like hot cakesbi time left develop second game ca mountain good faith commun despit individu like spend high hundr dollar seri far enjoy full experienceal somehow burnt smoke twwhiii releas mess gloss countless major bug seem expect day aaa map countless mechan issu campaign design terribl mani faction overhaul multiplay improv much previous pain experi yet still left mani old issu like custom battl restrict number side configur player also faction dlc releas realli manipul gamer percept make money good start gamedespit issu countless peopl includ still faith time dlc game would fix soar even greater height devot dev game would print money faster american nation bankinstead develop pain slow seemingli put back burner ca eventu bug went away got immort empir pass mani issu old map thing seem look uphil chao dwarv happen price probabl best dlc seri yet massiv mark price half price full game wtf wouldnt pain dlc top peopl alreadi invest franchis way much least great faction excusebut insan broke hydra back latest dlc shadow chang alreadi high price one best faction yet get lord unit regiment renown absolut rip team dozen modder could week charg half price full aaa game actual helland worst futur dlc probabl price lord cost faction cost futur bear mind final game seri dont drive away rest consum could dlc talk potenti thousand mention alreadi massiv invest previou gamesif made far condol ca treatment game turn everi aaa develop

"2022 Total War Warhammer III Total War Warhammer III is an epic conclusion to the Total War Warhammer trilogy. Though the main campaign ""Chaos Realms"" may be slightly disappointing the massive update that many of us have waited is finnaly here. Tthe Immortal Empire update combining content from previous Warhammer games into one big sandbox campaign and with promise of support for coming years by CA and amazing support with mods by the community one thing is certain. This is best and definitive Total War Warhammer Fantasy experience. Pros: + Immortal Empire+ Addictive, one more turn syndrome+ Good soundtrack + Steam workshop support ( mods ) + Dozens of unique lords, units, and mechanics for each race+ Game for many, many hours... + Sieges are upgraded finally. Though they are not perfect still.. they are for sure better from what we had in previous Warhammer games Cons: - Chaos Realm campaign it's mixed expierence. Mostly because of annoying mechanics ""Chaos Gates""- New missions/battle type: the survival one that let you fight againsta few waves of enemies. Though sounded cool on paper, in game experience it's just not fun.- Missing blood and gore it's still outrageous. Yeah there's dlc for it, but that's just pure heresy.- Diplomacy could use some major upgrade.

"Gonna be completely honest, after the first 30 minutes of optimization hell, I am safe to say that the early trials were worth it. A story that sticks to the core of 40k, the beautiful, immersive set pieces. This is THE 40k game I've been waiting for. The combat system has taken some time to get used to, but there's nothing more satisfying than pulling off a chain of executions and heavy hitting slams into the horde that surrounds you (before you turn the entire place into a red mist). And it's not just the melee. The ranged weapons have the most satisfying bolter punches I've seen in a 40k game yet. The multiplayer PVP mode could use some balancing, and the campaign AI really needs a tweak or two, but this is something that nobody is a stranger to at this point. It's an expected headache when you make gameplay surrounding co-op and then give us robots with the brains of a sloth to back us up.I accidentally purchased the early access pre-order, but as far as I'm concerned, it's been worth every penny, and will be for a long time to come.

"I am on my fifth playthrough now and I cannot stop playing it lol. Ever since Sekiro, I have been looking for a game that is challenging with satisfying combat experiences. Elden Ring was fun but the combat is just not as interactive and satisfying as Sekiro. And now with Black Myth: Wukong, I have finally found another game that gives such satisfying combat experiences. I would even say this game actually excels Sekiro in some aspects. I love how fast-paced the combats are, and being aggressive is actually beneficial just like Sekiro. In addition, the fact there are so many spells, spirits, transformations, stances, equipment skills available adds variety to the combat experiences. There are so many different playstyle or build to choose from and you can change your build any time. Even at my fifth playthrough, I am still discovering new ways to play the game. My favorite thing to do is to switch stances mid-battle and see-through counter with different varied combos (so satisfying when pulling it off). On top of the move variety, no two bosses are the same and every fight is just incredibly cinematic. For people looking to start souls-like games, I would recommend starting with this one. This game is much more forgiving and easy to get into compared to actual souls games.

2023 Fun game but not worth it. There's too many dlcs to buy for a full price game. The army rosters are barebone without faction dlc. Your paying for the game already but more than half the lords and units are locked behind a dlc. If the game was 10$ then yea I'll buy 15$ and 20$ dlcs but nope. Basically paying for half a game and they are asking you to fork over more money.

"2022 CS2 grapples with a toxic player community, a deficient anti-cheat system, encountering cheaters every three matches, a shortage of casual game modes, the absence of a 128-tick rate, and the implementation of a questionable 64-tick system called ""subtick."" Additionally, the game is plagued by peeker advantages, ultimately overshadowing the once-dominant CS2 experience.On a somewhat brighter note, the game boasts nice graphics, though it seems that people don't flock to CS2 for its visual appeal.In conclusion, CS2's drawbacks, including its problematic player base, ineffective anti-cheat measures, cheater prevalence, limited game modes, tick rate issues, and peeker disadvantages, cast a shadow over what was once a standout gaming experience.

"2015 (Update 24th of december)It's just not what it's used to be anymore..Community:COD was most likely known for the game with the most toxic community full of kids, but since cod got worse a lot of kids came to csgo and here is the problem. The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the ass. Competetive:I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or 2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.Elo system:Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global! Skins:A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game. Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver?Oh also. Save your ''just because you're silver'' comments okay?

"2022 Let me start by saying the game is good! If you buy this game, you most likely will enjoy your first campaign if you enjoyed your first vortex campaign from game 2. They have added a bunch of QoL improvements and changes that I find pleasing.The negative reviews are due to a few things (which are legitimate) like the bugs, the lack of replayability, and comparisons of this brand new game to the masterpiece that was the second game of the trilogy. I felt the need to leave this review to give greater context to the negative reviews. People are comparing this brand new game to game 2 which has had years of tweaks and DLC to flesh it out to it's greatest potential. Game 3 is brand new, no DLC other than the day 1 pre-order bonus, no mortal empires, fresh bugs, etc. It is a bit unfair to compared game 3 at launch to game 2 at it's peak. Game 2 at launch did not have mortal empires and only had a fraction of the playable races/lords available as they do now. In time, game 3 will likely surpass the popularity of 2, but it will take time for the Devs to add in Immortal empires (sandbox mode), new lords/factions and patch bugs. I do think this game was the best of the 3 on release day, but WH2 with all the DLC and updates is currently the superior product (unless you've played it to death and are bored of playing).The Warhammer games rarely ever go on sale, so I would suggest picking it up and enjoying a campaign or two now and when you get bored, put it down until they come out with new updates, especially the immortal empires update which is coming later this year. That should add a bunch of replayability that currently isn't here for a lot of people who dislike the souls race and don't feel like installing any mods to remove that objective from the game. The current factions already offer up a bunch of differing campaign mechanics to keep things fresh for me personally but your mileage may vary. This game gets two thumbs up from me because I know it will get better over time like the first and second games did and I had fun with what they released on Day 1.",let start say game good buy game like enjoy first campaign enjoy first vortex campaign game ad bunch qol improv chang find pleasingth neg review due thing legitim like bug lack replay comparison brand new game masterpiec second game trilog felt need leav review give greater context neg review peopl compar brand new game game year tweak dlc flesh greatest potenti game brand new dlc day preorder bonu mortal empir fresh bug etc bit unfair compar game launch game peak game launch mortal empir fraction playabl raceslord avail time game like surpass popular take time dev add immort empir sandbox mode new lordsfact patch bug think game best releas day dlc updat current superior product unless youv play death bore playingth warhamm game rare ever go sale would suggest pick enjoy campaign two get bore put come new updat especi immort empir updat come later year add bunch replay current isnt lot peopl dislik soul race dont feel like instal mod remov object game current faction alreadi offer bunch differ campaign mechan keep thing fresh person mileag may vari game get two thumb know get better time like first second game fun releas day

"The game features a vast, open world called the Lands Between, filled with diverse landscapes, hidden secrets, and challenging enemies. The world design encourages exploration and discovery. Elden Ring retains the challenging and rewarding combat mechanics of FromSoftware's previous titles, such as Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. Players can choose from various weapons, spells, and abilities to suit their playstyle.The game offers extensive character customization options, including classes, stats, equipment, and abilities. Players can tailor their characters to their preferred combat style. True to FromSoftware's style, Elden Ring features numerous challenging and memorable boss fights that require strategy, skill, and patience. The game’s story is co-written by Hidetaka Miyazaki and fantasy author George R.R. Martin. It features a rich, intricate lore with deep world-building elements. Like previous FromSoftware games, the story is presented in a fragmented manner, encouraging players to piece together the narrative through exploration, dialogue, and item descriptions.",game featur vast open world call land fill divers landscap hidden secret challeng enemi world design encourag explor discoveri elden ring retain challeng reward combat mechan fromsoftwar previou titl dark soul bloodborn sekiro player choos variou weapon spell abil suit playstyleth game offer extens charact custom option includ class stat equip abil player tailor charact prefer combat style true fromsoftwar style elden ring featur numer challeng memor boss fight requir strategi skill patienc game stori cowritten hidetaka miyazaki fantasi author georg rr martin featur rich intric lore deep worldbuild element like previou fromsoftwar game stori present fragment manner encourag player piec togeth narr explor dialogu item descript

Warhammer 2 was an amazing game and any improvement on that is welcome, but when you are charging a hefty price plus DLC, it's hard to call the improvement we got as good enough. There have even been some steps back that the community has been very vocal about, it's the sieges, they were already a very weak part of the game and they have just been made more complex in an attempt to make them more fun. The larger immortal empires map size and new factions have been great, but Warhammer 3 is a whole new game, a whole new game that feels like warhammer 2 with a few major content updates/DLC and some quality-of-life mods.",put lot time warhamm excit warhamm sinc launch definit improv warhamm quit improv mani peopl want warhamm amaz game improv welcom charg hefti price plu dlc hard call improv got good enough even step back commun vocal sieg alreadi weak part game made complex attempt make fun larger immort empir map size new faction great warhamm whole new game whole new game feel like warhamm major content updatesdlc qualityoflif mod

"Once Human promised an immersive open-world experience in a post-apocalyptic setting, but unfortunately, it fails to deliver on many fronts. The game’s visuals are lackluster and lack the polish one would expect from a title in 2024. The environments feel generic, making exploration feel more like a chore than an adventure.Gameplay mechanics are clunky and unrefined. Combat often feels unresponsive, with hit detection issues that can lead to frustrating encounters. The crafting system, which could have added depth, feels overly complicated and is plagued by repetitive resource gathering that quickly becomes tedious.One of the most frustrating aspects is the six-week reset mechanic. This arbitrary timer not only disrupts progression but also feels like a forced attempt to keep players engaged. Instead of fostering a sense of achievement, it creates anxiety and resentment as players feel pressured to grind through content before the reset hits. This design choice detracts significantly from the overall experience, making it hard to invest time and effort into the game.The story is another major letdown. What could have been an intriguing narrative is bogged down by uninspired writing and poorly developed characters. The dialogue feels forced, making it hard to connect with the plot or care about the outcomes of any of the characters.Multiplayer elements seem tacked on rather than integrated smoothly into the game, leading to disjointed experiences that lack cohesion. The matchmaking can be frustratingly slow, and once in-game, coordination with teammates can be a hassle due to poor communication tools.Overall, Once Human is a missed opportunity that falls short of expectations. It’s a game that feels more like a slog than an engaging experience, leaving players longing for a more polished and innovative approach to the genre.",human promis immers openworld experi postapocalypt set unfortun fail deliv mani front game visual lacklust lack polish one would expect titl environ feel gener make explor feel like chore adventuregameplay mechan clunki unrefin combat often feel unrespons hit detect issu lead frustrat encount craft system could ad depth feel overli complic plagu repetit resourc gather quickli becom tediouson frustrat aspect sixweek reset mechan arbitrari timer disrupt progress also feel like forc attempt keep player engag instead foster sens achiev creat anxieti resent player feel pressur grind content reset hit design choic detract significantli overal experi make hard invest time effort gameth stori anoth major letdown could intrigu narr bog uninspir write poorli develop charact dialogu feel forc make hard connect plot care outcom charactersmultiplay element seem tack rather integr smoothli game lead disjoint experi lack cohes matchmak frustratingli slow ingam coordin teammat hassl due poor commun toolsoveral human miss opportun fall short expect game feel like slog engag experi leav player long polish innov approach genr

"2022 Quite frankly the best open world I have ever played and will play for a long while. It really is the only game that has perfected open world and that sense of ""open"". It doesn't force you or tell you to do anything, it throws you into the world with little direction and the wonderment and curiosity of the player take the reigns from there. Very similar to BotW but with an outstanding world, packed to the brim with fun, unique encounters around quite literally every corner. There is always something new just at the end of your line of sight that has this amazing power to draw the player in. The amount of content, and varied at that, that From Soft was able to fit in here will be talked about for years to come.The game wasn't without it's downsides though, albeit few and minor. The performance on PC was terrible and remained for the 2.5 weeks it took me to play. No excuses at this point for framerates locked to 60. The game also for better or worse does not tell you much and while that is a welcome change and makes the discovery feel better, there needed to be some kind of codex for the player to remember the plethora of plotlines. The world is so huge that the next time you return to a plotline you end up forgetting 70% of it. And lastly the balance of the game, something From Soft were absolute masters at with their previous entries, is beyond broken to the point where it is a bit frustrating. I fought Margit completely underpowered because I favored the main story at that point but from then on I explored 95% of the world before tackling the main story portion in the area and found bosses dropping like flies. They need to work in some kind of scaling system if they continue with the open world. For this reason this was hands down, and not even close, the easiest Souls game to date (post Margit).A fantastic entry in the series that also deserves a nod for the world that was created by GRRM. Very unique and very cool with a whole slew of interesting and well designed characters. Will definitely be a game you see high up on many ""top games of all-time"" lists, and an easy recommendation for anyone, especially due to the low level of difficulty.",quit frankli best open world ever play play long realli game perfect open world sens open doesnt forc tell anyth throw world littl direct wonder curios player take reign similar botw outstand world pack brim fun uniqu encount around quit liter everi corner alway someth new end line sight amaz power draw player amount content vari soft abl fit talk year cometh game wasnt without downsid though albeit minor perform pc terribl remain week took play excus point framer lock game also better wors tell much welcom chang make discoveri feel better need kind codex player rememb plethora plotlin world huge next time return plotlin end forget lastli balanc game someth soft absolut master previou entri beyond broken point bit frustrat fought margit complet underpow favor main stori point explor world tackl main stori portion area found boss drop like fli need work kind scale system continu open world reason hand even close easiest soul game date post margita fantast entri seri also deserv nod world creat grrm uniqu cool whole slew interest well design charact definit game see high mani top game alltim list easi recommend anyon especi due low level difficulti

"Another game that's fun for a while, but that I believe will die out within release year.This is quite an amalgamation of themes and genres. The setting feels similar to games like Control / SCP, while gameplay seems to borrow more from games like Rust & PUBG.Gameplay loop is simple: Loot tier 1 areas, create tier 1 buildings & gear, fight boss, unlock tier 2. Loot tier 2 areas, create tier 2 buildings & gear, fight boss, unlock tier 3.Loot tier 3 areas, create tier 3 buildings & gear, fight boss, unlock tier 4.This is fine, 6.5/10 fun, but:The gameplay loop has 2 big issues for me currently: 1. Enemy AI is not great & being reckless is seldom punished. You can melee every single non-boss enemy with 0 issue. They get stunlocked, no matter the size, no matter the level. They can't fight back. This makes looting cities just feel like a checklist. It's not particularly exciting.2. Building structures doesn't feel great right now.

Immortal empires is warhammer III...Sadly Immortal empires doesn't come with any pre-game customizations. You get the map as it is, with a billion choices, but always the same.

"2022 edit: this was originally a negative review due to performance issues and glitches, these have since been patchedElden ring is a fantastic culmination of fromsofts design lessons from dark souls. While i have some personal hiccups here and there, its undeniably a fantastic game.For the first attempt at making dark souls an open world game, its crazy how well it was executed. The term ""open world"" might make you wince a bit seeing how for most games ""open world"" means ""we made a big empty map of nothing and filled it with objective markers to pretend there is content. There might also be concerns on how the dark souls formula of tightly designed challenges and areas would function if the world is now meant to be freely explored on your own pace. But i can honestly say they found a good way of mixing both together. The world may be open now but youll come across castles or caverns that are tightly designed like the areas of old titles with shortcuts, bonfires and bosses at the end all without loading screen or obvious level transitions. The game will simply force you off your horse and uses clever level design to prevent major skips from happening so you get that tight level design youre so familiar with. The combat is better than ever and uses many lessons learned from previous titles while also mixing in brand new ones to give a fresh but still familiar dark souls feel. The story has the usual vague feel to it, but puts in a bit more effort to try and convey whats happening than previous games (although its very likely youll still need to look up videos by the end of your journey to really understand what you just went through).I could go on and on on what the game does to well but the review would turn out to be very wordy, its easier to say what i didnt enjoy to allow you to come to your own conclusion on if the negatives are enough to push you away from trying this title. But keep in mind that any negatives mentioned dont outweigh the sheer amount of positives this game has to offer.1. The main story path is actively scaled to curve insanely hard at the first boss, so when you get to them you'll find yourself struggling super hard and start questioning if you're doing things right. The game is designed that way to encourage you to leave the boss alone and explore instead (to get new weapons/armor/abilities etc) but its not at all clear when playing that that is what you're meant to do. 2. While the game boasts an impressive 238 bosses, its worth noting that a massive amount of them end up being just regular enemies with beefed up hp and damage. Not to mention having a ton of repeats of the same boss with slightly different attacks.3. The nature of the open world means that its entirely possible (and arguably unavoidable) that youll end up completely overpowered for some areas/bosses which robs you of a fun fight in a lot of cases. (Luckily the main bosses needed for the main campaign dont really have this issue and are scaled quite well with your progress)4. The multiplayer is once again a pain in the butt to use. If youre playing with friends, prepare to grind tons of flower pedals as youre required to use one every single time you die and want to re-connect with friends which also opens your world up for invasions which are arguably more annoying in this game than any other. Because areas are so incredibly large, its not uncommon to get invaded but spend 30 minutes trying to find out where they are hiding because the pvp invasions are not limited to the small castle/designated areas, its entirely possible to be invaded while out in the open world. It literally turns into an hour long hide and seek session and is more annoying than any fun that could be had from the combat, so its better to disconnect and re-connect with friends than it is to deal with the whole thing. People have taken to modding in a better multiplayer that fixes most of these issues.Thats it! If none of those bother you much then you should have bought this game already.",edit origin neg review due perform issu glitch sinc patchedelden ring fantast culmin fromsoft design lesson dark soul person hiccup undeni fantast gamefor first attempt make dark soul open world game crazi well execut term open world might make winc bit see game open world mean made big empti map noth fill object marker pretend content might also concern dark soul formula tightli design challeng area would function world meant freeli explor pace honestli say found good way mix togeth world may open youll come across castl cavern tightli design like area old titl shortcut bonfir boss end without load screen obviou level transit game simpli forc hors use clever level design prevent major skip happen get tight level design your familiar combat better ever use mani lesson learn previou titl also mix brand new one give fresh still familiar dark soul feel stori usual vagu feel put bit effort tri convey what happen previou game although like youll still need look video end journey realli understand went throughi could go game well review would turn wordi easier say didnt enjoy allow come conclus neg enough push away tri titl keep mind neg mention dont outweigh sheer amount posit game main stori path activ scale curv insan hard first boss get youll find struggl super hard start question your thing right game design way encourag leav boss alon explor instead get new weaponsarmor etc clear play your meant game boast impress boss worth note massiv amount end regular enemi beef hp damag mention ton repeat boss slightli differ natur open world mean entir possibl arguabl unavoid youll end complet overpow areasboss rob fun fight lot case luckili main boss need main campaign dont realli issu scale quit well multiplay pain butt use your play friend prepar grind ton flower pedal your requir use one everi singl time die want reconnect friend also open world invas arguabl annoy game area incred larg uncommon get invad spend minut tri find hide pvp invas limit small castledesign area entir possibl invad open world liter turn hour long hide seek session annoy fun could combat better disconnect reconnect friend deal whole thing peopl taken mod better multiplay fix issuesthat none bother much bought game alreadi
"2014 I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator.

"It's been a long 13 years waiting to find out whatever happened to Titus after the end of Space Marine, but the day is finally here. Some people think the single player campaign is a little short, but for me it fell right into the Goldilocks zone (just right) and the story was worth the wait.Gameplay-wise, the pacing is very good. The Tyranid swarms can be insanely frenzied and near panic-inducing, while dealing with the Thousand Sons and their Tzaangor and Cultist allies tends to be more methodical but just as deadly.Dealing with the lowest-tier riff-raff goes along like you'd expect it to... they're a breeze individually but dangerous in numbers; still, most weapons will take them out with a single shot/strike. But as the opposition scales up, even the best weapons start to feel like you're just tickling the biggest/baddest opponents. Naturally they should be significantly tougher, but when your biggest and best guns or melee weapons are only knocking off a sliver of their health at a time with headshots or your heaviest blows, it's a little disheartening. In the campaign this is just something you'll have to deal with, but in Multiplayer you level up your gear and unlock various class perks as you win victories and this becomes less of a burden. There are two modes, Operations and Eternal War, PVE and PVP respectively. Eternal War is definitely fun and challenging, but if I'm being honest, I enjoy playing with two others in the Co-Op Operations, where you have a little more feeling of purpose as you go along and achieve your mission requirements.Graphically, it's just a beautiful game. My GeForce 4080 is running it maxed out with no problems but I was worried for my grandson who's PC is just slightly above minimum specs. Happily, he's also running it surprisingly well with a few lower settings than I have but it still looks absolutely tremendous.Honestly the only gripes I've had are the aforementioned problems with weapons not feeling up to the task on the bossier enemies, and Clive Standen taking over from Mark Strong as the voice of Titus. Strong's voice was just so iconic for me, but after not too long, Standen made it his own and all was well again in short order.",long year wait find whatev happen titu end space marin day final peopl think singl player campaign littl short fell right goldilock zone right stori worth waitgameplaywis pace good tyranid swarm insan frenzi near panicinduc deal thousand son tzaangor cultist alli tend method deadlyd lowestti riffraff goe along like youd expect theyr breez individu danger number still weapon take singl shotstrik opposit scale even best weapon start feel like your tickl biggestbaddest oppon natur significantli tougher biggest best gun mele weapon knock sliver health time headshot heaviest blow littl dishearten campaign someth youll deal multiplay level gear unlock variou class perk win victori becom less burden two mode oper etern war pve pvp respect etern war definit fun challeng im honest enjoy play two other coop oper littl feel purpos go along achiev mission requirementsgraph beauti game geforc run max problem worri grandson who pc slightli minimum spec happili he also run surprisingli well lower set still look absolut tremendoushonestli gripe ive aforement problem weapon feel task bossier enemi clive standen take mark strong voic titu strong voic icon long standen made well short order

I've rolled through entire factions in just a matter of a few turns.

"What I like about this game: The story is very good. It can work quite well as a possible sequel to the original Journey to the West Overall graphics, design of characters and all aesthetics related material are actually quite good, I like it, even the low graphics setting is pretty solid The gear, and the ability to get the mats are not too bad. If you take the time to explore. You will be able to mostly craft a decent amount of armor sets near end game. I think I was able to create at the very least 2 - 3 sets before NG. Combat is not too shabby either, with a but....will be in the ""What I don't like/prefer to see change""What I don't like/prefer to see change: One of the biggest things that I recognized almost immediately is the lack of a map, having a map would've been so helpful in exploring these huge maps and areas. Especially since each chapter is quite long. I personally would've preferred that leveling increased your attack and defense, maybe not every level but maybe every other level or two at the least. Some bosses just do so much damage. And if your someone like me that has a bit of a slow brain and takes time to adjust to these attack timings, it would've really helped alot. Now for the combat, I think that for the most part like mentioned above its not bad. You have light attacks, dodging, heavy attacks and the usual. But what I experienced at least is, sometimes the game will not respond to some of my commands and I will have pressed that hotkey...exaggerating....like a bazillion times. Like space bar for dodge. And there were some bosses were my lock on would randomly disappear on its own. Not for when bosses fly high in the sky or something. Like it would be when its just regular combat near/on the ground. Whether this is a bug or my PC I don't know. But this is what I am experiencing. No mana regen mechanic other then a poor restore rate using gourd.

"Space Marine 2 is a good example of what we've lost due to games as a service and predatory monetization schemes, with videogames whose sole purpose of development is to serve as a cosmetics and skins virtual store.Saber has transported me back to the first decade of the 2000s when video games were just art and pure entertainment.

"This isnt a story about journey to the west.Its a myth about a monkey ascending to become wukong and wukong fans should play it.Pros: 1. Smooth combat (responsive soulslike, you get rewarded for being aggressive, you punish enemy openings at the right timings)2. Large Variety of Enemies (all enemies are different. only 3-4 repeats which are rarely overlapped)3. Good graphics/immersive environment/art4.

Invisible walls (mildly annoying to constantly test jumping to check for hidden areas -> use google to make your life easier)3.

The main gamemode they have going is really neat at first and I like that they added a story kinda but there is no mortal empires or anything. Having to basically stay in your own little area because the chaos rifts open and just attack your settlements so your constantly playing defensive just isnt really that fun. Plus if your like me and like to take ages to build up your bases and build up only 2 or 3 really op armies, by the time you get them some other faction wins the game and its just over. You cant continue after or anything. Thats it you lose and it boots you out lol. But yeah hopefully mortal empires is added soon so it will be more enjoyable.",want give good review know fact im gon na switch later id hold game bit main gamemod go realli neat first like ad stori kinda mortal empir anyth basic stay littl area chao rift open attack settlement constantli play defens isnt realli fun plu like like take age build base build realli op armi time get faction win game cant continu anyth that lose boot lol yeah hope mortal empir ad soon enjoy

Personally, I will play it casually and maybe delve into a campaign for a few hours to kill time in some morbid reminiscence of WH2 and what WH3 could've been, for contrast I have 1990 hours in WH2 and 80 in WH3 after 6 months release. The negatives are quite obvious. - Bad performance and stuttering with no fix in sight really. ( there won't be any fix until the shills start accepting that 30 fps isn't good enough performance.) - Worse settlement battles than it's predecessor which is still in my opinion a superior Total War game. - Worse sieges than it's predecessor instead of improving it's more of a capture point game which turns the inevitable slog that is the sieges in Total War : Warhammer series into an even more annoying endeavour. - Worse performance at high resolution for no apparent reason, i get 30 FPS on the campaign map while WH2 is smooth and around 60 - 75 FPS.- CA keep making abritrary dumb changes to campaigns that aren't really what we needed just in some mad scramble to rectify the absolute sorry state of the game in which it was released.- Less land battles...... ( why ...?) - There's still adundant visual glitches on the maps and lighting, obviously IE released and not all the maps will look perfect but they should've at least gave them a try first ( Blackfire Pass being toned over with a weird blue filter for example.) + Better DLC ( 4 lords in one pack is a good idea and i advocated for this a long time ago) + Better unit texture.... I guess. ( Kislev look terrible.) + Better vassals and diplomacy. All in all i'd say stick to WH2 if you really want to just enjoy a good Warhammer total war experience this game just isn't it, it feels flat and soulless to me and consistently has been like that since release.....and even now with the IE '' beta''. Final note: CA fix the performance cause it does kill the experience, settlement battles aren't improved in fact they're flat out garbage and everyone knows they are, it's not even a Total War: Warhammer game with they way they work as it stands and buffs for units capturing points, with multiple capture points pasted over every settlement battle and siege is stupidity and i shouldn't really need a bunch of modders changes to rectify it.",tri still stand review absolut perform garbag there salvag travesti absolut f game l compani ca fix perform piec game man still fix campaign map stutter ive amend initi review say ok best ok masterpiec peopl say clearli blind fanboy devot person play casual mayb delv campaign hour kill time morbid reminisc couldv contrast hour month releas neg quit obviou bad perform stutter fix sight realli wont fix shill start accept fp isnt good enough perform wors settlement battl predecessor still opinion superior total war game wors sieg predecessor instead improv captur point game turn inevit slog sieg total war warhamm seri even annoy endeavour wors perform high resolut appar reason get fp campaign map smooth around fp ca keep make abritrari dumb chang campaign arent realli need mad scrambl rectifi absolut sorri state game releas less land battl there still adund visual glitch map light obvious ie releas map look perfect shouldv least gave tri first blackfir pass tone weird blue filter exampl better dlc lord one pack good idea advoc long time ago better unit textur guess kislev look terribl better vassal diplomaci id say stick realli want enjoy good warhamm total war experi game isnt feel flat soulless consist like sinc releaseand even ie beta final note ca fix perform caus kill experi settlement battl arent improv fact theyr flat garbag everyon know even total war warhamm game way work stand buff unit captur point multipl captur point past everi settlement battl sieg stupid shouldnt realli need bunch modder chang rectifi

"2022 Worse than TWW2 (current build) but better release than TWW2 release. I'm sure this will be awesome with a mortal empires/grand campaign added, in the future.Positives:-Many improvements to mechanics, diplomacy especially, saves soooo much time.-Allies are useful now, recruit allied units, coordinate and have fun -You can trade settlements!-Badass demon campaign mechanics, you are actually pretty powerful, and you feel it.-Great soundtracks, animations, landscapes and battle locations (except walled cities)Issues: -Some maps, like Altdorf are still missing textures.-Very poor end game reward, without spoilers.....very underwhelming for what it can do and what it comes with. Same reward for everyone, the narrative reward isn't granted, its just cutscenes and you don't get any new traits, abilities or anything.-Once you beat the campaign, have fun with never ending chaos invasions every 10 turns, forever. this requires you to have a hero stationed at each and every entry point, ready to close the portal for 1.5k gold, every 10 turns. if you want to take over the map, get ready to shell out tens of thousands of gold every 10 turns and bump up your hero cap.-The realms of chaos give little to no rewards. you really only go to slaanesh's penthouse to get fancy trinkets, the rest are trash, leaving you with bad traits.-No mortal empires yet-Walled cities hurt you, dont get them. Currently, when you try to dock archers on walls or whatever, their line of sight is often blocked and they just sit there, so you have to set archers behind walls or somewhere they can shoot from.-Adding walls to a settlement will place two capture points for your town/city, so instead of setting all your forces on top of an objective and defending, you have to split your force. Is it worth it to have 3 more units garrisoning your town but have to defend two capture points, which losing one loses the battle? NO, fight in the strees, no walls.",wors current build better releas releas im sure awesom mortal empiresgrand campaign ad futurepositivesmani improv mechan diplomaci especi save soooo much timeal use recruit alli unit coordin fun trade settlementsbadass demon campaign mechan actual pretti power feel itgreat soundtrack anim landscap battl locat except wall citiesissu map like altdorf still miss texturesveri poor end game reward without spoilersveri underwhelm come reward everyon narr reward isnt grant cutscen dont get new trait abil anythingonc beat campaign fun never end chao invas everi turn forev requir hero station everi entri point readi close portal gold everi turn want take map get readi shell ten thousand gold everi turn bump hero capth realm chao give littl reward realli go slaanesh penthous get fanci trinket rest trash leav bad traitsno mortal empir yetwal citi hurt dont get current tri dock archer wall whatev line sight often block sit set archer behind wall somewher shoot fromad wall settlement place two captur point townciti instead set forc top object defend split forc worth unit garrison town defend two captur point lose one lose battl fight stree wall

"2022 From what can be seen, Creative Assembly did not understand their mistake. Players will be compensated for SOC content to the new standard and that's it. Despite the clear response from the community that the campaign for the new Lord of Tzeentch is boring and bad, they do not plan to do anything with it. This is the least of the problems here, this game has serious problems and bugs such as ogres, which are mechanically broken in every aspect, playing them is even banned in most tournaments! Many Legendary Lord factions suffer from a very long list of bugs that have not been addressed in any way since launch. We finally got Chaos reworked, but Norsca is still buggy and very very boring. It's been almost 2 years and this game is still bugged to the point where every single person encounters at least some bugs in every campaign! They don't even care to do something with Realms of Chaos which (yet again) many players compained that it's boring since you can easily repell chaos invasion without much effort.

"I absolutely loved this game. Played it in CBT3, did fan art, was a regular on the Discord, planned to build one of the monsters for Halloween but I am quitting now, absolutely not recommending it, and these are my reasons. I have mostly played it on their launcher so my hours here do not reflect time played. I got to 48 in beta and 39 on my main character since release and hundreds hours of play between the two. The good is as follows... The monster and world design is great, combat is fun, the map is fantastic for exploring (which I have spent whole nights doing) and even just getting on your bike to get where you are going for the sheer joy of driving through it. The game loop is quite addictive till you start hitting the friction points and thinking about the looming demise of all your hard work. This company wields FOMO like finely honed sword. That coupled with the short seasons which have 'exclusive items' just generates a feeling of being rushed even though I know there are several more weeks, I just don't feel like I can get everything done in time and I would end up having to start over in many ways (I am very familiar with what you keep between seasons). This might not be such a huge problem with many gamers but I want to clear all the areas, collect all formulas for the items to put in your base, and feel like I have actually accomplished something.On top of the time limit actually getting these formulas is very grindy and I just don't see how anyone could get them all without being very lucky and in game every waking moment. The other issue is the building system is buggy and limited. The aesthetics are hit or miss, mostly miss and you can't really customize cosmetic or house items, (there are a few you can choose between ugly and ugli). All the build pieces are very modern and that's not an aesthetic I enjoy so my attempt at a Queen Anne house ends up looking like a McMansion. It's hard to justify spending a lot in the cash shop when I have a roof corner that will not place for love nor money even though it was there previously before dissapearing randomly so I have a piano on my roof. Absurd problems require absurd solutions. Another glaring issue is character progression. A lot of the abilities for crafting, upgrading, and maintaining your base and equipment are behind RNG with appalingly limited opportunities to reset anything.. This is incredibly frustrating if you have bad luck in getting the critical abilities like being able to make acid from sulfur and if you do get the good ones they will be reset for the next season. Maybe this is encouraging people to work in groups but not everyone can do that so this mechanic makes the game very unfriendly for those that solo. The economy is also frustrating. There is no central, global way to trade. The vending machines you can sell from are local to your territory or truck later in game and you have to place it somewhere and hope people interact with it. We are relegated to the old days of spamming chat to try and sell what you have, hoping someone will come to your vending machine and we are forced to do this because there is a ridiculously low buying cap on the few vendors in the game so it is impossible to actually level the abilities that aren't RNG which cost money as well as points. You also need money to teleport, buy the expensive formluas the vendors have, and some other things cost here and there too. There are too many currencies, too many menus buried within more menus and it's easy to forget where to do something or lose track of all the buttons you have to click on to get the measly rewards you can get from completing season goals, or daily whatever. It's a chore to navigate this nested mess.The game has a lot of glaring instances where it is obviously unfinished. Missing translations, odd animations and mismatched dialog. I question how they are going to provide new content every 6 weeks in perpetuity, as seems to be what's promised, when the starting scenerio is unfinished.I hate having to break up with Once Human. I have a pretty big emotional and time investment if only a limited financial one. This really could have been THE GAME but there are too many problems, too many choices that cause player frustration, and I just can't spend most of my free time anymore knowing I will just have to do it again in a month or so.

"2022 Edit: The most recent update is certainly a step in the right direction. Anti-player bias was reduced and a lot of big issues such as replenishment was improved for some factions. Whoever is now managing the project seem to be more receptive/involved with the community. I'll keep this as negative still for now but its FINALLY improving the way people asked.Edit#2: Game has fixed most of its launch issues now. A few lay around waiting to ambush you at annoying moments but overall, it's a far better game now. I'm leaving the review up as I personally am very exhausted of total war games coming out with horrific balance and would like this to serve as a reminder. If this game came out in the state it is now in, it would be a big thumbs up.Ooof where to start? The fact that it wasn't ready? The fact that they doubled down on things people hated in the other games? The freakishly slow updates to get some of the most basic issues fixed? The fact a warhammer game needs almost an entire year to get blood added?... a warhammer game, where you can play as the blood god. The fact the main campaign is an absolute miserable experience? There's just.. so much more. I'll start with the positives.The main positive I could give is that factions have much more engaging mechanics to them than earlier games. Even if their rosters are miserably small... no we're trying to say something nice here. Ogres feel actually finished as a roster, with interesting mechanics and a wide variety of units.The bad.. well it's difficult to explain how extremely bad some of these things are with a character limit so short. I could write multiple pages about the design flaws in the main campaign. Flaws ranging from complex issues that are difficult to deal with to amateur design choices that you'd imagine get thrown out the first time they slip from anyone's lips let alone added to a 60$ AAA title.The campaign is effectively a race, which gets triggered every 20-30 turns. Unfortunately, this absolutely kills the pacing of the base Total War gameplay. Everything comes to a halt, as you enter Chaos realms to get a soul first. Only to realiize that you are the only one playing this game. The AI is not playing the same game as you at all. They do not have the same challenges, they do not get the same debuffs, they do not have to complete the same puzzles, they do not need buildings to recruit units, they do not need to actually do anything you do. They just automatically breeze through while you suffer the most miserable experiences of endless debuffs and being attacked by other enemies while your main army is in some pocket dimension. The game actively punishes you for playing the game as intended. Expanding your settlements and empire means the AI will disproportionately focus you. Allowing their own home to be burned down with no reaction, while sending 3 armies to your doorstep. Maybe get allies? They could be useful if there wasn't an in game design that makes any AI who you alliance with, suddenly become the most passive and weak faction. Yes, if you alliance with an AI, they actually get their AI debuffed to not do anything by themselves. The AI is just so obviously AI due to its comical level of player targeting bias. Shamelessly doing anything it can to stop you while doing nothing else the entire game. An issue so bad, even the developers have had to admit it needs fixing. Just keep in mind, this was not added as a bug, this was the INTENDED DESIGN.The game is such a mess, everything has been put on hold. Months dedicated to fix the horrific design choices that were baked deep into the game. Also, 7 months needed to fix replenishment for 2 factions? What is going on over there? How does it take 7 months to fix things that modders fixed within hours of mods coming out?Give it a year or a little more, then it might be in a launchable state. Sadly it could have been good, but CA decided to ignore feedback and stick with whatever they wanted to do.

"I dont normally review but CA has been impressing me with their change of attitude. Shadows new update has revived my opinion of the game and its development team, I have bought every DLC since WH1 and have over 1000 hours on each game and had some less than impressive DLC's but SoC on release was the worst by far. While WH3 runs poorly sometimes, especially in a modded/Multiplayer campaign, it is still an incredible game that brings the series together.

"2014 When Counter Strike: GO came out it wasn't very good, and the online servers was quite dead.But after a year of updates the game have become really good! I knew Valve and the team behind cs wouldn't let the cs fans down. Counter strike GO offers different gamemodes, improved graphics and overall options, a ranking system for those interested and a good variety of maps and weapons! The competitive scene have grown, and I think thats great. Unlike some other FPS, cs requires skill and training. When the game came out you couldn't customize the weapons very much, but now thats possible, with thousands of badass looking skins and stuff. CS:GO is really cheap compared to most competitors, so Im recommending it without doubt.",counter strike go came wasnt good onlin server quit deadbut year updat game becom realli good knew valv team behind cs wouldnt let cs fan counter strike go offer differ gamemod improv graphic overal option rank system interest good varieti map weapon competit scene grown think that great unlik fp cs requir skill train game came couldnt custom weapon much that possibl thousand badass look skin stuff csgo realli cheap compar competitor im recommend without doubt

"2022 Its hard to put into words the joy Elden Ring has brought me. Rarely do I see a game where you can explore and fight your way through a huge fantasy world, with so many functional builds to play as, and just so much to explore and so much to see, stuff to find that actually matters for the improvement of your character, and unique underground and hidden areas to find.It expertly blends the grand sense of adventure and discovery in the open world, with the tighter more focused exploration of its large 'dungeon' type areas.. while while blended seamlessly with the surrounding world, also feel like a self-contained experience that is more traditionally Dark Souls like in a lot of ways. You'll see what I mean when you get into Stormveil Castle for the first time and see how the feel of the gameplay shifts to something veterans of the Souls series will feel more at home with.I also think it does a good job of making the game a little more accessible to players who found From's similar games to be too difficult, while still offering a challenge. I particularly like how the world allows you alternatives to just trying to push forward when you're having difficulty.. It's a simple matter to just abandon the area or boss that is giving you trouble, and trying your luck elsewhere for a while.. and maybe out there you'll go up in stats, find some more charges for your Flask, improve your weapons or find better gear, obtain some new magic or learn how to craft a helpful item, and also hone your own abilities as a player with practice without frustration.. then when you come back, that impossible boss won't seem so hard anymore.I love this game. It's just one of those things that checks all the boxes for me, and I'd encourage anyone curious to try it... especially since they're now already patching the game to try to relieve some of the troubles that PC players were having on launch (I count myself lucky to not have those problems myself..

"2022 First: I am not very good at souls games and it is sometimes hard for me to stay focussed and don't get too frustrated. I play on an rtx3080 and the performance sucks the most in the open world. There is no difference for me to play on low or ultra, the frame drops will appeare anyway.But in legacy dungeon or other not so open areals the Performance is just fine. A fix, plus widescreen support would be highly appreciated.To the game: It is a masterpiece.I roamed the open world and found places, friendly characters and scary enemies. The longer I played, the better it got to just explore and taking risks.The ""bon fires"" placement and additional options have made a huge step in the quality of live direction.You can take runs on bosses/npcs/situations without to beat half of the game and slay 3 demi gods on the way. But I already experienced the dark souls feeling in some places but you are far away from being forced to be stuck.

"2022 Let's be real for a second: This game without any DLC or predecessors is not even half a Total War game and the price you are asked to pay for the ""full experience"" is only stomachable, if you bought the other stuff you want in it over the last years.The balancing is all over the place, since CA ramped up the magic from I to II to III considerably and throws in elite units like it's going out of style, Once you've met a half dead Chaos army that still kicks ass because every single unit is a super elite unit, you'll know what I mean. The difficulty setting essentially just beefs up the AI units to ridiculous levels and reduces their upkeep so a faction a tenth your size may field as many armies as you have, Legendary Lords may have the most special of special effects - or a minor economy buff, so if you meet one in battle, be prepared for nasty surprises. Even just on ""hard"" difficulty, I've seen the AI attacking me, getting killed to the last zombie (Sylvania) and both attacking armies were back to full strength with the lords I just put in the ground... there may be some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around.Endgame scenarios follow the old CA-route: Just throw a ton of elite fullstacks at the player, because that's fun. Idk if it were an actual horde attack, but the spawning of - for example 15 stacks of elite wood elves who just go on the rampage until you burn their stupid forest - is plainly creativly bankrupt.The design of minor villages is moronic in the extreme and mostly doesn't benefit the defender nearly as much as it should in the case of dwarfs, humans and elfs, who may have things like ""firing lanes"" and ""defensive positions"" in mind. There are -for example- often courts which might concentrate the enemy by blocking off the exits, but you can't put any ranged units in good firing positions around it. Sieges are still as stupid as they were in TWWHI. everybody has a ladder up his arse and walls are little more than death traps for your troops. Knocking down reenforced gates with clubs and fists takes about as much time as it takes a unit to leave the wall.I'm not saying I'm not having some fun in this game, but it could be much better, especially since it's the third and final entry in the series. So if you liked the other two TWWHs and have all the DLC races you might want to play, go ahead and buy it, but if you are new to the whole TWWH... go get something else, this game will annoy the hell outta you.",let real second game without dlc predecessor even half total war game price ask pay full experi stomach bought stuff want last yearsth balanc place sinc ca ramp magic ii iii consider throw elit unit like go style youv met half dead chao armi still kick ass everi singl unit super elit unit youll know mean difficulti set essenti beef ai unit ridicul level reduc upkeep faction tenth size may field mani armi legendari lord may special special effect minor economi buff meet one battl prepar nasti surpris even hard difficulti ive seen ai attack get kill last zombi sylvania attack armi back full strength lord put ground may aroundendgam scenario follow old carout throw ton elit fullstack player that fun idk actual hord attack spawn exampl stack elit wood elv go rampag burn stupid forest plainli creativli bankruptth design minor villag moron extrem mostli doesnt benefit defend nearli much case dwarf human elf may thing like fire lane defens posit mind exampl often court might concentr enemi block exit cant put rang unit good fire posit around sieg still stupid twwhi everybodi ladder ars wall littl death trap troop knock reenforc gate club fist take much time take unit leav wallim say im fun game could much better especi sinc third final entri seri like two twwh dlc race might want play go ahead buy new whole twwh go get someth els game annoy hell outta

"2022 Other than the poor game optimization.Not Fun gameplay mechanics:New Siege gameplay does not feel Total War.Defense towers are just getting auto build every 30-60 seconds , can rebuild a tower in 30-60 seconds.building walls also takes 20 seconds.no building require a unit to build it. everything is auto.now as attacker all you get to do is full rush , capture supplies sectors, other than a real siege battle. Magic Spells are too strong a 16 point magic attack decimate 80-90 solders in a single hit, the wizard is not a legendary lord, and not even a lord just a hero. can get up to 700 kills with a level 8 wizard to how the abilities are. Center of Mass for units older total war, if you are aiming muskets on a target to your right, the unit would rotate depending on the soldier in the middle of the squad, but now would rotate depending on the solider in the front of the squad, making it an absolute chaos/Khorne to control them.

"Problems With the Progression System The current progression system in an otherwise great game is a turn-off and is going to drive would be players away from sticking with the game as it evolves over the course of its road map Separate Cosmetic and Class Progression Having a single currency, Requisitions, be required to progress these categories puts players in a position where they are going to make mistakes as they try to kit out their preferred Astartes Chapter. Players will be in search of the correct right shoulder insignia or company pauldron trim paint and this means sacrificing progression of class skills. There is no explanation of this risk to a new player and the system itself is so frustrating its easy to have level 15 in a class and not be able to afford even the first row of its perks. Class skills should just unlock at the appropriate level. There should be no need to also buy them with Requisitions. The amount of Requisitions for victory should be increased at each difficulty level. You should still receive a reduced amount of Requisitions for mission failure. Continue to require victory to progress in unlocking distinct armor parts. Weapon Progression is Simply A Bad Approach The weapon system is convoluted and tying better weapons behind higher difficulty is a guaranteed way to drive players away out of frustration. The Minimal difficulty in this game is hard and recommending ""Level 5"" to players to take on the next difficulty tier is meaningless if they have spent their Requisitions on cosmetics instead of their class skills. Mastery tokens should simply be removed from the game. As you progress experience on a weapon class the perks should also just unlock without having to acquire a mastery token. Locking the Armory Data required to advance a weapon class to its higher tier is a bad formula. Some players will never be able to achieve those weapon data tiers and as such will remain stuck at a lower difficulty without a means to improve their offensive abilities beyond a point. Armory Data needs an exchange system such as 5 Green can exchange for 1 Purple as so on. This system also needs FAR better in game tools and tutorials without everyone having to refer to out of date early access review information or Reddit posts trying to figure out how this all works Potential But Also Potential To Die Fast This game is going to draw a lot of attention when it fully launches. People will be excited about playing as a Space Marine. Even with the above suggested changes the game is going to be a GRIND to progress. When players find out their progress is also heavily skill gated in what is a seriously difficult game they will move on to the next thing. Its important to preserve the high difficulty for players who have the skill and want that challenge. its equally important that the perks and equipment necessary to play on higher difficulties become available to players of lower skill and that the systems involved here be retooled quickly or this game will end up with a very small player base of nothing but hardcore difficulty seekers. The entire backbone of what is otherwise a great game, its progression systems, are a total miss and I hope you take the above as constructive criticism to improve the game and sustain your audience while you still have the opportunity to do so.I cannot recommend this game until the progression system and economy for multiplayer are addressed, not at the full price asking point.",problem progress system current progress system otherwis great game turnoff go drive would player away stick game evolv cours road map separ cosmet class progress singl currenc requisit requir progress categori put player posit go make mistak tri kit prefer astart chapter player search correct right shoulder insignia compani pauldron trim paint mean sacrif progress class skill explan risk new player system frustrat easi level class abl afford even first row perk class skill unlock appropri level need also buy requisit amount requisit victori increas difficulti level still receiv reduc amount requisit mission failur continu requir victori progress unlock distinct armor part weapon progress simpli bad approach weapon system convolut tie better weapon behind higher difficulti guarante way drive player away frustrat minim difficulti game hard recommend level player take next difficulti tier meaningless spent requisit cosmet instead class skill masteri token simpli remov game progress experi weapon class perk also unlock without acquir masteri token lock armori data requir advanc weapon class higher tier bad formula player never abl achiev weapon data tier remain stuck lower difficulti without mean improv offens abil beyond point armori data need exchang system green exchang purpl system also need far better game tool tutori without everyon refer date earli access review inform reddit post tri figur work potenti also potenti die fast game go draw lot attent fulli launch peopl excit play space marin even suggest chang game go grind progress player find progress also heavili skill gate serious difficult game move next thing import preserv high difficulti player skill want challeng equal import perk equip necessari play higher difficulti becom avail player lower skill system involv retool quickli game end small player base noth hardcor difficulti seeker entir backbon otherwis great game progress system total miss hope take construct critic improv game sustain audienc still opportun soi recommend game progress system economi multiplay address full price ask point

"First off, let me say that everyone has a right to their opinion. I am not here to say whether or not this game is right for anyone else as we are all in different life situations. It is, after all, a thing to do in our free time. Something to get our mind off of life for a while. So below is just ""my"" opinion on how I see this game. Hopefully it helps those who read it (along with any other reviews listed here) to come to their own conclusion. With all that being said, here are my thoughts..I have been a fan of Games workshop(GW) since the 80's. If you are familiar with the company, then you know they're not cheap. But their commitment to quality models has been stead fast, and my ""pile of shame"" grows ever larger. This statement shows that I am vested in this hobby and the lore. I don't believe every video game they have released has been great, far from it in fact. BUT Total War: Warhammer I, II, III is truly an amazing game! I have also been a big fan of the total war series since the original Shogun. I bought just about every game in the series and have spent hundreds hours playing them. So when I heard these two companies were coming together, it was a sure thing for me! Below are the hours I have spent on each game and to be honest I'm surprised they are as low as they are.TWW I - 751 hours*TWW II - 3016 hours*TWW III - 1044 hours**at time of this postingThis is a MASSIVE game that includes a least 24 races(not counting rogue armies or mods) with hopefully more to come. Within those races there are multiple factions, each with their own unique play style and goals. I'm pretty sure Creative Assembly(CA) & GW plan on reaching 100 faction leaders! This itself creates an incredible amount of replay ability. Now not all of them you may like, but with such variety, there's something in here for everyone's taste and play style. CA has done an epic job bringing all this together in one massive ""immortal empires map"". They game can be played as a giant sandbox but GW has so much rich lore that there is a story to follow as well. DLCs were also released with certain factions leaders squaring off with each other which helps with the immersion. The environments in this world are rich and ever expanding with the possibility of Ind, Kuresh, & Nippon opening up in the future. And if that wasn't enough, the AMAZING modding community has such mods as ""Dynamic World"" to enrich it more.As far as game play, as mentioned above, I was very familiar with Total War game mechanics. So it was very easy to jump right in. For those of you that haven't played any of the series before(whats wrong with you?? jk jk), it may take a little getting use to, but in ""my opinion"" it is very intuitive on how it works. There are so many reviews on this page that I wont get into everything here but if you are interested I'm sure you can find another review that goes into it in more detail.Now, to address the elephant in the room: the cost.. By now I have said enough about myself that you can tell price isn't a wall for me if I love the product. I can spend WAY more going out these days for this many hours of entertainment (listed above) then what this game has costed me. $237.00* / 4811 series hours played = $0.05 per hr*Price of all available TWW I, II & III content, 10% off (not including Thrones of Decay)I'm sure my math may be off a little but even if it was 10x that amount its worth every cent. And the more I play, the more value I get from it. My suggestion is to wait for a sale and start small. A large part of the player base plays Empire but do your research to see which race sounds most interesting to you. You will need to buy one of the base games to start with and with ""Thrones of Decay""(ToD) release right around the corner, all of the base and DLCs will be on sale (good time to jump in!) I've seen the base game I & II up to 50% off in the past. But don't feel pressured to buy all the content at once. For those of you still on the fence, remember steam has that return window policy if you don't like it within the first few days.If I have any complaint about the game, its the series has been so good that I have had trouble playing any of the old Total War historic games since due to the lack of variety in the factions/game play. I remember this being a worry from the Total War historic community before its release and now I see why. Yes, there are some bugs in the game but none of them are game breaking. Most of the time I didnt even notice them until I read the hot fixes. We need to remember few games have ever been this massive before and with all the new content these things can take time. You tube content creators, such as Great Book of Grudges, and the player base are always sure the devs are made aware of these so they are fixed. Maybe not as fast as they would like but again I barely notice them. I will make this part quick.. You may have heard the recent drama over the ""Shadows of Change""(SoC) DLC and all the negativity along with it. I will say the player base stood up for what they felt was right, and I ""believe"" CA finally got the message. The extra content added to SoC DLC and the previews for ToD are looking like a move in the right direction to make the game community supportive again. But only time will tell.So in conclusion I want to again say this is only ""my opinion"". I am not saying anyone complaining this game is to expensive for them is wrong. What I am saying is that I am willing to pay developers that will bring high level of entertainment and will continue to support them so it keeps coming out. Yes, we should make sure we are keeping the developers honest and the quality of product they are releasing is held at a high standard. But in a respectful and productive way.

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

"1 of the best games I every played but honestly the pricing for the dlc contet, most of which should be free makes me kinda hate this company for their insatiable greed and even tho I want and can afford to buy more classes to play I refuse.Once you finish the campaign you want more and jump into mortal empires, but to get any more races to play you gonna have to start to bleed your wallet, to get all the races from the previous games the cost is around 180 euro, which is on top of the already 60 euro you payed for this game. If all the classes from the previous games were included for free or at a heavily reduced price I would be happy to pay for all the new dlc they put out just to support the game. But 19Euro for the wood elves or 3,5 euro for blood effects for a warhammer game?

"2022 Ideal. A great blend of exploration, skillful combat, freedom, level design, RPG stat/build nerding, immersion, itemization, and storytelling. The open world is comprised of mindful, intentional design, creating a sense of pacing within the fully player-driven exploration experience. It never seems to end, just when you think the game has played all of its cards and will start slowing down, it delivers over and over again. The main dungeons are an experience to behold, often giant towering structures you work your way towards, each of them a feat in level and art design. The character building possibilities are awesome, the game rewards experimentation and critical analysis of your build in ways Souls games never quite nailed down. The gameplay loop is varied and addicting, equal parts exploration, analysis, experimentation, and engaging, responsive combat. It's a huge well-designed & high budget immersive world in an RPG that puts game design & gameplay mechanics first, with an intriguing story that never gets in the way... and it doesn't compromise on difficulty. The controls and movement are responsive (thanks Sekiro), the animations are good, the art and vfx are real nice.If you have any interest in the excitement of discovering a game's world and mechanics, you owe it to yourself to play this game blindly, with minimal outside influence and wiki'ing—the game supports blind play very well, though it will be worthwhile to take basic notes in a journal or notepad file. I think a player written in-game journal or world map editor are my primary desires, but I'm just gonna blame consoles for the lack of these types of features. as they're hard to implement there.Ultimately though, this game gives back what you put in. If you want to progress slowly, exploring every inch of the world to find lots of meaningful secrets and items, it delivers as an incredible open world game. If you want to rush the legacy dungeons, creating a challenging experience by killing all the main bosses with a more limited option set, it delivers as a good action game. If you want to optimize your build, nerding out testing tons of setups and different viable strategies, engaging with the stats, spells, and itemization, it has tons of interesting stuff to play around with and delivers as a solid RPG. If you want to simply play at a medium pace, learning about the world, challenging some bosses, running random dungeons you come across, making your character stronger with the stuff you happen to find, and primarily letting your whims guide you—All of that will be engaging and rewarded. If you're a pure PVP nerd, maybe try showering someday, but yeah that's here too and it seems OK so far.I don't know how FromSoft did it, but they took the ""git gud"" approach to developing games and simply killed it. They deliver on not just a single intended experience, but an array of experiences, intentionally playing into the best aspects of emergent game design, while maintaining strong encounter and level design... All wrapped in some nerdy open world fantasy RPG that learns important lessons from all their previously developed games. My sincere thanks to Miyazaki & the whole FromSoftware team for their hard work, expertise, and dedication to making big budget gameplay driven games.(♥♥♥ george tho)",ideal great blend explor skill combat freedom level design rpg statbuild nerd immers item storytel open world compris mind intent design creat sens pace within fulli playerdriven explor experi never seem end think game play card start slow deliv main dungeon experi behold often giant tower structur work way toward feat level art design charact build possibl awesom game reward experiment critic analysi build way soul game never quit nail gameplay loop vari addict equal part explor analysi experiment engag respons combat huge welldesign high budget immers world rpg put game design gameplay mechan first intrigu stori never get way doesnt compromis difficulti control movement respons thank sekiro anim good art vfx real niceif interest excit discov game world mechan owe play game blindli minim outsid influenc wikiingth game support blind play well though worthwhil take basic note journal notepad file think player written ingam journal world map editor primari desir im gon na blame consol lack type featur theyr hard implement thereultim though game give back put want progress slowli explor everi inch world find lot meaning secret item deliv incred open world game want rush legaci dungeon creat challeng experi kill main boss limit option set deliv good action game want optim build nerd test ton setup differ viabl strategi engag stat spell item ton interest stuff play around deliv solid rpg want simpli play medium pace learn world challeng boss run random dungeon come across make charact stronger stuff happen find primarili let whim guid youall engag reward your pure pvp nerd mayb tri shower someday yeah that seem ok fari dont know fromsoft took git gud approach develop game simpli kill deliv singl intend experi array experi intent play best aspect emerg game design maintain strong encount level design wrap nerdi open world fantasi rpg learn import lesson previous develop game sincer thank miyazaki whole fromsoftwar team hard work expertis dedic make big budget gameplay driven game georg tho

"One of those games that needs a ""meh"" middle option. - Campaign is mediocre, individual missions and encounters feel kinda lazy, outdated in design and extremely repetetive. - Enemy AI is extremly basic, most enemies have just 1-2 attacks, bosses maybe 3-4. - Dialogue is kinda lazy and basic, even by cliche 40k standards. - Environments are kinda 40kish, but not enough. Like they're just a tiny step above generic sci fi coridor shooter. - Enemies are bullet spongy as hell. Combat seems to take ""inspiration"" from dark souls (like literally everything these days..) but just doesnt work with tyranids as the enemy. On veteran (which the game says is the intended difficulty) one hit will take out 50-80% of your hp, while it takes like 10-20 hits to kill the same basic non-boss enemy that hit you. While trash mobs are swarming and stunning you. Its just grindy, tiring and feels like ♥♥♥♥ even after you beat every encounter. Kinda like dark souls 2. - Ranged enemies swarm you and seem to target only the player. - Companion AI i atrociously dumb, but game seems to be designed purelly around coop. enemy hp etc. - Controls feel unresponsive, there's a wierd delay on most things. Especially bad with melee which as a result feel really bad. - AI straight up bugs out in places and does effectivelly or literally nothing - Lots a of different guns with very slightly different names that all feel almost identical - Sounds of SMs walking are ♥♥♥♥, instead of tanks, they're barbies in slipers. - Gun sounds are meh too --- A narative driven sp game designed entirelly around coop mp, even the campaign. In 2024. Seriously? ----- Whoever keeps putting in ""hold button to do action"" ♥♥♥♥ in video games needs to be publicly excecuted as warning to the next 15 generations. That ♥♥♥♥ doesnt even belong in console games, and is the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing since motion blur in pc games. + Visuals are good + Shooting is mostly satisfying despite meh gun sounds + Its 40k, and you're a space marine fighting xenos + Voice acting is reasonably good.

"2023 Im deeply upset to see the way that C.A. has decided to manage the property this late into a trilogy. The times of WH1 and WH2 were filled with fantastic content and much needed maintenance that made the games continually fun to return to over months and years. However, with WH3, C.A. has seemed to change course. The game has been littered with crippling bugs in the AI, the combat, and the lords that have made many aspects significantly less fun that previous titles. This alone wouldn't kill the my interest, as the variety of potential content has always renewed my interest in the game, but that too has fallen into disarray with the pricing changes. With the announcement of their new pricing structure, content that would have previously been in the range of $10-$15 is now $25, with the expectation that will be the standard going forward.Again, alone that wouldnt kill my interest in the game; Had the price change been matched with higher quality and consistent bug fixes like during the duration of WH2 I would have been more than accepting of it. But together though, these two problems create a game that is neither as fun as it once was, nor a good value for the content.With that in mind I have to sadly say that any individual seeking to get into the WH games should just get WH2 on steep discount, and avoid WH3 completely.",im deepli upset see way ca decid manag properti late trilog time fill fantast content much need mainten made game continu fun return month year howev ca seem chang cours game litter crippl bug ai combat lord made mani aspect significantli less fun previou titl alon wouldnt kill interest varieti potenti content alway renew interest game fallen disarray price chang announc new price structur content would previous rang expect standard go forwardagain alon wouldnt kill interest game price chang match higher qualiti consist bug fix like durat would accept togeth though two problem creat game neither fun good valu contentwith mind sadli say individu seek get wh game get steep discount avoid complet

"2023 With a total of 340 hours poured into WH2 and 166 hours into WH3, not to mention over a thousand hours across all the total war games, it's disheartening to witness what feels like CA's decline. The game itself is fun, yet the direction CA is taking has left me deeply disappointed. The pricing strategy for their DLCs is beyond my comprehension. Despite my consistent support by purchasing DLCs upon release, the recent two DLCs have been priced at an astonishing $25 each. In all honesty, when evaluating the content they offer, this pricing appears not worthy at all.The thought of spending $50 for just two DLCs is perplexing. Why wouldn't I consider buying Baldur's Gate 3 instead? The repeated assurances that each new DLC will introduce an entirely fresh journey led me to maintain faith in the development team. However, it's becoming evident that CA does not care about player at all. Their insatiable greed is devouring their once vibrant creativity. ""Shadows of Change"" will be my last DLC, unless substantial improvements are made.It's truly disheartening. I believed that CA aimed to craft a gaming experience that would be treasured, a journey etched into players' memories. Yet, it seems that the pursuit of profit has overshadowed that vision.YOU WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY? THATS FINE, I GET IT. BUT WHAT YOU DO IS NOT MAKING MORE MONEY.

"2022 Well if you have Warhammer 2 there is no point in buying this game unless you want to take advantage of the up to 8 player multiplayer campaign. This game has no selling point other than that. There is no blood and gore dlc because there is no blood and gore at all. Unit animations seem even clunkier than before. Overall the game isn't terrible. Runs great but there is no graphical advancement whatsoever. Also what the actual ♥♥♥♥ are these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unit sizes. On ultra the most men you will have in a unit is 120 and that's a ♥♥♥♥ tier unit. On ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ultra. Not even 160. ""Have epic scale battles"" Where sir? Where's the epic scale because what I see is a joke. Medieval 2 total war makes a mockery of you in unit scale let alone the modded versions of the game. And that game came out before 2010. It's over a decade after that and the unit sizes are worse. What a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke. There is a seeming bug that doesn't always occur but occurs about half the time where your single entity units (mostly your commanders) just stop fighting and stand there getting wailed on no matter how many times you click to disengage or to fight.Building cards are as abysmal and devoid of soul as always. But what else should we expect from CA? They gave up on making quality total wars over a decade ago. Same ♥♥♥♥ as always.

"Game of the Year It's been awhile since I played a game that had me hooked to the point I couldn't stop playing. The combat is fluid, the environment is beautiful, the levelling up system is fun to explore, and unlocking new gear not only makes you look badass but also helps you along your journey. Why is combat so fun? Well, you get to capture the souls of monsters that you have defeated and use their skills; you can also transform into bosses you have defeated, and you get to pick which fighting stance to suit your playstyle. All stances can be changed on the fly during combat too. And you get a magic spell on top. Anyone telling you the combat is boring doesn't know what they are talking about.Is this a Soul's-like game? No, but it does have soul-like elements, such as Flask/Gourd, Bonfire/Shrines, and enemies respawn with huge boss battles. If you ever feel put off if this game is too difficult, worry not; I'd say this game is challenging at best and do-able once you practice perfect dodge. Why is this my game of the year? For a start, the music in this game is amazing, from the combat to the story telling and how it hits on the right keynotes for that crescendo moment. Watching the end of the Chapter 5 cutscene and listening to the song, it really fits perfectly when the cord and vocals play out in each scene. Not only was the music amazing, but the art direction, too. Having different styles of art for every cutscene was a fantastic choice. It draws so much attention. I do like how the end of chapter 2 cutscene foreshadows a side mission in the game... Well done, Game Science. That was my favourite side mission. You would think fighting bosses after bosses would get tiresome, but Black Myth manages to make a game where each boss fight feels fascinating and fun. So many times when I play a game, it's just a reskin boss battle with the same attack from a previous level, but not the Black Myth. Each boss fight has their own unique attacks, and it just feels so fresh to see in a video game. Not only is the boss battle exciting, but all the monster designs look interesting too. I had fun reading up about them in your monster encyclopaedia book. This better win an award for music and art direction. The ControversyFollowing Black Myth Wukong from the beginning, it has been so frustrating to see how unfairly treated this game has gotten from journalists, gaming journalists, and even a few content creators, for that matter. For those who are smart enough to know the whole controversy and how obvious it has become once you piece the dots together. DEI asks for money; said company makes DEI friends slander Game Science *Cough IGN*, every news outlet spread it like wildfire, gaming media reviewers purposely give games a low score, and on top of that, it clearly shows they never played beyond chapter 2. To have DEI in Black Myth Wukong would truly break the art in this game. Not only art but the Asian culture and the essence that is rich in its history. It’s ""wrong"" to include DEI principles in a game based on Journey to the West (a classic Chinese novel); there is cultural authenticity that has historical context that is deeply rooted in Chinese culture and mythology.You also have to respect the artistic vision. Game Science wanted their game to be told. It's their story, their culture, and no outside influence has the right to tell them what to do. It's a game that started from passion. It's also been frustrating to see some content creators turning a blind eye to Black Myth, to either no mention, no coverage, downplaying the game, or no mention how it has broken records and sold X amount of copies and made X amount of millions. Shamefully, even Easy Allies didn't even cover this game, and they were more hyped for Concord, lol. This game is more than just Game of the Year. It has been through a lot, and yet, despite it all, I'm sad to say, it will get snubbed at the Gaming Awards, and if it does, then you and I know, it was rigged. I can't wait for the DLC; it will smash more records to come.

"I originally had very positive thoughts on this game, but once I found out that they take everything from you after their season ends & I mean they take everything that matters. The only things you get to keep is your journey completion << I think, but not sure on that one, some blueprints, character cosmetics, formulas for your house cosmetics to not be mistaken for the memetic portions & if you knew how or remembered to create it you also get to keep your house blueprint/s, that starchrom, star source, Mitsukos Mark, sproutlet, planula, oh & any friends that you made that stuck around. Now it may let you keep other stuff as well, but since I have a job & a family the other stuff you get to keep was probably something I didn't have time to obtain or even educate myself on within the game. Now the game is pretty & has a lot of in-game content...& if you have real life work & priorities you will never be able to get it all done in 6 weeks *^5*. When the servers reset you are forced to tag along & when you fall into the new server you're starting over from scratch. This means you're pretty much playing the game from the beginning all over again & again & again & again & again & again ""Oh my how fun"". This is a game with no end, no middle & no progression that matters since your progression & all your hard work & many hours spent in it is taken from you with a ""Haha"" by the creators. You don't get a new world to explore & you get the same enemies, the same missions, the same NPCs, the same everything with a few different missions but who knows maybe those are the same to since you didn't complete the first part lol. They treat you like you're stupid by making you complete the same tasks as if you could ever forget how to create a base, at least give us a ""I've done this effin ♥♥♥♥ already let me skip"". Yet because of the wipes there is 0 motivation to even play it. Wipes make more sense for Pvp not for Pve......the fact that we lose our levels & map progression in an mmo is extremely stupid. 6 weeks is not enough time.....a lot of us have jobs & families we can't live on Once Human for 13-20 hours a day. So yes if you have no obligations in real life & you've no job....sure go for it you will be able to play & complete it within the 6 weeks before they f**k you again. I honestly don't think it's worth it since you're not really getting anything new for all of the time you put into the grind. So my final outlook on the game is from their mindset ""MMOs are hard to keep up with so lets just not really give anything to them that's new, not give them enough time to complete the world & then take it all so they're forced to spend time on it but we're not forced with the task of giving new content as often."" Since for most of you that play MMOs the one thing they seem to struggle with is the upkeep of engaging content that can keep up the majority of it's player base, so perhaps this is their attempt of ""keeping it fresh"". All in all I'm very disappointed & was hoping that I finally came across a good MMO/survival, but I was mistake....hopefully they make some changes...maybe they can separate PVE from PVP & players can only achieve the battle pass content if they create a PVP character & grind for their battle pass content there....but still have the freedom to play the game in PVE as normal where we cannot grind for the battle pass content. Just a thought that I hope they consider.",origin posit thought game found take everyth season end mean take everyth matter thing get keep journey complet think sure one blueprint charact cosmet formula hous cosmet mistaken memet portion knew rememb creat also get keep hous blueprint starchrom star sourc mitsuko mark sproutlet planula oh friend made stuck around may let keep stuff well sinc job famili stuff get keep probabl someth didnt time obtain even educ within game game pretti lot ingam content real life work prioriti never abl get done week server reset forc tag along fall new server your start scratch mean your pretti much play game begin oh fun game end middl progress matter sinc progress hard work mani hour spent taken haha creator dont get new world explor get enemi mission npc everyth differ mission know mayb sinc didnt complet first part lol treat like your stupid make complet task could ever forget creat base least give us ive done effin alreadi let skip yet wipe motiv even play wipe make sens pvp pveth fact lose level map progress mmo extrem stupid week enough timea lot us job famili cant live human hour day ye oblig real life youv jobsur go abl play complet within week fk honestli dont think worth sinc your realli get anyth new time put grind final outlook game mindset mmo hard keep let realli give anyth that new give enough time complet world take theyr forc spend time forc task give new content often sinc play mmo one thing seem struggl upkeep engag content keep major player base perhap attempt keep fresh im disappoint hope final came across good mmosurviv mistakehop make changesmayb separ pve pvp player achiev battl pass content creat pvp charact grind battl pass content therebut still freedom play game pve normal grind battl pass content thought hope consid
"2023 CA has decided that after 3 years of hyping up Warhammer 3 as the cherry on the top that would complete the experience of all 3 games to throw that all away for the chance to squeeze your last dime, and threaten to hold it hostage if you don't. Don't like that and think it's scummy, too bad they'll just make up some excuses about ""rising development costs"" entirely forgetting they have free marketing through youtubers, they also don't have to produce a physical product since it's downloaded over the internet. They also expect you to not realize that they made almost $2 Billion in revenue off of just the first 6 months of Warhammer 3 sales. All this in the name of further development, but this game lacks solid features that old total wars still shine 15 years later from having. Dark elf corsairs, Vampire coast pirates, and the Norscan raiders can't actually participate in naval battles as naval capable factions in the lore. Remember when trade was physically represented on the campaign map by carts and ships moving from one city to another and could be raided. Remember when you could recruit units without a general so you could make custom garrisons for your cities. Don't forget what CA stripped Total war of in the name of selling you less product for more money while hoping you wouldn't pay attention, and don't forget that they'll do it again in a heartbeat,just like they are now.",ca decid year hype warhamm cherri top would complet experi game throw away chanc squeez last dime threaten hold hostag dont dont like think scummi bad theyll make excus rise develop cost entir forget free market youtub also dont produc physic product sinc download internet also expect realiz made almost billion revenu first month warhamm sale name develop game lack solid featur old total war still shine year later dark elf corsair vampir coast pirat norscan raider cant actual particip naval battl naval capabl faction lore rememb trade physic repres campaign map cart ship move one citi anoth could raid rememb could recruit unit without gener could make custom garrison citi dont forget ca strip total war name sell less product money hope wouldnt pay attent dont forget theyll heartbeatjust like

This is, however, not my favorite Total War.

"2022 UPDATE: 08/23/2022 - Alright, so finally they fixed the performance issues with the release of immortal empire and the lighting in the game seems better overall along with many, many improvements to the game in all aspects. Also, immortal empires is now available. At this point I would give the green light. Flipping this review to positive.I'll be honest. I loved Warhammer 2 and accumulated 1200+ hours of gameplay. Perfection. This one, however, was not ready to be released yet. The optimization is abysmal. It feels like a closed beta with access for those who paid. Also the anti-aliasing in this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ugly. You are stuck with FXAA or TAA, which is basically; ""Do you want flicker everywhere? Or do you want vaseline screen?"" It blows my mind that a PC-only released, in 2022, with an AAA stamp offers only those 2 outdated and ugly forms of AA. The color palete is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up too, which I don't know if it's the result of the incredibly ugly AA or just bad work on art department, but something feels very, very off.I have a Ryzen 5800X paired with a 3070, and well configured pair of RAM sticks with tight timings running the game on a m.2 storage, and it's not enough to run this game well. Battles are okay, but in minor settlement there is a micro stutter that won't go away, even though the FPS is above 60. On campaign map your FPS gets tanked hard, no matter the config you use.Just do yourself a favor and go buy Elden Ring or something, and wait for 2 or 3 months until they optimize this. Don't get me wrong, I love this game, but it was simply not ready to be released.When they finally optimize it properly I will change my review to positive.

"2014 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter and the next generation of Counter-Strike running on updated Source Engine and has many new features added.The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. No need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further.Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system.Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving.

"2022 **SPOILER FREE** I've put thousands of hours into the FromSoft games over the years, so to say I was hyped for this would be putting it lightly. Somehow... Someway.. This game has managed to blow straight past all my expectations. This is the 'Ali vs Liston' of heavyweight, triple A RPGs. The 'Prince at the Superbowl halftime 2007' of creative ingenuity. La piece de resistance for anyone looking for something fresh and exciting to seriously shake up the monotonous genre that is currently open world games. The ONLY complaint I've had is to do with the performance issues on PC. Which as of the current patch, have been ironed out for the most part.From a Souls fan perspective, this game is absolute bliss. If you've ever found yourself lamenting for a small quality of life change in one of their games before, I assure you its now a part of Elden Ring. For a first time Souls player, this game offers a godlike first taste into the incredible games this company has to offer.Every new mechanic is incredibly thought out and flawlessly executed. At the core, the combat is very much DS3. But, that's a good thing. Too many games nowadays try to reinvent the wheel and end up just over complicating things. Instead, From stuck to their roots, and managed to add these incredible layers to the combat. There are honestly infinite ways to tackle a fight in Elden Ring, and here's the best part... They're basically ALL viable. This game allows you to push through enemies in exactly the way you want to.The open world is not a hybrid, it's not half-assed. It's rich in content and aesthetically jaw dropping. It flows effortlessly and in a way that constantly has you exclaiming 'wow this game is HUGE,' but without overwhelming you. And in some feat of genius, they've managed to incorporate the crazy satisfying Miyazaki vertical level design in a way that just WORKS. This is their first open world attempt. FromSoft do not miss, these guys just don't miss.The story is really, really good. And much easier to follow than their previous games, but the lore still isn't force-fed to you so if you're the kind of player that just likes to get to the slaying, you're covered. The NPC quest lines are the most immersive they've ever been with such engaging and unique characters, and they're so impactful. Makes them very worth following.The difficulty is done amazingly well. The game is exactly as hard as you make it without having to resort to some artificial difficulty slider. The more dedicated exploring and build creating that you do, the more powerful your character becomes, and in turn, the easier the game becomes. The late game difficulty spike is also very welcome. The final bosses really FEEL like super powerful demigods that require you to bust out everything you have to match their power.The general design in this game is on a different level to anything I've ever seen. I was constantly taken aback by the sheer 'cool factor' of bosses and various enemies. The side areas had me in complete awe constantly. A single side area felt like a whole DLC on many occasions, as the design was just immaculate and so thorough.Also worth a mention - both the voice acting and the sound design/score are phenomenal. They amassed a team of really talented voice actors and musicians to create this immense audio immersion that just has you taken aback constantly. This is a game you can play in a thousand different ways, for a different experience every time. And for 50 GBP it's a damn good deal. I cannot recommend it enough.10/10",spoiler free ive put thousand hour fromsoft game year say hype would put lightli somehow someway game manag blow straight past expect ali vs liston heavyweight tripl rpg princ superbowl halftim creativ ingenu la piec de resist anyon look someth fresh excit serious shake monoton genr current open world game complaint ive perform issu pc current patch iron partfrom soul fan perspect game absolut bliss youv ever found lament small qualiti life chang one game assur part elden ring first time soul player game offer godlik first tast incred game compani offereveri new mechan incred thought flawlessli execut core combat much that good thing mani game nowaday tri reinvent wheel end complic thing instead stuck root manag add incred layer combat honestli infinit way tackl fight elden ring here best part theyr basic viabl game allow push enemi exactli way want toth open world hybrid halfass rich content aesthet jaw drop flow effortlessli way constantli exclaim wow game huge without overwhelm feat geniu theyv manag incorpor crazi satisfi miyazaki vertic level design way work first open world attempt fromsoft miss guy dont missth stori realli realli good much easier follow previou game lore still isnt forcef your kind player like get slay your cover npc quest line immers theyv ever engag uniqu charact theyr impact make worth followingth difficulti done amazingli well game exactli hard make without resort artifici difficulti slider dedic explor build creat power charact becom turn easier game becom late game difficulti spike also welcom final boss realli feel like super power demigod requir bust everyth match powerth gener design game differ level anyth ive ever seen constantli taken aback sheer cool factor boss variou enemi side area complet awe constantli singl side area felt like whole dlc mani occas design immacul thoroughalso worth mention voic act sound designscor phenomen amass team realli talent voic actor musician creat immens audio immers taken aback constantli game play thousand differ way differ experi everi time gbp damn good deal recommend

"2022 Product received for free Spoiler Free:If you played the past Total War and/or Warhammer titles, you are in for an absolute treat. TW:WIII is at the top of its game, being one of the best experiences in the series thus far. Honestly, if nothing else, the unit rosters and their diversity alone makes it a far better experience. Doom stacking is less of a meta, and most units are multi roled. The new siege system is an interesting take and definitely expands on the past sieges, though it could be a little more intriguing - the supply & defense building system leaves a little to be desired, but is definitely better than not having it at all. The story-line and campaign is amazing, the Daemon Prince campaign is an absolute treat with unparalleled lord customization that sold me immediately. The game overall feels more intelligent, the AI respond better overall around the map, the land mass really does push you away from some factions nearly the whole game as well. Really, this is just a good title - if its your first in the series, its a great one to begin with.Also, the game runs VERY smooth - I am on a i7 7700K 4.2 ghz, 1080ti and 16gb Ram and its running perfectly - load times are a little high, but nothing terrible.I am also fairly easy to please with the Total War titles, my experience and likes/dislikes will ultimately be different than yours.

"2022 The posibilities how to start this review are numerous. But i think to adress the biggest change to what fromsoft has done before let's talk about...THE OPEN-WORLDEven though this is Fromsoft's first shot at a real open-world, they did an amazing job with it. The first time I started up the game and came into the open world I just got lost in it. Not like I didn't know where to go because while the game doesn't give you specific directions in form of waypoints, some points of grace (that's what the bonfires/checkpoints are called in this game) have rays of light attatched to them which point in the direction where the story countinues.But no what i meant with getting lost is that i could just ride around in the open-world forgetting about time and just roaming around stumbling from one quest into another, finding dungeons, fighting fieldbosses and before you know it, you rode your trusty horse torrent around for 4 hours. You may not have countinued the story and yet, it's not at all like you didnt do anthing in this time.Elden Ring really does reward exploring of the world. Be it more healing items you can pick up or another area you wouldnt have expected. In one of the first forests I explored I happened to stumble upon a circle shaped building. I didnt think much of it at the time since i was on my way to a castle I spotted on the horizon. After examining the castle I went back to that building I passed in the forest, which i marked on the map so I wouldnt forget about it (I can only recommend to take advantage of the marker tool since you might forget some points of interest with this much to see in the world). Turns out the building was an elevator and brought me far down below the plains I wandered before. On the ride down the wall before me opend up a bit and revealed an underground area with a sky made of sparkling gems resting above it. This is only one of the stunning views you get to see while exploring. Traveling the lands between is not fun and games though. Of course, in these chaotic times the world is littered with enemies. Not just grunts but bosses like giant knights on armored horses or dragons as well. While you encounter most bosses in dungeons you shouldn't go around with a sense of security since although grunts, may just be grunts they are deadly grunts. While we're on the topic let's get into...THE COMBATFor those of you who didn't have the pleasure to enjoy any of the dark souls games yet, I'll just give a quick summary of the most used combat strategie: You look how the enemie is winding up their attack, wait for the strike and then dodge through it. After successfully avoiding the attack you either have a short opportunity to deal damage, which consists for most players just spaming the rb button, or have to dodge out of the way of the next attack. If you didn't time your roll right it's retreat and heal. That's basically what combat consisted of in the dark souls games. The third installment of the series introduced also something called weapon arts. Weapon arts are possesed by every weapon in the game and are a unique move of attack that uses up mana. In Dark Souls III I personally rarely used it tho since the risk-reward factor of hitting such an attack to the damage it dealt just wasn't worth it.In Elden Ring some major improvements were made even though Fromsoft might have overdone it in some aspects. The one thing that is responsible for the biggest change in combat is the new poise stat, that was added by the devs. You can imagine poise as another bar besides the health bar. When it runs out the enemy gets staggered and you get to perform a critical strike that deals massive damage (It is simmular to sekiro but differs in that you cant actually see the bar). How does that change the gameplay you might ask yourself now. Well it gets the player to vary their attacks more. As already mentioned combat mostly relied on the rb button or light attack. Light attacks don't do much damage to the poise of an enemy though. So the player has to decide if they solely want to rely on the damage of their light attacks or risk a longer heavy attack to not only deal damage but bring down the enemy's poise as well. Over all you can play Elden Ring combat whise just like the old dark souls games but there is a good new alternative.The Weapon skills are where Fromsoft might have overdone it a little. There are two or three weapons in the game which let you one shot some bosses or just let you cancel enemies attacks, making some passages a bit too easy in my opinion. If you dont want this you can of course just leave your fingers off of 'em.In conclusion, combat whise Elden Ring improved on Dark Souls and Sekiro massively as well.Last but not least there is still one thing left...THE STORYI'm sad to say, the story is probably not going to be something for everyone. In typical Fromsoft manner, you don't just get the story presented on a silver plate. You have a main story line and yet it might confuse you in some parts. The story is told, not just with cutscenes but with item descriptions, side quests, and dots you have to connect by yourself. The game tells the tales of many dark but also some brighter fates. Be it the swordswoman malenia just trying to desperately protect her brother. Or General Rahdan rotten but Malenia's curse, seeking out one last battle, worthy of a warrior's death and not perish from sickness. All of which, you kinda have to figure out for yourself.To sum it all up: Fromsoft created a masterpiece. They did hell of a job on their open-world and designed their bosses with just as much passion and creativity. The exploring always stays interesting and the combat is very enjoyable. The combination of all this makes up this addicting magnum opus of a game.In my opinion this is a must play title and i can only recommend it to everyone considering getting it just the slightest.

"5 Out of 10 game, wait for it to go on sale. (also ignore my playtime it is much longer than steam shows).Visually this game is quite impressive, they really nailed the look and feel of the 40k Imperium. Audio is really good, voice acting is good.Where this game falls flat on its face is in the amount of content, and the game-play.This game is extremely bare bones for a 70$ AAA game. The campaign is short, there are only 6 PvE missions, and there is PvP, which I do not really care much about and am not reviewing. The weapon selection is ok at best.Combat is extremely basic, guns feel weak as hell, and this gets worse and worse with difficulty as the enemies get even more bullet spongy with each increase in difficulty. It can take multiple magazines to down a single medium sized enemy at max difficulty. Bolters (incredibly powerful weapons in lore) feel like you are shooting 22 rimfire. Ammo availability also decreases dramatically with difficulty, which ultimately makes most guns worthless.Melee combat is slow and clunky, and your marine feels like their armor is made out of paper. Dodge red attacks, parry and counter yellow attacks, time your dodge or parry and you can counter or shoot your target in the head with your pistol. Executions are ok but often take too long. You get armor from doing executions, otherwise basically lifted from recent doom games.The game loves to mix ranged and melee enemies together so you are often getting shot to bits while being swarmed by in close enemies. Enemies and friendlies can both attack and shoot through each other, so the ranged enemies are in no way blocked by close enemies.PvE is also very grindy and time consuming for improving your character and unlocking new armor bits. Missions are long but uninteresting. Go here, defend that, hit this button, go here, etc.The expansions are also a ripoff in my opinion. Entirely cosmetic, and you have to grind a ton to unlock the cosmetics to actually use them. The price of the season pass is also a joke for what you get. Plus if you want the full set of cosmetics for all weapons, you better have preorederd the Ultra Edition.It is a pity as this game has a lot of potential, but it is ruined by greed and a very bare bones launch.",game wait go sale also ignor playtim much longer steam showsvisu game quit impress realli nail look feel imperium audio realli good voic act goodwher game fall flat face amount content gameplaythi game extrem bare bone aaa game campaign short pve mission pvp realli care much review weapon select ok bestcombat extrem basic gun feel weak hell get wors wors difficulti enemi get even bullet spongi increas difficulti take multipl magazin singl medium size enemi max difficulti bolter incred power weapon lore feel like shoot rimfir ammo avail also decreas dramat difficulti ultim make gun worthlessmele combat slow clunki marin feel like armor made paper dodg red attack parri counter yellow attack time dodg parri counter shoot target head pistol execut ok often take long get armor execut otherwis basic lift recent doom gamesth game love mix rang mele enemi togeth often get shot bit swarm close enemi enemi friendli attack shoot rang enemi way block close enemiespv also grindi time consum improv charact unlock new armor bit mission long uninterest go defend hit button go etcth expans also ripoff opinion entir cosmet grind ton unlock cosmet actual use price season pass also joke get plu want full set cosmet weapon better preorederd ultra editionit piti game lot potenti ruin greed bare bone launch

"2022 I wanted to wait to write this, but seeming as though there will be no content updates for potentially another 6 months. (Q2 2023 as CA says) I thought it would be a good time to inform those of you who scour the depths of steam reviews before you purchase. If you're coming from Total War: Warhammer 2 to this and have not yet purchased, don't. If you're new to the Warhammer games or Total War in general, don't purchase this. Purchase Warhammer 2. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game in it's current state. There have been no improvements since Warhammer 2, in fact there have been many downgrades. This game is buggy, runs poorly, although better than launch. You cannot play Realms of Chaos (Main story for Warhammer 3) without wanting to commit seppuku. The quintessential experience for Warhammer will always be ""immortal empires"" a sandbox experience where hundreds of factions battle for world conquest. The only problem? The AI. I do not know what they did to this game in comparison to Warhammer 2, and I won't pretend I'm a game developer, but something is terribly wrong. You will be #1 in power ranking the entire campaign and there is almost no challenge, depending on the race you play and how verse you are in strategy. The AI puts up no fight, hides behind their walls, and refuse to expand. 150 turns into a Grimgor campaign (where I purposefully kept losing and giving territory) the second strongest faction was the empire. at 30 settlements. In comparison to my 100+. Needless to say, I with all my heart love Warhammer and I want this game to succeed. However, this game is a pure downgrade in GAMEPLAY. Which is what a game is all about. If you love pretty particles and a massive map (Bigger is better, i guess..) and have no care in the world for when you realize fatigue has been set in after your third campaign because there is no challenege or opposition, then this game is for you. If you adore a fun game with a ton of challenge, I HIGHLY recommend you purchase Warhammer 2 first. I truly want this game to flourish and there could be so much more to come if it does well, but that does not justify the games' current state.",want wait write seem though content updat potenti anoth month ca say thought would good time inform scour depth steam review purchas your come total war warhamm yet purchas dont your new warhamm game total war gener dont purchas purchas warhamm unfortun recommend game current state improv sinc warhamm fact mani downgrad game buggi run poorli although better launch play realm chao main stori warhamm without want commit seppuku quintessenti experi warhamm alway immort empir sandbox experi hundr faction battl world conquest problem ai know game comparison warhamm wont pretend im game develop someth terribl wrong power rank entir campaign almost challeng depend race play vers strategi ai put fight hide behind wall refus expand turn grimgor campaign purpos kept lose give territori second strongest faction empir settlement comparison needless say heart love warhamm want game succeed howev game pure downgrad gameplay game love pretti particl massiv map bigger better guess care world realiz fatigu set third campaign challeneg opposit game ador fun game ton challeng highli recommend purchas warhamm first truli want game flourish could much come well justifi game current state

"2022 At the moment this feels like a sidegrade to Total Warhammer II. The battles are entirely an improvement to II. If you consider the battles to be the meat of the game, then I believe this to be a great addition to the series and a welcome development of the gameplay. However, the campaign I feel is not in a great place. I would first like to say that I found the prologue a somewhat dull experience, as it holds your hand very firmly, does not provide a significant challenge, and felt very on rails. This being said the prologue campaign is exactly what a game of Total Warhammer's scope has always needed. A proper tutorial that shows many mechanics in a digestible way is very helpful. As a veteran player, I'm not the target audience and I'm very glad it exists.The main campaign has some very interesting ideas, and there is a lot about it I like. I love the art direction and clarity of design. Apart from all the red I think it's very readable, certainly more so than II. I love the little locations of interest on the map. I really like the concept of collecting souls, and visiting each god's realm. I like that the gameplay forces the player to be a little bit more proactive in recruiting and maintaining agents, keeping forces mobile, and pressuring the player with multiple fronts. But there are problems, which range from poor performance for some (I've been ok, but for a large amount of end-turn stutter and a couple of crashes), weak, redundant and pointless research trees, some bugged units and mechanics, and to problems more with how the campaign was laid out.My problem with the campaign as it exists is that is purely reactive gameplay. The player has no agency as to when the events happen, their length, and has very little agency in how to respond to the events. The player must send their most powerful army very quickly to a rift, to go to a Chaos Realm to get the macguffin, or otherwise the AI will get there before you and threaten to win the game eventually. You must close the rifts as quickly as possible, or they will cause so much corruption the penalties become incredibly damaging. I thought perhaps I could farm them for gold and xp, but the corruption penalties don't make it worthwhile. When you go to a Chaos Realm, the process (except for Khorne, fittingly) is very tedious. Each realm takes many turns to go through, and two of the realms have many teleports which consume all of your movement on activation. This means that much of the gameplay (especially in the Tzeentchian Realm gosh) is spent going to a teleport, finishing your turn, then maybe getting attacked by an army in the endturn. This wasn't so bad the first time! In fact, I thought it was pretty creative, and very slick in its implementation. But I'm on my third campaign now, and I've just got my second soul, and I don't want to do them any more. The repetition is getting to me. The goal of the campaign is just a slog. How the campaign is given to the player also removes all player agency. In much of the Total War series player agency impacts all levels of the game, from grand strategy to individual town management on the campaign map, to army composition and real time tactics in the battle screen. Where CA has received strong criticism in the past (Chaos invasion) it was related to player agency being broken in many examples. The Vortex Campaign for II is a good example of player agency being preserved, while the campaign is less mechanically interesting and more on-rails than the campaign in III (some of the DLC Vortex campaigns are the best campaigns in the entire Total War catalogue, both mechanically interesting and open ended). But I prefer the Vortex campaign at the moment. If this campaign gave some ability to influence or manipulate both when and where the Chaos incursions occur I think this campaign may have been better received. I mostly like the settlement battle rework. I do wish that some settlement battles were instead field battles. Maybe tier3 settlements or any defensive structure building rather than every settlement. I would prefer it if some of the maps were wider and that it was more clear what is terrain and what is traversable. Some of the tower placement is absolutely terrible, it's like they're traps for the player to sink currency into, which is feelbad gameplay. I would like wider streets so that I can actually place units properly instead of them autoplacing into bizarre thin regiments, and so that the units don't get into traffic jams. I would like them to immediately fix docked missile infantry not being able to fire. But broadly I like it, at its best it generates dynamic, flowing combats which are defender favoured, and at its worst it's kinda broken but at least different to a field battle. If you're a Total War, or Total Warhammer fan I've been having a lot of fun with it. Creative, diverse factions (if perhaps a little unit light) and some broad improvements to the series are a little let down by some odd and frustrating design choices and some lingering technical issues. It starts pretty good in my opinion, and it's only going to get better.If you're not already a fan, wait until the first round of DLC turns up and the game goes on special. But I've got a hundred hours already and my sleep has been ruined (one more turn) so it will certainly be worth it eventually.",moment feel like sidegrad total warhamm ii battl entir improv ii consid battl meat game believ great addit seri welcom develop gameplay howev campaign feel great place would first like say found prologu somewhat dull experi hold hand firmli provid signific challeng felt rail said prologu campaign exactli game total warhamm scope alway need proper tutori show mani mechan digest way help veteran player im target audienc im glad existsth main campaign interest idea lot like love art direct clariti design apart red think readabl certainli ii love littl locat interest map realli like concept collect soul visit god realm like gameplay forc player littl bit proactiv recruit maintain agent keep forc mobil pressur player multipl front problem rang poor perform ive ok larg amount endturn stutter coupl crash weak redund pointless research tree bug unit mechan problem campaign laid outmi problem campaign exist pure reactiv gameplay player agenc event happen length littl agenc respond event player must send power armi quickli rift go chao realm get macguffin otherwis ai get threaten win game eventu must close rift quickli possibl caus much corrupt penalti becom incred damag thought perhap could farm gold xp corrupt penalti dont make worthwhil go chao realm process except khorn fittingli tediou realm take mani turn go two realm mani teleport consum movement activ mean much gameplay especi tzeentchian realm gosh spent go teleport finish turn mayb get attack armi endturn wasnt bad first time fact thought pretti creativ slick implement im third campaign ive got second soul dont want repetit get goal campaign slog campaign given player also remov player agenc much total war seri player agenc impact level game grand strategi individu town manag campaign map armi composit real time tactic battl screen ca receiv strong critic past chao invas relat player agenc broken mani exampl vortex campaign ii good exampl player agenc preserv campaign less mechan interest onrail campaign iii dlc vortex campaign best campaign entir total war catalogu mechan interest open end prefer vortex campaign moment campaign gave abil influenc manipul chao incurs occur think campaign may better receiv mostli like settlement battl rework wish settlement battl instead field battl mayb settlement defens structur build rather everi settlement would prefer map wider clear terrain travers tower placement absolut terribl like theyr trap player sink currenc feelbad gameplay would like wider street actual place unit properli instead autoplac bizarr thin regiment unit dont get traffic jam would like immedi fix dock missil infantri abl fire broadli like best gener dynam flow combat defend favour worst kinda broken least differ field battl your total war total warhamm fan ive lot fun creativ divers faction perhap littl unit light broad improv seri littl let odd frustrat design choic linger technic issu start pretti good opinion go get betterif your alreadi fan wait first round dlc turn game goe special ive got hundr hour alreadi sleep ruin one turn certainli worth eventu

"2021 Counter Strike EnglishCounter Strike: Global Offensive is a very cool game. This game has everything a good shooter needs, lots of players, weapons, maps, modes. Above all, the game shines with its own system, which is a lot of fun and rewards good teamwork. In classic mode, anti-terrorists fight terrorists, the task of the terrorists is to place a bomb in one of the two locations (A or B on each map) and to protect it until it detonates. The task of the anti-terrorists is of course to prevent this. You can also simply kill all the players of a team to win a round. The teams are swapped after half of the match is played, this makes it very fair. It is worth using the voice chat to give your mates calls and tips. This way you can improve your English skills significantly (more than at school). Of course you sometimes meet people who are not nice and who have had a bad day, but that's the case in every game. All in all, CS: GO is a good tactical multiplayer shoter, which has remained good to this day. The advantages of this game outweigh the disadvantages. You can't go wrong with taking a look.GermanCounter Strike: Global Offensive ist ein sehr cooles Spiel. Dieses Spiel hat alles was ein guter Shooter benötigt, viele Spieler, Waffen, Karten und Modi. Dieses spiel glänzt vor allem mit seinem eigenen System, welches sehr viel Spaß macht und eine gute Teamarbeit belohnt. Im Klassischen Modus treten Anti-Terroristen gegen Terroristen an, die Aufgabe der Terroristen ist es dabei, eine Bombe an einem der beiden Orte (A oder B) zu platzieren und diese so lange zu beschützen bis sie detoniert. Die Aufgabe der Anti-Terroristen ist natürlich dies zu verhindern. Es können auch einfach alle spieler eines Teams können auch ganz einfach eliminiert werden, um eine Runde zu gwinnen. Die Teams werden nachdem die Hälfte des Match gespielt wurde gewechselt. Das macht es sehr fair. Es lohnt sich den voicechat zu verwenden, um seinen Mitspielern Calls und Tipps zu geben. So kann man sein Englisch deutlich verbessern (mehr als in der Schule).

Game is still plagued with crashes. It could be 10 minutes could be a hour. I've gone through every community guide to help fix it and any official release to attempt to resolve the issue. Latest patch did nothing to help fix it for me. Attempted to refund the game at around 9 hours of play time majority of which was spent trying to fix the stability of the game. Its unfortunate because the little I have actually played was great.,game still plagu crash could minut could hour ive gone everi commun guid help fix offici releas attempt resolv issu latest patch noth help fix attempt refund game around hour play time major spent tri fix stabil game unfortun littl actual play great

"2023 I cannot in good conscience recommend this game in its current state. I really enjoy the game, and believe you can too, but CA has gone out of control. We still have bugs from launch, and the updates aren't fixing them. If anything, updates and DLC's just add new ones in. Things that should be simple to fix are left unfixed, and things that are critical to gameplay are still issues. The fact that they are prioritizing releasing a new DLC and getting $25 out of you for the same amount of content that costs $10 in previous games, all while refusing to fix the underlying issues with the game are why I cannot recommend this to anyone. On top of that, the utter disrespect the community is getting from CA is unforgivable. The bans, the statements, none of that makes us feel like we are valued for what we are: paying customers. We are actively telling the company that we are unhappy and they need to do better, yet all we get is hostility and an implication that we should be grateful to them. I will no longer purchase any CA title or DLC until management recognizes their mistakes and walks back into a rhythm that garners respect from the paying customers, or they are removed. There is no way I am supporting the current mentality in any company. These games aren't a basic necessity, they're a luxury. They better start acting like it and work to get our money.",good conscienc recommend game current state realli enjoy game believ ca gone control still bug launch updat arent fix anyth updat dlc add new one thing simpl fix left unfix thing critic gameplay still issu fact priorit releas new dlc get amount content cost previou game refus fix underli issu game recommend anyon top utter disrespect commun get ca unforgiv ban statement none make us feel like valu pay custom activ tell compani unhappi need better yet get hostil implic grate longer purchas ca titl dlc manag recogn mistak walk back rhythm garner respect pay custom remov way support current mental compani game arent basic necess theyr luxuri better start act like work get money

"I STRONGLY recommend this game! They're adding a feature today to let new players join their friends, even if the server is full! I truly enjoy almost every aspect of this game. The open world that entice you to explore all areas, the unique design and art direction of monsters and environment, the base building. And the best thing about it all, no pay to win features. Furthermore they have both PVP and PVE servers, so there's something for each type of players. With a promise to add new content regularly, the game will stay interesting and relevant for a long time. In the near future, the game developers also promise to make seasons longer, and you won't lose most of your hard earned accomplishments like blueprints and so on. The developers really listens so the community and promptly address any issues that the community has.The game needs some work with the questing aspect, more specifically the dialogues.. most of the dialogue is unvoiced and is taking away from the immersion, surely this will be added in future updates. Playing on a PVE server, I also think the devs should consider adding more early game content that promotes Co-op gameplay, as it seems like there's not really a lot of content that makes you seek interactions between Meta-Humans. With almost 100 hours in the game, I still can still see myself playing this game a lot more, and I am looking forward to the future of Once Human!",strongli recommend game theyr ad featur today let new player join friend even server full truli enjoy almost everi aspect game open world entic explor area uniqu design art direct monster environ base build best thing pay win featur furthermor pvp pve server there someth type player promis add new content regularli game stay interest relev long time near futur game develop also promis make season longer wont lose hard earn accomplish like blueprint develop realli listen commun promptli address issu commun hasth game need work quest aspect specif dialogu dialogu unvoic take away immers sure ad futur updat play pve server also think dev consid ad earli game content promot coop gameplay seem like there realli lot content make seek interact metahuman almost hour game still still see play game lot look forward futur human

"2022 Not very good PC port. Do not buy the game at this moment. You create your character, watch the opening, then there's a black screen and the game crashes to desktop. And even If you don't crash every 10 minutes, the performance is really bad, even with everything on low. That was my experience and many others' it seems. It's kind of unplayable right now.With this many crashes and frame rate drops, a hotfix is inevitable. But wait until then. Cool character customization I guess. That's all I can say about the actual game because that's as far as I got.

"2023 Rapid Decline of a Former Beloved ""For the Players"" Developer - Demands Tithes From All Players Followed by Veiled Threats of Death of The GameEdit 11/21/23 I will admit that I had the smallest of hope that they might finally do the right things. But after seeing today's ""MASSIVE UPDATE!!"", Creative Assembly literally confirmed that they don't care what we say or ask for. All I have to say is, who asked for the stuff they put in today's update? No one did. Maybe the work on the siege battles, but they made it worse!! And they messed up big time on the Hero Training ability. Who asked for new main menu backgrounds? No one ever. This was their last opportunity to turn things around for me and so many other players. I've recently moved to an area where all ISPs have data caps on the home internet. So for games that are 100gb or larger, I will keep on my 2tb ssd so I can play them if I ever want. This was one of the games that I basically had installed permanently. Today, I will be uninstalling this game and that means I will never install it again, unless Creative Assembly actually puts some type of real effort into saving this game. Or if I move to a different area where there is no data cap. Then I'll just install it to play it once and then probably uninstall it shortly after. Creative Assembly is basically rubbing it in our faces that they do NOT care about this game. Shadows of Price Change is $5 off, making it $10 less than the base game currently is on sale..... what a joke. I wouldn't even buy it if it was $10.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review from 8/28/23For the sake of hoping this might make an impact that the company notices. I will be refusing to purchase any DLC from here on out unless they make a meaningful change to the price target they are going for with DLCs. Out of the 3 games, this one has given me the least enjoyment. Months, if not entire quarters go by without any new content (which is radically different from the first 2) and the entire first year of it's release seemed like a whole year went by with nothing, not even a word from them sometimes. The campaign was almost impossible to beat at launch with most factions until they finally corrected it and the fix for that took forever. Any meaningful changes made to the balances, will royally mess up any previous game saves you had if you were specializing in anything so you usually just start over (leading to numerous unfinished runs). I am a big warhammer fan and if it has warhammer or 40k's name on it, you're pretty much guaranteed to have me sucked in.I was salty when I saw the price of the chaos dwarves DLC, salty enough that i didn't pre-oder for the first time since the warhammer series started for total war. I waited until it was on sale and even then, I was still salty as I knew deep down that all I was really doing was pulling my pants down in preparation of their next DLC, shadows of price-change. Creative Assembly did not deviate from mine and numerous others' predictions, that they were preparing us so that they could tear us a new hole. Since said hole tearing, the only option CA has now officially given to us is to apologize to them and to then immediately beg them for more hole tearing. If we do not like that sole choice given to us, well they did mention ONE other option that they themselves are willing to go with. Which is to literally pick up the monopoly board and throw it across the room, all the while screaming about how it's all our faults that we didn't want to be extorted anymore. Ruining things for everyone, more specifically ruining things for their own employees' future job security by completely shutting down the game. I have been a big total war player since shogun 2 and own every one except for atilla, three kingdoms and throne of britannia. For all of the total war games that I do have, I have every single DLC for them. I could speak of how cheap they used to be back in the day, but lets focus on the recent entries that matter. The standard pricing was $8-12 for lords DLC and $15 for faction DLC. I remember holding off on the beastmen and the wood elf dlcs for warhammer 1, solely because of the price of $15. The only thing that got me to buy them in the end, was because they came with their own mini campaigns that whether they were good or not, they usually added a whole different play style for a faction, with other new elements and just plain new content. For warhammer 2, the tomb kings and vampire coast $15 DLCs each with their own new factions, that added new locations onto the then current map and the factions were good and fun enough that they still stay within the top 10-15 factions to play. That was what made it truly worth that price for that content.I remember when CA came out of no where and surprised us with the bretonnian FLC, or when they were coming out with heroes left and right that were lore connected. And now CA wants us to pay $25 for something that used to cost only like $8 in warhammer 1 & 2. And lets not forget about the number 1 thing that CA wants us to remember when we get butt hurt over their price hikes; that if we don't pay up, then they'll just shut the whole thing down. They'll cut any planned projects that don't require the minimalist of effort, they'll either fire or shift their employees around to different departments and/or localities, they'll make sure that any DLC that they will continue with, has the least amount of QA work done on and they'll do all that while doing their best to tell the world that it was all our fault for not paying an outrageous price.",rapid declin former belov player develop demand tith player follow veil threat death gameedit admit smallest hope might final right thing see today massiv updat creativ assembl liter confirm dont care say ask say ask stuff put today updat one mayb work sieg battl made wors mess big time hero train abil ask new main menu background one ever last opportun turn thing around mani player ive recent move area isp data cap home internet game larger keep ssd play ever want one game basic instal perman today uninstal game mean never instal unless creativ assembl actual put type real effort save game move differ area data cap ill instal play probabl uninstal shortli creativ assembl basic rub face care game shadow price chang make less base game current sale joke wouldnt even buy review sake hope might make impact compani notic refus purchas dlc unless make meaning chang price target go dlc game one given least enjoy month entir quarter go without new content radic differ first entir first year releas seem like whole year went noth even word sometim campaign almost imposs beat launch faction final correct fix took forev meaning chang made balanc royal mess previou game save special anyth usual start lead numer unfinish run big warhamm fan warhamm name your pretti much guarante suck ini salti saw price chao dwarv dlc salti enough didnt preoder first time sinc warhamm seri start total war wait sale even still salti knew deep realli pull pant prepar next dlc shadow pricechang creativ assembl deviat mine numer other predict prepar us could tear us new hole sinc said hole tear option ca offici given us apolog immedi beg hole tear like sole choic given us well mention one option will go liter pick monopoli board throw across room scream fault didnt want extort anymor ruin thing everyon specif ruin thing employe futur job secur complet shut game big total war player sinc shogun everi one except atilla three kingdom throne britannia total war game everi singl dlc could speak cheap use back day let focu recent entri matter standard price lord dlc faction dlc rememb hold beastmen wood elf dlc warhamm sole price thing got buy end came mini campaign whether good usual ad whole differ play style faction new element plain new content warhamm tomb king vampir coast dlc new faction ad new locat onto current map faction good fun enough still stay within top faction play made truli worth price contenti rememb ca came surpris us bretonnian flc come hero left right lore connect ca want us pay someth use cost like warhamm let forget number thing ca want us rememb get butt hurt price hike dont pay theyll shut whole thing theyll cut plan project dont requir minimalist effort theyll either fire shift employe around differ depart andor local theyll make sure dlc continu least amount qa work done theyll best tell world fault pay outrag price
"TL DR: 9.2/10W:If you hold any curiosity in Chinese culture, tale of gods, the concept of ""Wu Kong"" that got abused by countless good/bad games, you should try this game. This game depict the best of the spirit ""Wu Kong"" and leave you with a tangled story for you to uncover, a good discussion of what is ""Wu Kong"".The next discussion should go to art, the art is amazing, probably the best Chinese companies have ever yield. The game play is also very fun, there are a large variety of different combination of spells to use, refund skill points are completely free. I had a great fun of thinking about builds for different bosses. This game's most similar comparison is God of War, it does a better job in a lot of aspects. you are constantly fighting mini-bosses and bosses with very little reuse of models. Character developments are amazing EXCEPT what I would discuss in the Ls.The story books tied to all normal mobs and bosses are fantastic too.English translation did a very good job, it conveys the majority of the idea of the hardest content to translate-- traditional Chinese.*** Next part contains a lot of spoilers***L:As the chosen one the you play the role of, ""you"" have limited character development, the game depict very little of your emotion, reaction to some most shocking, heart breaking, breathe taking events. other than collecting ***THE THINGS***(avoid spoiling here), you feel more like a vessel, even the real vessel feels more vivid (If you get to that fight, you will know what I mean).Quality of chapter 5 and 6 are questionable. Don't take me wrong, chapter 1 is a good starting, chapter 2, 3, 4 are amazing steady incrementing of difficulty and map puzzles, but chapter 5 feels short where you can't get to a lot of places where I think I should be able to go to and chapter 6 feels a rush to end.Camera on some bosses are aids, like really bad and annoying, some thin-leg bosses make that even worse.the hit-box on some boss registering feels not good.",tl dr hold curios chines cultur tale god concept wu kong got abus countless goodbad game tri game game depict best spirit wu kong leav tangl stori uncov good discuss wu kongth next discuss go art art amaz probabl best chines compani ever yield game play also fun larg varieti differ combin spell use refund skill point complet free great fun think build differ boss game similar comparison god war better job lot aspect constantli fight miniboss boss littl reus model charact develop amaz except would discuss lsthe stori book tie normal mob boss fantast tooenglish translat good job convey major idea hardest content translat tradit chines next part contain lot spoilersla chosen one play role limit charact develop game depict littl emot reaction shock heart break breath take event collect thingsavoid spoil feel like vessel even real vessel feel vivid get fight know meanqual chapter question dont take wrong chapter good start chapter amaz steadi increment difficulti map puzzl chapter feel short cant get lot place think abl go chapter feel rush endcamera boss aid like realli bad annoy thinleg boss make even worseth hitbox boss regist feel good

"Game was fun for the short amount of time I played. Unfortunately, the server situation is a mess. Basically, once a server is full, no one new can join. This means that I can't join the server that my buddy is playing on, and without that, there is no point in playing for me at the moment. Maybe I'll give it another go once they've sorted out it out (but reality is probably not).

"After finishing the story this game is definitely my GOTY for 2024.Despite the story being on the shorter side it was peak all the way through. The writing is very good and the cutscenes are some of the best I've seen. Plus there is more to do outside the story with PvE missions and the PvP.The overall gameplay in this game is very fun and engaging. The parry system is very satisfying and just fighting the hordes of enemies overall is very fun. I feel all of my hits having impact on the enemies which just makes it very pleasing combat wise.

"2022 Elden Ring feels like the culmination of everything FromSoftware has learned from the SoulsBorne games and Sekiro. The world is vast and intricate. The characters are intriguing. The music is awesome. The voice acting is convincing. And the gameplay is satisfying. My only issue is that there are occasional frame rate stutters. The game has crashed very infrequently for me. I feel confident that these issues will be resolved. They've been very minor inconveniences for me, though I know others are having much more significant issues.",elden ring feel like culmin everyth fromsoftwar learn soulsborn game sekiro world vast intric charact intrigu music awesom voic act convinc gameplay satisfi issu occasion frame rate stutter game crash infrequ feel confid issu resolv theyv minor inconveni though know other much signific issu
"Warhammer 40k: Space Marines 2 Release Date: 05/09/2024 (PRE-RELEASE) Overview In ""Space Marine 2,"" players once again take on the role of Captain Titus as he battles against the relentless forces of Chaos and the Tyranids, a swarm-like alien race. The game promises intense, visceral combat that combines brutal melee attacks with devastating ranged weaponry, staying true to the original's blend of action and strategy. The game is set to deliver improved visuals, more dynamic environments, and larger battles, taking full advantage of current-gen hardware. It also aims to capture the dark and oppressive atmosphere of the Warhammer 40k universe, appealing to both longtime fans and newcomers. Story Players continue the saga of Captain Titus, a seasoned Ultramarine who is thrust into a desperate battle against the relentless Tyranids, an alien species known for their hive mind and insatiable hunger. As the Imperium of Man faces overwhelming odds, Captain Titus must lead his squad through war-torn environments, using a mix of brutal melee and powerful ranged combat to defend humanity from annihilation. The story explores themes of duty, sacrifice, and the eternal struggle against the dark forces threatening the galaxy. Pros The Story is breath taking, it will make you fully immersed. Character Dialogue is very good – Through out the campaign, you will be your team mates converse conversation / arguments Campaign is an average of 12 hours long on normal difficulty The game is set to challenge you, even on normal difficulty. For me that is a “Pro” The Settings between main hub (Ship) to Planets where the war takes place is unique on every mission. Lots of weapon choices for you to use, some weapons are better than others based the enemies you are fighting against. AI team mates (If playing alone) if you die they will focus to revive you Cons “Saving Checkpoints” don’t really exist when you go back to main menu or quit the game. The missions are a good hour or two long. If you quit halfway through or towards the end. You will have to start that mission all over again. You can’t customise the way you look throughout the campaign (Minor) AI Team mates are a bit dumb, they don’t really fight off bosses and mainly leave it down to you. Executions they will leave for you to do instead of them. Sometimes and I mean sometimes (uncommon) they will do the executions for you. Gameplay The gameplay in ""Space Marine 2"" centers on fast-paced, brutal combat as players control Captain Titus, blending heavy melee attacks with powerful ranged weapons. It emphasizes the visceral experience of being a Space Marine, allowing players to chain attacks, execute combos, and use tactics to battle the Tyranid hordes. Designed to capture the intensity and scale of Warhammer 40,000, the game offers a mix of strategy, skill, and raw power. Pros Weapons from Hand Guns, Rifles, Snipers and Melee weapons feel great! Melee Weapons are a strong point in the game to take down your foes making you feel powerful against your enemies. From Knife, Chainsaw, Hammer and Sword. Each feeling different but impacting Hand Guns are great to pick off smaller targets but also allowing you to take out “Snipers” in the background that is bothering you and your team. Rifles feel great, Semi-Automatic weapons that allows you to take out swarm of enemies Plasma weapons are strong against larger enemies compared to swarms. Which allows you to pick your weapons for the right fight. I like how the gameplay changes throughout PvE Operations & Throughout the campaign. You can pick your weapons wisely. Cons Minor Bug – Larger Enemies uses a charge attack which then YEETS you into the air (Its Funny) but not a major deal breaker. This is very rare but can happen. Cut-scene, loading screen to Cut-scene and loading screen. It gets annoying on PvE Operations BUT! It does allow players to skip cut-scenes IF all players vote to skip. If you are playing with randoms… You might be watching the same cutscene repeatedly. Server Disconnects – Yes, they use Epic Game Servers, From experience of being an admin maintaining servers on Squad. It is TERRIBLE. Had a lot of server disconnects on the Pre-release but hopefully this will improve overtime. Graphics ""Space Marine 2,"" built on the Swarm Engine, features highly detailed graphics that capture the grimdark Warhammer 40,000 universe. The game includes richly textured environments and meticulously crafted character models, with impressive lighting and visual effects that enhance the dark, immersive experience. Pros Art is AMAZING – They spent a lot of time to every attention to details Customization to your character is amazing, you can edit each armour and colour. You can make yourself look more unique compared to others. Visualization is absolutely stunning. Blood, Gore, Shadows, Environment, War-torn, Lighting, etc. Is a 10 out of 10. For a Pre-release the game is playable, haven’t experienced any Graphical bugs. Cons If you are running low to mid-tier computer like me, its not end of the world. I get average of 50 to 60fps on medium graphics with some shadows / effects of low (GTX 1080). Information from friends who have mid-high end PC’s they get an average of 60FPS on 2K monitor on High Settings (RTX 3080) Replayability Is expected to offer decent replayability through its intense combat mechanics and the potential for multiple difficulty levels, encouraging players to refine their skills and tactics. While the core narrative may be linear, the satisfaction of mastering combat, experimenting with different weapons, and facing various enemy types could motivate multiple playthroughs. Additionally, if the game includes any form of multiplayer, co-op modes, or post-launch content, these would significantly enhance its replayability. However, the extent of replayability will ultimately depend on the variety of content and any additional features beyond the main campaign. Pros Campaign is 12 hours long to complete on Normal Difficulty. PvE Operations (CO-OP) Mode has 6 missions on Pre-Release. There will be more to come according to Road Map the developer’s has released. PvP is Fun, It allows you to unlock more cosmetics for your character which can be used on PvE Operations. PvE Operations allows your to upgrade your weapons mastery and perks. Which allows your to re-play missions on a higher difficulty (Like DarkTide and Vermintide) There are 6 Classes playable for PvE Mode – Assault, Vanguard, Bulwark, Tactical, Heavy and Sniper Cons Levelling each character & Weapons can be very grindy / time consuming Final Verdict Summarise my overall impressions of the game. I absolutely loved the campaign! This game does need day 1 patch to fix some bugs with Match-Making cross platform.

"2022 WOW, a game that actually lives up to the hype? It's insane how this hits every nail on the head perfectly. You know it's bad when you expect all triple A games to just be steaming piles of trash that you are shocked when a game works perfectly right away and has actual attention to detail in it. What's that? The water actually moves when you walk and role in it? Not only that but it cleans the blood off your character and weapons and adds a damp look to your character? This game is oozing with detail and works right out of the box. It's crazy and it was well worth the wait. Thank you.Actual review. It's like if Skyrim, Breath of the Wild, and all the Souls/Borne games had a massive orgy and made this masterpiece. There are times the game doesn't even feel like a Souls game anymore and that's a GOOD THING. Just to be lost in it and see it as it's own game rather than decending from something else is amazing. Of course you can't look past the animations and enemies being ripped right from the previous FromSoftware works but honestly, it all works. Just exploring and getting lost in the world and walking around, seeing all the amazing things put into this game is such a treat and with how games have been releasing lately, this should be a technical impossibility yet they did it, they really did it and made something amazing. Souls play-throughs usually take around 16 hours to beat. I'm 16 hours in (currently) and I haven't been following the main path at all. I literally went the complete opposite direction and it actually let me and I didn't get punished for it. Exploration is key and this game does an outstanding job at doing it.Game is so good, it's actually getting people who don't like Souls but love other games like BotW and Skyrim into it. You know they're doing something right when they can break out of their mold and attract other fan-bases like that.",wow game actual live hype insan hit everi nail head perfectli know bad expect tripl game steam pile trash shock game work perfectli right away actual attent detail what water actual move walk role clean blood charact weapon add damp look charact game ooz detail work right box crazi well worth wait thank youactual review like skyrim breath wild soulsborn game massiv orgi made masterpiec time game doesnt even feel like soul game anymor that good thing lost see game rather decend someth els amaz cours cant look past anim enemi rip right previou fromsoftwar work honestli work explor get lost world walk around see amaz thing put game treat game releas late technic imposs yet realli made someth amaz soul playthrough usual take around hour beat im hour current havent follow main path liter went complet opposit direct actual let didnt get punish explor key game outstand job itgam good actual get peopl dont like soul love game like botw skyrim know theyr someth right break mold attract fanbas like

"2022 There are huge caveats with a recommendation of this game.The gameplay when everything comes together is incredible. The feeling of clutching a round for your team, especially when you're with friends, is beaten only by the elation of winning a close-fought match through sheer doggedness and team spirit. Frankly, in those kinds of matches even losing 16-14 can leave you with a smile on your face.However, I don't know how I would get into this game as a beginner nowadays. Though if I didn't know better I'd probably try the free-to-play version, I recommend at least paying for a Prime-enabled account. The problem with cheaters is very large and could lead to a quick disillusionment with the game. Some veterans even leave the game because of this problem. It's such a terrible sinking feeling when you arrive in a match and see an enemy, or even a teammate, spinbotting or obviously hacking. You just know you've wasted the next 15 minutes or, if they only start hacking after they get angry and falsely believe you're hacking, you've wasted even longer. Either that or you can leave, but you will get a cooldown from matchmaking servers for abandoning a match! If you are intent on learning it competitively, I'd suggest researching third-party services like faceit (available for anyone as far as I know) or ECL (I believe currently only hosting servers located in Europe). ECL actively moderates its users and seems to have a fairly welcoming community, perhaps it would be relatively easy to find people of a similar skill level willing to help out a beginner. Unfortunately I think the base experience in Valve's own matchmaking system can be horrible and beginners might have a decent experience, or a completely off-putting one with toxic teammates who can't remember what it was like to be new in the game.Prepare for the worst. I hope you get to enjoy the best of what CS has to offer.",huge caveat recommend gameth gameplay everyth come togeth incred feel clutch round team especi your friend beaten elat win closefought match sheer dogged team spirit frankli kind match even lose leav smile facehowev dont know would get game beginn nowaday though didnt know better id probabl tri freetoplay version recommend least pay primeen account problem cheater larg could lead quick disillusion game veteran even leav game problem terribl sink feel arriv match see enemi even teammat spinbot obvious hack know youv wast next minut start hack get angri fals believ your hack youv wast even longer either leav get cooldown matchmak server abandon match intent learn competit id suggest research thirdparti servic like faceit avail anyon far know ecl believ current host server locat europ ecl activ moder user seem fairli welcom commun perhap would rel easi find peopl similar skill level will help beginn unfortun think base experi valv matchmak system horribl beginn might decent experi complet offput one toxic teammat cant rememb like new gameprepar worst hope get enjoy best cs offer

"2023 The siege battles are *somehow* less fun than before. The AI can't even keep archers on the wall to shoot at you as you attack. The big campaign is cool but just adding more races to a bigger and bigger campaign map doesn't make things more fun it's basically the same experience. If the campaign AI can't make reasonable decisions even with huge economic advantages what will adding more races and making the map bigger really do at the end of the day?I guess the multiplayer changes are really cool for this game, yet to try them but on paper it's pretty rad. Other than that, as someone who played the crap out of TWWH2, I don't see many improvements other than bigger. I had a lot more fun playing 2 for some reason. I keep coming back and getting 8 or so hours into a campaign to chase that dragon but the magic is gone.

"Definitely DO NOT recommend this.I've grown up on a large variety of games, and this game suffers from bad pacing and design.You need a 4080 to play because I've found the input lag unbearable. From technical reviews like Digital Foundry, you *must* turn off frame generation and other settings (global illum, shadows, anti-aliasing, etc) because these cause significant input delay. Why buy a game costing $94 only to kill visual settings?? Its optimization is shockingly bad when other visually stunning games run well. Warframe, Doom Eternal, Elden Ring, etc are all examples of fast-paced gorgeous games at over 200fps on older systems. Act 1 unfortunately runs past 2 hours so by the time these issues become apparent, I can't get a refund.Key problems:1) Buggy input queues for spirits, transformation, and medicines. Sometimes I must keep tapping the button to trigger usage. Sometimes a light tap interrupts my attack combo instead of queuing up. Sometimes nothing happens after spamming repeatedly and I'm standing around while the boss is waiting in the background weirdly.2) Dodge mechanic very inconsistent. e.g. I've managed to dodge bosses OHKO attack, but after repeated experiments, it's inconsistent. The perfect dodge mechanic also doesn't trigger consistently. It feels like you inconsistently have a larger hitbox.3) Horrifically bad camera angles. Most games have an ""greasy camera slide"" algorithm to detect obstructions between the player and camera origin. It auto-moves the camera. In this game, I got stuck behind a pillar or tree or bush until I'm dead. Also, they did not notice to zoom out on the camera for mega-boss stages, so you're often looking between Wukong's legs or the earth.4) Inconsistent stage design. In act 1, the game has shrines right before main bosses. Later on, you must run back across entire stages to get back to a boss. If you die many times... Good luck.5) Toxic community. Astroturfing by China fanboys makes it impossible to get help or raise attention to the devs for fixes. No dissent is allowed. Everything else is downvoted or harrassed. You can't even make recommendations on tuning graphic settings. Even asking to tune down the difficulty traps you into needless arguments about how to get good. It's amazing how rude they are to older adults with jobs and kids, but still want to enjoy the story.Devs have not communicated on improving the game. Best to wait for actual substantial updates before making a purchase.-----------------28 Aug 2024Made it into act 4. Act 3 is easily 3 times larger than act 1 and 2, which is extremely tedious. Invisible walls everywhere. Many corners look like they can be explored, but are dead ends with no visual design to prevent us from wasting time. You can't interact with the environment unlike Genshin Impact. There's no flying. No wall climbing. Even warframe, a FREE game, I can bullet jump and wall latch. The movement here makes the monkey king look lame.Boss fights in act 3 were also lame. You dance between the boss legs, so your camera is always twitching between his legs and floor. The company calls itself Game Science, claiming to be a serious science and engineering studio... But learned no lessons by GOTY games over the past decade for such things.After unlocking most skills, the game play is also... boring. A few enemies have long attack chains, yet you must keep dodging because upgraded attacks cannot disrupt them. Thus, Dodge Fest Simulator.So you'll cheese it by charging up thrust stance right? That's even more boring. You can't spam magic as magic does NOT recharge until you get special gourd much later. So you have to save your spells and transformation by cheesing through the entire stageORbe forced tododgedodgedodgedodgebecause enemies cannot be interrupted without charged heavy attacks. So keep dodging until your focal points are enough to heavy attack. Then repeat dodging.Finally, the story?It's as if the devs have never studied their own culture or history. The reasons that I love Journey to the West, even studied asian religions and philosophies in university, was because of the deeply respectful and profound allegorical discourses absent from other civilisations. From a story writing perspective, this is important. 3000+ years of profound and rich source material exists for story writers.There's an abundance to create a beautiful cast of characters, each with deep complex portrayals that could have made the story profoundly moving. But none of that was seen.""Journey to the West"" was written at a time (circa 1592) when Buddhism had thrived in a huge sprawling dynastic empire (circa Tang Dynasty 618-907). Before Buddhism came (circa BCE 206), Shamanism, rich regional folk lore, Taoism (circa BCE 450), Confucius (circa BCE 551, Hundred Schools of Thought era), and all manner of secular sects were already deeply rooted. ""Journey to the West"" is a rare culmination of allegorical novel writing popular over centuries. Yet, none of this was used in game.Instead, the characters are shallow and lacking depth. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are liars neglecting vows. Celestial court is full of superficial violent immortals. Humans are weak animals at their mercy. Demons are always evil because it is their birth nature. The profound essence of China's culture no longer exists in the game. Like China cities today, all that exists in the game is a beautiful facade. What is China culture?In the original novel, countless profound moments exist. The one I love is about the length of their journey in chapter 24:""你自小时走到老，老了再小，老小千番也还难。只要你见性志诚，念念回首处，即是灵山。""""You can walk from young till old, from old till young again, and even for 1000 cycles, it would still be difficult (to reach the end of your journey). But once you truly achieve the resolute perception (of wisdom), (realising that) Buddha-nature (exists) in all things, then you will have immediately arrived at Spirit Mountain (at the end of your journey).""There are countless lines of beautiful prose and poetry peppered across the original novel.Moments when loyalty and brotherhood stand in contrast to easy victories and unscrupulous tactics. Moments when you realise, for all of Wukong's fiery temper and violence, he is a person that deeply cares about doing the right thing with a deep penetrating wisdom that cuts through the commonly accepted social beliefs. Disappointingly, all of that. Gone. Lost.All we have left is a beautiful spectacle mired by aggressive toxic fanboys and a superficial court (studio)?Maybe this is the ultimate allegory; spiritual successor in the lamentation of modern China. 表面美化，盖掉缺点，心中百烂。Maybe that is the true intent of the game developers.",definit recommend thisiv grown larg varieti game game suffer bad pace designy need play ive found input lag unbear technic review like digit foundri must turn frame gener set global illum shadow antialias etc caus signific input delay buy game cost kill visual set optim shockingli bad visual stun game run well warfram doom etern elden ring etc exampl fastpac gorgeou game older system act unfortun run past hour time issu becom appar cant get refundkey buggi input queue spirit transform medicin sometim must keep tap button trigger usag sometim light tap interrupt attack combo instead queu sometim noth happen spam repeatedli im stand around boss wait background dodg mechan inconsist eg ive manag dodg boss ohko attack repeat experi inconsist perfect dodg mechan also doesnt trigger consist feel like inconsist larger horrif bad camera angl game greasi camera slide algorithm detect obstruct player camera origin automov camera game got stuck behind pillar tree bush im dead also notic zoom camera megaboss stage your often look wukong leg inconsist stage design act game shrine right main boss later must run back across entir stage get back boss die mani time good toxic commun astroturf china fanboy make imposs get help rais attent dev fix dissent allow everyth els downvot harrass cant even make recommend tune graphic set even ask tune difficulti trap needless argument get good amaz rude older adult job kid still want enjoy storydev commun improv game best wait actual substanti updat make aug act act easili time larger act extrem tediou invis wall everywher mani corner look like explor dead end visual design prevent us wast time cant interact environ unlik genshin impact there fli wall climb even warfram free game bullet jump wall latch movement make monkey king look lameboss fight act also lame danc boss leg camera alway twitch leg floor compani call game scienc claim seriou scienc engin studio learn lesson goti game past decad thingsaft unlock skill game play also bore enemi long attack chain yet must keep dodg upgrad attack disrupt thu dodg fest simulatorso youll chees charg thrust stanc right that even bore cant spam magic magic recharg get special gourd much later save spell transform chees entir stageorb forc tododgedodgedodgedodgebecaus enemi interrupt without charg heavi attack keep dodg focal point enough heavi attack repeat dodgingfin storyit dev never studi cultur histori reason love journey west even studi asian religion philosophi univers deepli respect profound allegor discours absent civilis stori write perspect import year profound rich sourc materi exist stori writersther abund creat beauti cast charact deep complex portray could made stori profoundli move none seenjourney west written time circa buddhism thrive huge sprawl dynast empir circa tang dynasti buddhism came circa bce shaman rich region folk lore taoism circa bce confuciu circa bce hundr school thought era manner secular sect alreadi deepli root journey west rare culmin allegor novel write popular centuri yet none use gameinstead charact shallow lack depth buddha bodhisattva liar neglect vow celesti court full superfici violent immort human weak anim merci demon alway evil birth natur profound essenc china cultur longer exist game like china citi today exist game beauti facad china culturein origin novel countless profound moment exist one love length journey chapter walk young till old old till young even cycl would still difficult reach end journey truli achiev resolut percept wisdom realis buddhanatur exist thing immedi arriv spirit mountain end journeyther countless line beauti prose poetri pepper across origin novelmo loyalti brotherhood stand contrast easi victori unscrupul tactic moment realis wukong fieri temper violenc person deepli care right thing deep penetr wisdom cut commonli accept social belief disappointingli gone lostal left beauti spectacl mire aggress toxic fanboy superfici court studiomayb ultim allegori spiritu successor lament modern china mayb true intent game develop

2022 UPDATE: While I am leaving my original review below because it's still relevant my review remains a hard no unless on sale. Marked up DLCs that add less and less just add to the original pain of this title and it's clear the devs at this point are just giving everyone the middle finger.If I could leave a 'neutral' review I would but since I can't it's a thumbs down from me.The campaign was fun the first time albeit a spit in the face to WH lore in general which has just been made up for the sake of the campaign. That's that part that really irks me most.Paying $90AU for a handful of factions and nil replayability though was what added salt to the wound. They talked this guy up so much and produced something which was woeful in content. I'd expect what I got from an indie dev paying $30-$40 for this but from CA at full price? It's a con job for sure.As of writing this review wait for a 50% off before purchasing if you're keen.

"An excellent third-person shooter that immerses players in the Warhammer 40k universe.I'd say the game is a bit pricey for its current content, but a roadmap has already been released with content through to the end of 2025.The single-player campaign, is the sequel to the first opus and can be played solo or in co-op for up to 3 players. It's really good, but rather short (I'd say 8 hours of play). Then there's a less scripted co-op campaign where you can customize your space marine and play different classes. It's fairly short, but is designed to be played several times to improve your characters. There is also the 6vs6 PvP mode, which is really cool. Progression is pretty good, and you want to keep playing to unlock the next weapons and cosmetics, but unfortunately there are only 3 maps and 3 game modes at the moment.In conclusion, I'd recommend it to all fans of the 40k universe or anyone looking for a good shooter, but I'd advise you to buy it at a reduced price or wait for the developers to add a little more content.",excel thirdperson shooter immers player warhamm universeid say game bit pricey current content roadmap alreadi releas content end singleplay campaign sequel first opu play solo coop player realli good rather short id say hour play there less script coop campaign custom space marin play differ class fairli short design play sever time improv charact also pvp mode realli cool progress pretti good want keep play unlock next weapon cosmet unfortun map game mode momentin conclus id recommend fan univers anyon look good shooter id advis buy reduc price wait develop add littl content

"The style of the game is on point with satisfying gameplay, but it has some GLARING issues. I'd recommend it, but I hope it gets some polish soon!Pros:Style: The feel of the 40k universe is really hit on the head. This alone has probably gotten me through the game. I just really adore it.Audio: Crunchy sound design is very satisfying.Weapons: The gear you use feels pretty good, the design is limited, but it's loyal to the universe.Gameplay: Fairly rhythmic fighting with parries, counters & dodges.Big enemies: Boss fights can be tough ( Angel of Death difficulty ), but typically manageable ( caveat below ).Story: The story is a bit shallow, but good enough.Cons:The most glaring issue is ally AI. It's horrendous, pathetically bad. This can make some boss fights an absolute slog when you're trying to balance yourself to proceed through the fight. It also destroys immersion seeing an Astartes knuckle f***ing himself in the corner while you're fighting for your life.Hit boxes: The hit boxes are bad. You'll get hit at bizarre ranges & you'll often shoot invisible walls when attacking enemies. I've also been struck countless times through cover from ranged attacks.Homing Melee Attacks: One the most annoying things in this game is enemies leaping at you ( not talking about parry counters ) & having them turn in the air or have them YA YEET themselves after you when you dodge.Stun Lock: Though I understand it's a swarm hitting you & that's sort of the point, getting stun locked is just a poor choice. No one likes stun lock. No one likes losing control of their character. No one wants to have 2/3 of their health gone from 3 gaunts.",style game point satisfi gameplay glare issu id recommend hope get polish soonprosstyl feel univers realli hit head alon probabl gotten game realli ador itaudio crunchi sound design satisfyingweapon gear use feel pretti good design limit loyal universegameplay fairli rhythmic fight parri counter dodgesbig enemi boss fight tough angel death difficulti typic manag caveat stori stori bit shallow good enoughconsth glare issu alli ai horrend pathet bad make boss fight absolut slog your tri balanc proceed fight also destroy immers see astart knuckl fing corner your fight lifehit box hit box bad youll get hit bizarr rang youll often shoot invis wall attack enemi ive also struck countless time cover rang attackshom mele attack one annoy thing game enemi leap talk parri counter turn air ya yeet dodgestun lock though understand swarm hit that sort point get stun lock poor choic one like stun lock one like lose control charact one want health gone gaunt

"2022 A Dark Fantasy for the Ages...» Elden Ring is an absolute masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling. It is vastly different from other open-world games I have experienced such as The Witcher 3 and Skyrim, which are story and questline driven. From the get-go, Elden Ring does not impose any particular playstyle or route on you. You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game. You can finish the main storyline and beat the final boss, or you can explore the entire map without ever seeing the main bosses. It truly is up to you with no outside influence. This sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open-world game is refreshing.Not to mention, Elden Ring has also mastered the art of subtlety. For example, for a game like Skyrim, there are various elements such as the character dialogues, leveling system, and various landmarks that I could clearly point to in contributing to the game's success. However, this is not the case here. It is hard to place a finger on one specific thing that makes Elden Ring so enjoyable. Many times I have gone in to play this game for half an hour, only to become immersed, losing track of time and playing for hours on end. I believe that the game's features, i.e. the combat system, transportation, landscape, lore, storytelling, etc., complement each other in a way that none of them are overbearing. At the same time, these elements come together in such a fluid manner that I, as the player, cannot notice it and am drawn into a level of immersion that I have not felt from any game before.Environment» This game has one of the most enormous and intricately detailed worlds I have ever seen in gaming. I have not had a single moment where the map felt desolate or empty; there was always something to see and explore. The castles, cities, and fortresses that you must traverse in this game are truly awe-inspiring. They are all massive, unique, and filled with a plethora of secret areas just waiting to be uncovered. The landscapes of the world are also astonishing. The sheer variety and scale of the environments are a sight to behold. Players can expect to explore vast mountains, forests, fields, deep caves, ancient ruins, and even hidden underground civilizations. It is clear that a great amount of work went into the design of all of these areas, as they are all exceptionally detailed and have complex lore, realism, and beauty to them that makes them a joy to explore.Combat» The combat in this game is utterly masterful, blending elements from many of FromSoftware's previous works including Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro to create an extremely tense, fluid, and customizable combat system. The amount of variety in terms of different playstyles, build variation, and weapon types are enough to make the combat in this game endlessly enjoyable.You also have more freedom in how you approach combat than any previous souls game thanks to a bunch of familiar new systems that are used in interesting ways here. Stealth is a more viable option thanks to the addition of crouch-walking, which finally lets you sneak by tough enemies or get behind them for a critical hit; there’s now horseback combat in large, open areas which gives you more mobility and the ability to attack on both sides with your right-handed weapon, but has the drawback of taking away your ability to roll out of the way of big attacks; you can craft items on the fly using materials found in the world so you can be ready for whatever a situation calls for; you can summon a large variety of creatures to fight for you, each with their own unique abilities and situational advantages; and most substantially, you can equip Ashes of War to your weapons and completely change their affinity and skill.The Ashes of War system essentially combines two elements of prior Souls games – weapon affinities and weapon skills – by making them items that you can freely equip to your armaments. For example, let’s say you find a really good rapier and like the moveset, but are building your character with a focus on the Intelligence stat, which means it won’t get the kind of damage bonuses it needs to be a viable weapon. If you find an Art of War that bestows a magic spell onto a weapon, you can equip it and transform it into a magic weapon, thereby giving it Intelligence scaling on top of whatever skill the Ash of War has. Best of all, if you eventually decide to re-spec into a different build, you can still keep the same weapon and just put a different Ash of War onto it. Of course, you also have to find a specific item to unlock the different affinities, but it's nonetheless an incredibly smart addition that allows for a ton of variety in your preferred weapons.Bosses» The boss roster of Elden Ring is also extremely difficult and unforgettable. Most of the boss battles are remarkably challenging, rich with lore, and breathtaking. The complex fighting style of the bosses cannot be overlooked. Many of the bosses have extremely intricate, fast, and punishing attacks that are both tough to avoid and fun to fight against. This makes the battles against the bosses feel like a dance, as you rhythmically dodge their devastating combo attacks before finding small windows to go on the offensive. This is nothing new, as this style of boss encounter is exactly what the Dark Souls series pioneered. However, Elden Ring perfects this age-old formula by giving the bosses bigger movesets, greater speed, and more complex combos than ever before. Some of the bosses can hammer you with 10-hit long combos with little margin for error, and the player must master a boss' moveset if they ever hope to come out on top. When you combine this with the grotesquely stunning visual design, you get some of the tensest and most engaging boss battles in history.On top of all this, the epic scope of the boss encounters and vast areas is further heightened by Elden Ring's stellar musical score. It perfectly conveys the emotional connection that you should have with whichever boss you are fighting. Many of the soundtracks in this game are utterly blood-pumping in a way that few other video games can match.Conclusion» Overall, in my opinion, Elden Ring more than lives up to the enormous hype surrounding it, proving to be one of the most memorable, challenging, and complex gaming experiences of the last century.Score: 9.8/10Was this review helpful?» If so, please leave a rating.

"2017 Absolutely not recommendable because of the insane ammount of hackers.Today i dropped From Global Elite to supreme and lost 3 games on SMFC against Rage Hacking kids. In one game we were 8:4 ahead and 1 opponent left, joined back 3 rounds later jsut to announce he quickly downloaded a hack. So after he ragecarried the remaining rounds getting 11 MVPs we obviously lost. Don't get me wrong there are some strong players in this game who hit insane shots but with my almost 6 k hours of Counterstrike experience i can tell you that at least 5/7 matches have one hacker +, not even counting the insane amount of players using some kind of radar hack. In fact Valve doesn't even care. Do they try getting rid of the Hacker Problem? No, not really. Instead they keep adding skins and cases you have to pay for. Overwatch function seemed nice in the early state, but watching an overwatch session, you can't hear the ingame voice chat, which pretty much makes it useless. How do you want to hear if some1 keeps playing music ingame, uses a microphone of 1937 or keeps flaming? Or a hacker calling ingame? No, all you can see is a Scoreboard and the PoV of the Suspect, of course you are not able to switch the teammates. Counterstrike Anti-Cheat is so damn useless, a friend with 1 year programming experience was able to build a hack, which was undetected for over 2 years.Another problem ist the community. Most players below LEM are queueing with 2+ mates only speaking their own explicit language. So why the hell is there no ""Team-Language"" Option ingame to fix these kind of things?All in all CS-GO is a nice skill-based shooter with high potential, being ruined by a company only interested in milking the cow and a highly toxic community. To enjoy this game you would actually need to buy ESEA or just not play any kind of competative matches, which would make cs go kind of senseless.Cheers",absolut recommend insan ammount hackerstoday drop global elit suprem lost game smfc rage hack kid one game ahead oppon left join back round later jsut announc quickli download hack ragecarri remain round get mvp obvious lost dont get wrong strong player game hit insan shot almost k hour counterstrik experi tell least match one hacker even count insan amount player use kind radar hack fact valv doesnt even care tri get rid hacker problem realli instead keep ad skin case pay overwatch function seem nice earli state watch overwatch session cant hear ingam voic chat pretti much make useless want hear keep play music ingam use microphon keep flame hacker call ingam see scoreboard pov suspect cours abl switch teammat counterstrik anticheat damn useless friend year program experi abl build hack undetect yearsanoth problem ist commun player lem queue mate speak explicit languag hell teamlanguag option ingam fix kind thingsal csgo nice skillbas shooter high potenti ruin compani interest milk cow highli toxic commun enjoy game would actual need buy esea play kind compet match would make cs go kind senselessch

"2023 I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me. YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best) Views: 4,722 So I finally got around to making this video cause heaps of people have been requesting it. It took a lot of guts to even talk in front of the camera as I'm so conscious about my speech problem. and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.

"2022 Imagine if they took Markus Wulfhart's campaign from TW2 and made it the entire game for TW3. CA took one of the worst design elements, random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spawning in your territory, and cranked it up to 11.Problems?Minor settlement battles are a grindUnit balance is off by a considerable marginDemon unit roster feels lacklusterKislev is ""recommended start campaign"" but is cancer.More cases of a mediocre item (Katarin's Ice Cloak) having one of the most cancerous quest battles, while awesome items are given for free or little effortThe debuffs from chaos corruption is BS. -300 growth, -20 public order, and more at 90+ corruptionThe demon portal stuff can eat away so many turns for your army you send in. Worsen that by pissing away more time after they get out to sit in a major settlement to get rid of the corruption. 50% chance so will it be 3 turns? 10? Pray to RNGesusYou are so pigeon-holed into playing the campaign the way they want that they somehow made the game feel linear to play. The playing ""tall"" incentive also plays into that problem.I was hoping Legendary Lords would have more uniqueness to them. It's still just okay. The regular lords still have obvious worst and best (like Cathay's dragon lords vs their normie lords).Autoresolve is as punishing as ever, if not worse.Certain spells are just garbage. Like the ice magic having an overpriced version of Spirit Leech which was already overpriced.I don't understand how CA was working towards such a great game with TW2 and then just nose dived this one. It feels like so many of the problems from before just persist in this and while there are improvements, it's just too many issues to be having a good time. This game is not worth $60. It was one of those situations where I was like ""Oh how can they screw up TW3. They just have to take TW2 and improve on it."" but then they goofed up.The potential is there, but it's getting a big thumbs down from me until they make some serious changes.Update:So they have made a lot of big changes. The big thing is that Immortal Empires is out and most of the good stuff is associated with that. The main campaign has also been improved. Settlement battles are still bad, but they're not nearly as frequent. Overall, I'd still give it a thumb down until more improvements are done.

"Pros: - Fantastic visuals that capture the 40k aesthetics- Good variety in playstyles among the classes- Good visual customization by individual armour parts- Satisfying gunplay and melee, visceral finishers- Large arsenal of weapons, each with minor variations along their own progression paths- Tyranids are extremely well realized. They nailed the scope of the swarms. The Gargoyle swarms absolutely managed to convey the scope of a tyranid invasion. While it should be even worse than this, it’s a perfectly fine approximation given limited computing power. Tyranid dynamics were translated nicely into gameplay. Take out the warrior, so the gaunts collapse, take out the Hive Tyrant to bring an entire assault to a screeching halt. All the special bioforms feel distinctive and accurate, with the Lictor being my favourite. The fact that auspex scan reveals him, that the initial boss encounter is basically Predator and the sound cues whenever a lictor is lurking make it a great experience.Cons:- Characters are cardboard cut-outs you cannot customize. Wanna play the vanguard? You gonna be playing as Decimus Jackson Jr.- Cast and general cutscene presentation:The cast is tragically flat. Titus being a miserable cu** is fitting, but Gadriel is needlessly antagonistic just to construe drama, and Chairon is alright, I guess. Also zero facial expressions on Gadriel.Captain McAngus is the usual trope, hates your guts at first, but comes around when he realizes you were right all along. Boring, no air about him, probably just a GW mandated Phobos Captain miniature insert.Amon-Ra was so-so. He had some glimpses of personality and an overall interesting design, but there was just not enough screen time to really explore his character. I’d have wished for a more fleshed out characterization because there was good potential there, especially for a tzeentchian manipulator.Worst of all was Calgar though, no gravitas nor intensity, looked comical fighting. Could’ve had a badass scene of him 1on1ing the Swarmlord or something. Anything really to mark him as the chapter master. Quite disappointing.In general, it seems like they couldn’t match the intensity from the actual gameplay in the cutscenes. They feel lifeless, often uncanny and unfinished. I really wanted to be done with the campaign asap to enjoy ops mode without spoilers, which is not a good sign in my book.That being said, the actual meat of the game is good. Melee and shooting feel great, once you’ve gotten the hang of the combat flow. Tyranids are more developed on that front, with Tzeentch providing a slight spike in difficulty while lacking the satisfaction of gory finishers and internal faction dynamics.I’ll probably spend a good amount of time playing operations, as the classes feel distinct enough to get fresh experiences out of them, even with the limited mission set. A solid 7/10 for me as a Warhammer 40k enthusiast. Probably more of a 5-6/10 for tourists.",pro fantast visual captur aesthet good varieti playstyl among class good visual custom individu armour part satisfi gunplay mele viscer finish larg arsen weapon minor variat along progress path tyranid extrem well realiz nail scope swarm gargoyl swarm absolut manag convey scope tyranid invas even wors perfectli fine approxim given limit comput power tyranid dynam translat nice gameplay take warrior gaunt collaps take hive tyrant bring entir assault screech halt special bioform feel distinct accur lictor favourit fact auspex scan reveal initi boss encount basic predat sound cue whenev lictor lurk make great experiencecon charact cardboard cutout custom wan na play vanguard gon na play decimu jackson jr cast gener cutscen presentationth cast tragic flat titu miser cu fit gadriel needlessli antagonist constru drama chairon alright guess also zero facial express gadrielcaptain mcangu usual trope hate gut first come around realiz right along bore air probabl gw mandat phobo captain miniatur insertamonra soso glimps person overal interest design enough screen time realli explor charact id wish flesh character good potenti especi tzeentchian manipulatorworst calgar though gravita intens look comic fight couldv badass scene swarmlord someth anyth realli mark chapter master quit disappointingin gener seem like couldnt match intens actual gameplay cutscen feel lifeless often uncanni unfinish realli want done campaign asap enjoy op mode without spoiler good sign bookthat said actual meat game good mele shoot feel great youv gotten hang combat flow tyranid develop front tzeentch provid slight spike difficulti lack satisfact gori finish intern faction dynamicsil probabl spend good amount time play oper class feel distinct enough get fresh experi even limit mission set solid warhamm enthusiast probabl tourist

"This is one of those times when I wish there was a middle ground between Recommended and Not Recommended. Aside from what are largely circumstantial issues, such as the Epic Games integration and performance problems that some people are having, neither of which I have personally had a problem with; there are things that this game does right, and things that it does worse than the first game. I don't normally write reviews, and especially ones that are longer than a few sentences, but I feel like I have to say at least a few things about every general aspect of the game here.To start with the good sides:- Story: It serves its predecessor well, it answers a lot of questions with some subtle references which I really liked, and is overall well written, especially when compared to some of the recent 40k lore.- Visuals: The sense of scale is impressive, the fidelity is as you would expect from a AAA title, and the animation work is unique in the sense that it doesn't necessarily copy from either Space Marine or Astartes, but has its unique take on depicting space marines which is fluid and satisfying.- Audio: It's not on the same level as Darktide, especially in the soundtrack, but it gets the job done quite well in a lot of places. There are a few disappointing sounds, like the heavy bolter, but it otherwise manages to feel atmospheric.Now the bad or mediocre sides:- Gameplay: It's so hit and miss. When you break it down on paper, it sounds good, but the execution leaves something to be desired. The ranged combat is okay; the weapons are a bit too inaccurate during longer bursts for being carried by the superhuman warriors that space marines are, and most of them feel the same, with a lot feeling like they're less powerful than their counterparts in the first game, or fulfilling a purpose that another weapon can fulfill better. It's the melee combat that is the main problem. You're better off playing it like Dark Souls and rolling around, both in PVE and PVE, because parry is simply too inconsistent. It doesn't matter if you perfectly time your parry if you are already playing an animation, like an attack, because you cannot cancel that animation. This problem gets worse when the attacks, even for the knife and chainsword, are much slower and clunkier than their counterparts in the first game. Additionally, in PVE, enemies can interrupt your attacks by hitting you, but you cannot interrupt theirs using the same method, which makes it not only feel unfair, but also weightless. The animation-pause does more to hurt the experience than help, as timing gets offset every time you hit something. Finally, melee in PVP can be cheated easily by just rolling, kind of like you can cheat the PVE by just rolling. Do not even try for parrying, it's a gamble. All of this makes the combat feel unfinished or badly designed, and I really hope this is addressed because it is currently my biggest pet peeve about the gameplay.- Customisation: Nonexistent for Chaos, and practically nonexistent for space marines. With Chaos, each class is limited to a warband, so if you're playing a raptor for example, you will be a Night Lord. You can change colours, but you will still retain Night Lord model pieces, same goes for the other classes and warbands. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't exist for Chaos. For the Primaris, it is also very lackluster. There are less options than there were in the first game, and they're lacking in the variety department, especially when it comes to chapter-specific content. Also, please, for the love of the Emperor, give us back Space Marines. Not Primaris. Space Marines. Not everyone likes the Primaris designs, and I certainly don't. But I feel like this would fall on deaf ears, it's not like GW ever listens to what the community wants.Overall, it's a decent game. It's hard to judge because there are parts that are very good, and then there's a couple parts that are really bad, and it's hard to dictate which one outweighs the other because they're largely dependent on what the user expects from the game.",one time wish middl ground recommend recommend asid larg circumstanti issu epic game integr perform problem peopl neither person problem thing game right thing wors first game dont normal write review especi one longer sentenc feel like say least thing everi gener aspect game hereto start good side stori serv predecessor well answer lot question subtl refer realli like overal well written especi compar recent lore visual sens scale impress fidel would expect aaa titl anim work uniqu sens doesnt necessarili copi either space marin astart uniqu take depict space marin fluid satisfi audio level darktid especi soundtrack get job done quit well lot place disappoint sound like heavi bolter otherwis manag feel atmosphericnow bad mediocr side gameplay hit miss break paper sound good execut leav someth desir rang combat okay weapon bit inaccur longer burst carri superhuman warrior space marin feel lot feel like theyr less power counterpart first game fulfil purpos anoth weapon fulfil better mele combat main problem your better play like dark soul roll around pve pve parri simpli inconsist doesnt matter perfectli time parri alreadi play anim like attack cancel anim problem get wors attack even knife chainsword much slower clunkier counterpart first game addit pve enemi interrupt attack hit interrupt use method make feel unfair also weightless animationpaus hurt experi help time get offset everi time hit someth final mele pvp cheat easili roll kind like cheat pve roll even tri parri gambl make combat feel unfinish badli design realli hope address current biggest pet peev gameplay customis nonexist chao practic nonexist space marin chao class limit warband your play raptor exampl night lord chang colour still retain night lord model piec goe class warband far im concern doesnt exist chao primari also lacklust less option first game theyr lack varieti depart especi come chapterspecif content also pleas love emperor give us back space marin primari space marin everyon like primari design certainli dont feel like would fall deaf ear like gw ever listen commun wantsoveral decent game hard judg part good there coupl part realli bad hard dictat one outweigh theyr larg depend user expect game

"2023 So, my history with Total War Warhammer is complex. Since Warhammer Battle March, i was dreaming of Total War picking up this setting. When TWW I released, i bought it instantly and was in heaven. With TWW II i ascended beyond mortal planes of bliss as a Skaven Main. For real TWW II just made TWW I look like a tech demo. Mortal Empires and the excellent DLC content was just another cherry on top. TWW III actually did not excite me that much, but i was optimistic. Yes, i don't care for Ogres, Kislev and monogods. But its TWW and it will be fun. When it came out, i was pretty happy with it. There were tons of bugs and bad design decisions, but it was still fun and lots of content for it's price. At this point, many people were already vocalizing their discontent with the quality of CA's work, but i didn't (yet) share their opinion. In reality, the same thing that had happened to titles like Battlefield V or War Thunder happened to TWW: The developer studio disconnected from their players. Since Grace left the Community Management, relations worsened more and more. Player feedback was largely ignored. Praised features were discontinued. Bugs weren't adressed. In short, CA's modus operandi shifted from ""quality game to produce player goodwill and thus steady longterm income"" to ""make as much money as possible in as short a time frame as possible"". The deal with TWW used to be that the base game was very price efficient, lots of good content for 60 €, and that the DLC were less price efficient but freshened up the experience and stretched the base game content out. And this is the crux of the story: With the old race pack DLCs you got ~ 1/8 of the content for 1/4 of the price of the base game. That is fine and i have to date bought literally every single DLC. With the Chaos Dwarfs DLC that shifted to 1/8 of the content for around 1/2 half of the price of the base game. Understandably, people were upset, but at least they got a completely new race with great mechanics and 3 lords. Now, with the newest DLC, they charged the same price, but with way less content. In the old lord packs (those that dont introduce new races) the players got one new lord per faction and a few new units and heroes, that changed the whole playthrough. One additional lord was also released for free for all players. Lord packs always had a cost of 10 €. The new lord pack, Shadows of change, introduces three lords, but no free lord for everyone. The few new units are in part reskins. There are no heroes that shake up the playthroughs. The units are at best support units and are pretty irrelevant (Vortex beast maybe excepted, because it is cool). For this they charge 25 €. That is a 150 % price increase. CA has not taken the opportunity to overhaul mechanics the community has been calling out since release as unfinished, unfun or annoying. They have not communicated on player criticism. Even the content creators in CA's creator program have called this DLC out as a cash grab. So should you buy Warhammer III? Maybe, but the promise of TWW will not be kept. You will get no DLC you can stretch the base game with for a reasonable price. The bugs that plagued the game from release are still not fixed. We as consumers have only one way to vote and that is with our money. So no, i would not recommend you buy TWW III. Maybe CA wakes up and changes it's direction, like Gaijin has done with War Thunder. Maybe it will fall flat like Battlefield V. I wouldn't get invested if i were you.",histori total war warhamm complex sinc warhamm battl march dream total war pick set tww releas bought instantli heaven tww ii ascend beyond mortal plane bliss skaven main real tww ii made tww look like tech demo mortal empir excel dlc content anoth cherri top tww iii actual excit much optimist ye dont care ogr kislev monogod tww fun came pretti happi ton bug bad design decis still fun lot content price point mani peopl alreadi vocal discont qualiti ca work didnt yet share opinion realiti thing happen titl like battlefield v war thunder happen tww develop studio disconnect player sinc grace left commun manag relat worsen player feedback larg ignor prais featur discontinu bug werent adress short ca modu operandi shift qualiti game produc player goodwil thu steadi longterm incom make much money possibl short time frame possibl deal tww use base game price effici lot good content dlc less price effici freshen experi stretch base game content crux stori old race pack dlc got content price base game fine date bought liter everi singl dlc chao dwarf dlc shift content around half price base game understand peopl upset least got complet new race great mechan lord newest dlc charg price way less content old lord pack dont introduc new race player got one new lord per faction new unit hero chang whole playthrough one addit lord also releas free player lord pack alway cost new lord pack shadow chang introduc three lord free lord everyon new unit part reskin hero shake playthrough unit best support unit pretti irrelev vortex beast mayb except cool charg price increas ca taken opportun overhaul mechan commun call sinc releas unfinish unfun annoy commun player critic even content creator ca creator program call dlc cash grab buy warhamm iii mayb promis tww kept get dlc stretch base game reason price bug plagu game releas still fix consum one way vote money would recommend buy tww iii mayb ca wake chang direct like gaijin done war thunder mayb fall flat like battlefield v wouldnt get invest
"This game is just a masterpiece if u played souls like games (Dark Souls & Bloodborne). First of all it’s an open world game (dark souls and bloodborne no), the lore is insane and huge, the graphic it’s the greatest I’ve ever seen so far.

About performance on pc is kinda good, but there are some bugs which it depends on probably or from your game or pc specs like GPU.

Most of the bosses i have encountered have been pretty unique each with different movesets that it feels refreshing and fun when you encounter a new boss. The characters and story so far has been pretty intriguing, the lore especially has been pretty good in introducing newcomers to the mythology while for others who are already familiar, with references and tie in to the original sources material.For the negatives i have is the environmental and map design can get pretty confusing especially after chapter 2 and the lack of map contributes to me often being lost although that could be my horrible sense of direction. Lastly, the placement of the invisible walls after act 1 can be quite jarring as i have encounter paths that i thought could be traverse while other times i missed a path thinking that there is an invisible wall there.

"2022 Review Recap:After a few patches, the game has received some balance changes, fixes and etc.As it stands right now, it still is a PVE beauty, but that's not to say it doesnt have problems at all. In terms of PVP it still is a mess, even though the ""Dueler's code"" has gained awareness in the community, with some of the playerbase leaving due to ""DiFfIcUlTy"". (The game has issues in this regard, yes. But nothing that the casual playerbase or the not so good players are complaining about).Lets start with my personal issue, Don't worry, its just this one. (It has been patched slightly but it still stands) - The blood Katana: This weapon is just too much. Its a bleed proc weapon that does an insanely fast combo with fairly good range, minor FP consumption (not that it matters since you will win or die before that becomes an issue) and far too much damage!I've just finished fighting Miquella, and one of the summons I got (Two, in fact. Due to multiple attempts) used this Katana and shredded the boss's health in a couple of attacks.So... This weapon is insanely good for bosses, paired with pose and less damage on the mixed physick.Now... This is for PVE... For bosses... So as you can imagine, in PVP, the issue is about as problematic as it seems. Long range, bleed, tons of damage and fast.... Might as well just turn on an instant kill hack, and the effect shouldn't differ too much.Alright, so now what are some issues with the game itself. - The bosses are a bit uninspiring some times. I can't fully blame them for this though since there are so many, and quite a few are amazing, memorable and weird in a dark souls standard. However, this is not a dark souls game, so expecting to see a major dragon like Seath the Scaleless, just doesn't add up. - The movesets. Ok... So each boss seems to have taken a different take on their moveset than dark souls. This meaning that while in dark souls, the boss had moves that went well with each other and had certain rythms to be followed, Elden ring thought that this rythm in dark souls was already too familiar and decided to change. So attacks are slow with lingering hitboxes that don't make a ton of sense sometimes, or are just annoying, that and the combos are either insanely fast, or ridiculously slow.What do I mean with all of this? Well... Elden ring was tailor made to screw up with Souls gamers timings... Really screwing with what we had known from previous games to prevent it from being ""too easy for legacy players"". While I accept the difficulty change, and the rythm shifts, some moves still feel like they are robbing the player with how long the hitboxes last on some of their slow moves.- Some areas are also problematic since their design seems to be beginner level, with the difficulty being set by simply adding too many enemies in one location with what seems little thought to it (Mogh's area for example).- Some enemies also share this crappy design with them spamming and spazzing attacks at incredibly annoying speeds and more. They feel more of an annoyance than a challenge and that really hurts this game compared to previous souls games.Its a shame but I think Myasaki is losing his touch.I still very much enjoy the game and think it is absolutely fantastic in so many regards. Easily my GOTY choice just because of the sheer ammount of content, exploration, and everything else that this game does right.The exploration is mindblowing, the quest lines as mysterious and amazing as ever (No we do not need to know where they are. Searching is part of the fun), it just does everything else right.So despite everything bad mentioned above, the game still stands as a fantastic experience worth double the price it asks, at least for me. Keep in mind the things above are just the ones I considered bad, along with some community members. But regardless, the game is still a peak experience with gameplay, story, builds, creativity, everything else. And BY FAR, one of the best Worlds the Souls-Like Series from Fromsoft has ever had.Why the negative review then? Because most people search for the negatives to see if its worth buying the game or not, despite the bad things mentioned in these reviews.I hope this helps you all",review recapaft patch game receiv balanc chang fix etca stand right still pve beauti that say doesnt problem term pvp still mess even though dueler code gain awar commun playerbas leav due difficulti game issu regard ye noth casual playerbas good player complain aboutlet start person issu dont worri one patch slightli still stand blood katana weapon much bleed proc weapon insan fast combo fairli good rang minor fp consumpt matter sinc win die becom issu far much damag finish fight miquella one summon got two fact due multipl attempt use katana shred bosss health coupl attacksso weapon insan good boss pair pose less damag mix physicknow pve boss imagin pvp issu problemat seem long rang bleed ton damag fast might well turn instant kill hack effect shouldnt differ muchalright issu game boss bit uninspir time cant fulli blame though sinc mani quit amaz memor weird dark soul standard howev dark soul game expect see major dragon like seath scaleless doesnt add moveset ok boss seem taken differ take moveset dark soul mean dark soul boss move went well certain rythm follow elden ring thought rythm dark soul alreadi familiar decid chang attack slow linger hitbox dont make ton sens sometim annoy combo either insan fast ridicul slowwhat mean well elden ring tailor made screw soul gamer time realli screw known previou game prevent easi legaci player accept difficulti chang rythm shift move still feel like rob player long hitbox last slow move area also problemat sinc design seem beginn level difficulti set simpli ad mani enemi one locat seem littl thought mogh area exampl enemi also share crappi design spam spazz attack incred annoy speed feel annoy challeng realli hurt game compar previou soul gamesit shame think myasaki lose touchi still much enjoy game think absolut fantast mani regard easili goti choic sheer ammount content explor everyth els game rightth explor mindblow quest line mysteri amaz ever need know search part fun everyth els rightso despit everyth bad mention game still stand fantast experi worth doubl price ask least keep mind thing one consid bad along commun member regardless game still peak experi gameplay stori build creativ everyth els far one best world soulslik seri fromsoft ever hadwhi neg review peopl search neg see worth buy game despit bad thing mention reviewsi hope help

"As a die-hard Warhammer fan, I approached Warhammer: Space Marine with cautious optimism, trying to set my biases aside. So, what's my verdict? It’s… just okay. But let’s dive deeper into that.First off, it was undeniably fun to role-play as a badass Space Marine. Mowing down hordes of Xenos was incredibly satisfying, and every execution felt intensely gratifying. The PvP mode brought a wave of nostalgia, reminding me of the old-school shooters from the 2010s. Simple, but effective—and despite being a bit undercooked, it was highly enjoyable. Admittedly, I spent most of my time in PvP after finishing the campaign. The different classes felt distinct, and each had its own utility without any glaring balance issues.On the PvE side, it’s a solid option for some casual co-op fun with friends—perfect for those laid-back Friday nights. If you're a Warhammer fan, especially one who loves Space Marines, there’s a lot to appreciate here. The customization options for your Space Marine are extensive, letting you personalize your character as much or as little as you want, which is a nice touch.Visually, the game is impressive, though the controls can feel a bit clunky at first. Thankfully, customizable keybindings help smooth out the experience. However, some of the animations feel stiff, and the AI companions can be frustratingly inept, especially during defense missions on higher difficulties.The real highlight is PvP combat. While the mechanics are simple, the execution is satisfying, and the customization options, especially for loyalist Space Marines, are deep—giving off a “dress to impress” vibe reminiscent of classic games. The Heretical Astartes, though, don’t get the same love in terms of customization, which is a missed opportunity.But this is where the praise tapers off. The story? Basic, with a straightforward premise that doesn’t leave much to chew on once you’ve put the controller down. PvP, while fun, is limited to just three game modes and a handful of maps. And, despite the engaging core gameplay, the lack of meaningful progression holds it back from being something truly special. I also encountered a few bugs that don’t seem to have been widely discussed yet. For instance, my character would sometimes randomly fly across the map, or worse, every character—including mine—would start clipping through the floors. Fortunately, reloading from the last checkpoint or restarting the game usually fixed these issues, but it was still a frustrating experience.The final boss, especially on higher difficulties, dragged on far too long, making it feel like it overstayed its welcome and left a bit of a sour taste by the end.In the end, Warhammer: Space Marine is a decent experience, but it falls short in key areas that could have made it great.Remember, brothers: the Emperor helps those who help themselves",diehard warhamm fan approach warhamm space marin cautiou optim tri set bias asid what verdict okay let dive deeper thatfirst undeni fun roleplay badass space marin mow hord xeno incred satisfi everi execut felt intens gratifi pvp mode brought wave nostalgia remind oldschool shooter simpl effectiveand despit bit undercook highli enjoy admittedli spent time pvp finish campaign differ class felt distinct util without glare balanc issueson pve side solid option casual coop fun friendsperfect laidback friday night your warhamm fan especi one love space marin there lot appreci custom option space marin extens let person charact much littl want nice touchvisu game impress though control feel bit clunki first thank customiz keybind help smooth experi howev anim feel stiff ai companion frustratingli inept especi defens mission higher difficultiesth real highlight pvp combat mechan simpl execut satisfi custom option especi loyalist space marin deepgiv dress impress vibe reminisc classic game heret astart though dont get love term custom miss opportunitybut prais taper stori basic straightforward premis doesnt leav much chew youv put control pvp fun limit three game mode hand map despit engag core gameplay lack meaning progress hold back someth truli special also encount bug dont seem wide discuss yet instanc charact would sometim randomli fli across map wors everi characterinclud minewould start clip floor fortun reload last checkpoint restart game usual fix issu still frustrat experienceth final boss especi higher difficulti drag far long make feel like overstay welcom left bit sour tast endin end warhamm space marin decent experi fall short key area could made greatrememb brother emperor help help

I have no idea why I should bother with Eternaland. Some processes are unnecessarily complicated.

"2022 At the time of this review I finished the prologue and 1 campaign as Kugath.Good:- Animation work has to be the best in the industry- Fleshed out story and lore- Graphics improved and the art direction is fantastic.- Siege rework, not perfect but a huge improvement to the old style- Diplomacy rework seems perfect. Everything needed and more included (I love the outposts) but it should be noted that I didnt play around with it too much yet.- Lots of content to keep you busy till the (im)mortal empires update- Clearer information for pretty much everything (like the values for diplomacy, which stats increase during level up etc.)Bad:- There is no option to turn the tutorial off in the prologue which is a shame for experienced players because the story is good but for veterans its quite annoying to learn how to right click an enemy.- The chaos realms are visually amazing but survival battles at the end of each realm really drag (Luckily you can autoresolve these).- Some changes seem for the sake of changing things.

"Super fun game so far and graphically stunning. The game is paced pretty fast so you don't get bored, and the maps are pretty straightforward and mostly linear (reminds me of the maps in older games like darksiders and stuff where each part of the map is its own section that you can fully explore). It depends on you if you like vast open worlds or something more straighforward like this. I, for one, have had my fair share of open world so this was actually a welcome surprise (100% a game is in sight once more). Fights are also fast paced and fun, with a similar style to dark souls albeit it arguably easier.

(And/or understanding Warhammer 40K lore)A 3 man Co-op ""Operations"" mode that sees you play as your own different Marines that you can customize head to toe (from 6 different classes) and go on missions with other aspiring recruits/players trying to level up and score better gear.Though at the moment there are only 6 missions to complete. They mostly feel good to play through, and multiple runs are needed to upgrade and level up your Space Marine.(This is also the live-service, seasonal part of the game so expect content updates unless something completely unexpected happens).There is also a very fun but very dry no nonsense PVP akin to old COD lobbies but without the vulgarities, racism, and probably no no-scopes (yet). Hope the devs update this ""Eternal War"" mode as well cause there is some good building blocks to work with.Combat is very fun, consisting of dodges and parries to outmaneuver and counterattack the enemy respectively. Not too much to learn other than the timings of parries/dodges and melee combos of each weapon but the chaotic horde-style gameplay will still sometimes give you problems even if you have mastered the intricate art of murdering other Alien lifeforms.8.5/10 or 9/10 if you are already a fan of 40K.",game feel like bygon age one microsoft xbox put fight mayb even win soni consol war greatan entertain linear stori mode around hour normal mode though maximum enjoy play least seen recap space marin andor understand warhamm lorea man coop oper mode see play differ marin custom head toe differ class go mission aspir recruitsplay tri level score better gearthough moment mission complet mostli feel good play multipl run need upgrad level space marinethi also liveservic season part game expect content updat unless someth complet unexpect happensther also fun dri nonsens pvp akin old cod lobbi without vulgar racism probabl noscop yet hope dev updat etern war mode well caus good build block work withcombat fun consist dodg parri outmaneuv counterattack enemi respect much learn time parriesdodg mele combo weapon chaotic hordestyl gameplay still sometim give problem even master intric art murder alien alreadi fan
"The good: The game is amazing, especially for one so fresh from early access. There are loads of things to with high, med, and low intensity so you can do something to progress no matter what kind of content you're looking for. The story is great and very compelling. Every single bug or issue I've had with the game has been such a minor thing that it honestly doesn't take away from the game for me at all and the support team is VERY good at responding. Sometimes they use cookie cutter responses but I see no issue with that either because its generally just for things like when they're acknowledging your ticket. The bad: I've experienced multiple bugs but given how small they were I'm honestly not even bothered. None of them prevented me from doing any content in any way. It was small things like, for example, sometimes resources don't stack properly. I had 2 stacks of gravel that should have stacked together but they would not so the result of the bug was losing a single storage space for a short time. Overall: This is easily one of my favorite games that has come out in a very, very long time and would love to see it become more popular.",good game amaz especi one fresh earli access load thing high med low intens someth progress matter kind content your look stori great compel everi singl bug issu ive game minor thing honestli doesnt take away game support team good respond sometim use cooki cutter respons see issu either gener thing like theyr acknowledg ticket bad ive experienc multipl bug given small im honestli even bother none prevent content way small thing like exampl sometim resourc dont stack properli stack gravel stack togeth would result bug lose singl storag space short time overal easili one favorit game come long time would love see becom popular

"2022 I love the total war games, especially the Warhammer franchise. This is my first ever review on Steam, I usually don't even bother to review bad games. But this game is UNPLAYABLE. Warhammer II was hands down the best total war ever. However, this is a disaster.1) Performance issues- Running this game WILL KILL your PC. There are hundreds of Redditers have already mentioned, this game will bring your PC to 90C or even 100C. The game will crash, your PC will crash, it's a sh*t show.2) Campaign bugs - Siege- Siege battles are unplayable. The over all campaign and new mechanics are good. Siege battles are more difficult which is reasonable. Warhammer II was also fun cheesing all the siege battles. But Warhammer III is just broken, AI's towers just keep rebuilding unlimited amount of towers regardless of the timer. Sometime, it allows you attack during construction but sometime it doesn't.CA ruined the franchise, when all these fans waited years for a finale of the series, they decided to give us an unfinished product, in every aspect, from optimization to the gameplay itself. CA should be ashamed of what they've done to us. And I think after this game, all the players have lost their faith in them until they fix the issues.",love total war game especi warhamm franchis first ever review steam usual dont even bother review bad game game unplay warhamm ii hand best total war ever howev perform issu run game kill pc hundr reddit alreadi mention game bring pc even game crash pc crash sht campaign bug sieg sieg battl unplay campaign new mechan good sieg battl difficult reason warhamm ii also fun chees sieg battl warhamm iii broken ai tower keep rebuild unlimit amount tower regardless timer sometim allow attack construct sometim doesntca ruin franchis fan wait year final seri decid give us unfinish product everi aspect optim gameplay ca asham theyv done us think game player lost faith fix issu
"2022 The main campaign has just so much annoying stuff in it, if you just want to conquer the map on your own pace.Enemy armies are spawning every few turns right in the middle of your territory, so you have to keep multiple of you own armies just sitting inside settlements to defend them if needed. For Khorne this is especially stupid, because every idle army will reduce all your cities growth by 10, so you can't level them up.Enemy armies that are raiding your territory somehow always have enough movement left to escape if you try to fight them.I really hope that Immortal Empires will have the good old ""do what you want and conquer the world"" without all the annoying campaign stuff based around a big, sad and lonely ice bear.EDIT: Immortal Empires is the good old sandbox mode.

"For almost a decade, I wished for a sequel to Space Marine.I was afraid it would never happen. THQ crashing and burning had left the possibility of a true sequel in limbo. In spite of Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam, and a fairly large cult following, I had doubt that anyone would pick up the ball, and finish what Relic started.Then, to my shock, a couple years ago, a trailer drops.I wanted to shout for joy, but almost instantly, I became skeptical. Worried that my beloved game could never have the sequel it deserved in our current development culture. The new studio would gut it of what made it's soul, insert contrived modern tropes and disrespect the source and setting. I have NEVER been so happy to be wrong.Space Marine 2 is Marvelous. Jaw-Dropping.Saber has taken Relics Masterpiece to new heights, added new mechanics that enhance the experience and expanded the multiplayer, seamlessly weaving it into the campaign, making it far more interesting and addictive that it's predecessor. It's BIGGER, BLOODIER and even more BAD*SS.Titus' story continues, wonderfully connected to the previous installment, ending it's chapter with a promise of more, and leaving me READY for the next sequel. SM2 NAILS the vibe of Warhammer 40k, outright stunning at few moments. The setting and the previous game are treated with reverence and attention to detail.For hours, I lost myself, engaged, immersed and awestruck at the spectacle, even more so because I had come to believe it would never happen.Bravo, Saber, Focus, GW and Everyone who made this happen.",almost decad wish sequel space marinei afraid would never happen thq crash burn left possibl true sequel limbo spite overwhelmingli posit review steam fairli larg cult follow doubt anyon would pick ball finish relic startedthen shock coupl year ago trailer dropsi want shout joy almost instantli becam skeptic worri belov game could never sequel deserv current develop cultur new studio would gut made soul insert contriv modern trope disrespect sourc set never happi wrongspac marin marvel jawdroppingsab taken relic masterpiec new height ad new mechan enhanc experi expand multiplay seamlessli weav campaign make far interest addict predecessor bigger bloodier even badsstitu stori continu wonder connect previou instal end chapter promis leav readi next sequel nail vibe warhamm outright stun moment set previou game treat rever attent detailfor hour lost engag immers awestruck spectacl even come believ would never happenbravo saber focu gw everyon made happen

"The core game here is great. The enemy variety leaves a little to be desired, interface slightly clunky, and the side missions are (so far) inconsistent.I am starting to hate the way they've tied health and armor systems into melee. Especially on higher difficulties it's just not feasible to regain health in certain fights.Additionally the TE-style red/blue rings for dodges and parrys ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ suck. It feels like a duck tape solution to their wanting to implement dark souls-esque timing requiments while filling the screen with swarms of enemies. It becomes and annoying indecipherable mess.Oh and the ammo replenishment mechanics do not work in boss fights that physically yank your camera away to LOOK AT BIRD when your trying to replenish ammo.Good 40k game, but there's a lot of jank getting in the way of a great overall experience.7/10",core game great enemi varieti leav littl desir interfac slightli clunki side mission far inconsistenti start hate way theyv tie health armor system mele especi higher difficulti feasibl regain health certain fightsaddit testyl redblu ring dodg parri suck feel like duck tape solut want implement dark soulsesqu time requiment fill screen swarm enemi becom annoy indecipher messoh ammo replenish mechan work boss fight physic yank camera away look bird tri replenish ammogood game there lot jank get way great overal

"This game was bit of a let down after seeing a lot of hype. The combat feels like a sloppy version of a 'souls like' with weird hit boxes and extremely limited options on how you wish to fight. The game is very linear pushing you from one boss to another, you fight each one with a loadout the game wants you to have, there is no variety, there is no choice beyond the talents. You pickup the minimal items between bosses and that's it. It becomes a stale boss grind extremely quickly with very little else to it. Boss -> few npcs, 2/3 items on ground - > Boss -> few npcs, 2/3 items on ground - > Boss etc, repeat for entire game. What I enjoy in souls games is that you can go to X location for this weapon and Y location for this armour to make a build fun, you can grind stats to do specific things, wield specific items, whereas wukong has none of this.The game looks nice, the graphics are very good but performance is not brilliant with quite a few areas causing stuttering or lag however this type of issue will likely be patched out in the future so i don't give that much weight in my overall opinion. I would give this game maybe a 6/10, it was fun for a few hours but got stale very quickly even when progressing rapidly through bosses. I haven't felt compelled to go back and play more at any point, the game hasn't drawn me in at all, in fact thinking about the cost it feels very meh for what i paid. If you enjoy an endless boss spam action game this will be your cup of tea, if you want something with a bit more depth and variety i think you will be disappointed",game bit let see lot hype combat feel like sloppi version soul like weird hit box extrem limit option wish fight game linear push one boss anoth fight one loadout game want varieti choic beyond talent pickup minim item boss that becom stale boss grind extrem quickli littl els boss npc item ground boss npc item ground boss etc repeat entir game enjoy soul game go x locat weapon locat armour make build fun grind stat specif thing wield specif item wherea wukong none thisth game look nice graphic good perform brilliant quit area caus stutter lag howev type issu like patch futur dont give much weight overal opinion would give game mayb fun hour got stale quickli even progress rapidli boss havent felt compel go back play point game hasnt drawn fact think cost feel meh paid enjoy endless boss spam action game cup tea want someth bit depth varieti think disappoint

"There are no words to appropriately describe the immense joy and fun I have while playing this game. Elden Ring takes concepts from other Soulsborne titles, improves upon them, and goes beyond expectation. The open world is beautiful with a lot of locations to explore and goodies to grab. The bosses are fun, challenging, and always satisfying to beat. With such a wide variety of content to explore, it is very difficult to run out of things to do. It's why I have so many hours in this game: I never got bored of it.My main criticism come more from personal experience rather than concepts the game has. Notably, the world feels smaller when you learn where everything is and avoid places to fight bosses or get items you don't need. This is to be expected as with other entries to the franchise, the experience feels linear and shorter with each playthrough. Despite this, I am still amazed at this beautiful world each time I ride through it.Please do yourself a favor and try this game. It is difficult, punishing at times, but the immense satisfaction and relief from beating a boss you've been stuck on for 5 hours never fails to make the mood better. Who knows, you may just find a personal favorite encounter.",word appropri describ immens joy fun play game elden ring take concept soulsborn titl improv upon goe beyond expect open world beauti lot locat explor goodi grab boss fun challeng alway satisfi beat wide varieti content explor difficult run thing mani hour game never got bore itmi main critic come person experi rather concept game notabl world feel smaller learn everyth avoid place fight boss get item dont need expect entri franchis experi feel linear shorter playthrough despit still amaz beauti world time ride itpleas favor tri game difficult punish time immens satisfact relief beat boss youv stuck hour never fail make mood better know may find person favorit encount

"2022 solid game, very enjoyable and worth your time. I write this review after beating the game twice with one character, and a third time with a second character using a different build. I also have all achievements which tells you that I like this game enough to do that.As much as I like the game, some of the late game bosses are just not fun.I'm a big souls fan, and have played and beaten each and every souls title including DeS and BB, and this is the first game in which there are bosses that are just not good. Defeating these cheeselords doesn't make you feel like you overcame adversity with your own skill and knowledge, it makes you feel either very lucky that you didn't get hit with a 20 second long combo with giant aoes and teleporting sweep attacks, or very mildly happy that you just cheesed the boss with a mimic tear and a moonveil + 10. I don't think the game is 'too hard', just that it literally is not fun for me to fight some of the endgame bosses. I'm hoping that there are some balance patches to address some of the balance issues present in the game, hopefully a few bosses get some tuning, and hopefully moonveil gets a much needed damage reduction because ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ why use anything else as an int build when you can one shot invaders lol",solid game enjoy worth time write review beat game twice one charact third time second charact use differ build also achiev tell like game enough thata much like game late game boss funim big soul fan play beaten everi soul titl includ de bb first game boss good defeat cheeselord doesnt make feel like overcam advers skill knowledg make feel either lucki didnt get hit second long combo giant aoe teleport sweep attack mildli happi chees boss mimic tear moonveil dont think game hard liter fun fight endgam boss im hope balanc patch address balanc issu present game hope boss get tune hope moonveil get much need damag reduct use anyth els int build one shot invad lol

"This is a big breath of freash air for me atleast, i have for the longest time been trying to find a new survival game to scratch my itch like Ark Survival Evolved did for me and this game just hit the right spot! Well atleast for me, yeah sure there are bugs and glitches as there are in almost all games there is today but in my experience it has been really good and not that glitchy or buggy since the game is so new, look at ark for example, it has been out for so long and there still is game breaking glitches and bugs but this doesn't even come close to that. So i simply think this game is amazing and really enjoyable, i got so into it that i loost track of time and all of a sudden 12+ hours had gone by in my first sitting and it's surprisingly really well optimized, the only thing i wish there was for this game is private dedicated servers that you could run for only your friends since having to share with so many people on one server can be really annoying when it comes to territory space. Other than that i highly recommend this game to lone wolfs or groups of friends!!",big breath freash air atleast longest time tri find new surviv game scratch itch like ark surviv evolv game hit right spot well atleast yeah sure bug glitch almost game today experi realli good glitchi buggi sinc game new look ark exampl long still game break glitch bug doesnt even come close simpli think game amaz realli enjoy got loost track time sudden hour gone first sit surprisingli realli well optim thing wish game privat dedic server could run friend sinc share mani peopl one server realli annoy come territori space highli recommend game lone wolf group friend

"7ish hours, not for me.I'm assuming much of these will feel better later on in the game but I don'f feel the drive to want to get there.Every positive aspect has an equal negative aspect.Its very pretty, but very busy.Navigating the world is fine when you're on flat ground but there are a lot of collision issues and hang ups, no climbing mechanic. I want to explore because its so pretty, but its on rails with a lot of underwhelming rewards, dead ends and invisible walls for doing so.No map.The moment to moment combat is what kills it for me.I feel like it wants to be God of War and Souls, but doesn't know which one, and is missing the best of both.The combat is floaty and restrictive, unresponsive, clunky and tedious.Some attacks feel nice and weighty, but this is rare.No other weapon types than the staff. Spirits and transformations are cool but they are flavor, not foundation.Main light attack is essentially required. The initiating attack is fast, but then you sit through a big flashy animation waiting for the next hit/s to show up in the middle of some spinny nonsense.Heavy attack has some nice unlocks, but they all require a set up and a waiting period to get it out, unless you pepper them in with your combos, but the chances of you getting interrupted are high.Crowd clearing is rough, there may be some AOE heavy hitters later but being limited to mostly single target to clear trash mobs gets tiring quickly.You get interrupted very often.

"2022 A modern masterpiece Fromsoftware took everything they learned from the Souls series, applying it towards a game that redefines what an open world game can be. Consistently, I found myself wondering how they could have packed so much incredible content into the game, while not sacrificing the immense scope, and having killed the final boss, and roughly 29 other bosses (my play time is actually much longer than steam says, for some reason the playtime, I still find myself wondering. Although performance issues are a problem on PC, I have been relatively lucky since launch, even thought my system is far worse than some other reviewers who have experienced issues (Ryzen 7 1700x, and a GTX 1080). At this point, however, what few performance issues I did have are gone, and I'm able to run the game buttery smooth at high settings, with only the occasional dip when exploring the over-world. The game isn't perfect, however. There are a few too many repeated boss encounters, and some of the boss encounters rely a bit too heavily on taking another enemy and multiplying them, instead of adding a new boss entirely. There is also a recurrent problem of certain enemy types appearing too often. This is helped, however, by the remarkable number of enemy types that are wholly unique, to the point where, after beating the final boss, I went exploring and happened across a new enemy type I hadn't seen before, even though I had thought I had seen everything that wasn't a reused asset. All this said, the game is most definitely flawed, but the flaws do not detract from the game in any meaningful way, and you would be doing yourself a disservice not to play the game, and see if the Souls genre is right for you.

"This is definitely a fun game to play, stunning view everywhere in the game, tons of legendary monsters/gods from famous eastern novel (first ever seen in 3A games), challenging bosses, smooth action playing, interesting skill/growth system, etc. All these are combined in the game well and with thoughtful design. I can see the producers/devs put massive efforts on this game, and give birth to such a masterpiece of eastern fantasy world. There is one that could be improved for sure, better in-game guidance (mini-map or directional tool at least to tell me north/south), and no other complaints.

"I guess this is a hot take, so bring on the clown awards, but in my opinion, Black Myth Wukong does not live up to the hype. It's absolutely lacking in so many ways I couldn't believe what I was playing based on the reviews I read and I'm sorry if that steps on the toes of your new favorite game, but it's true. I was in no way compelled to continue playing this after the first session and here's why:For starters, the game's performance is unstable at best, even on my 3080ti, i9 CPU, 32GB RAM, liquid cooled machine. It constantly and unexpectedly dipped down to laughably low frame rates to the point that I thought the game was being ran by Microsoft Power Point, even with most of the settings on low and medium, RTX off, DLSS set to performance and frames capped at 120. Unacceptable.Looking past that, the world traversal is some of the most boring gaming I've done in decades. There is nothing to do other than fight a handful of trash mobs, find some meditation spots and then fight bosses. And I mean like every 10ft, there's a new boss. I never even understand why I'm fighting them half the time and they're super forgettable. The title should really be ""Wukong: Boss Rush"" or something more accurate like that. I learn the fights just long enough to beat them and then I never think about them again after they're over.And the game's scenery is so ridiculously bland that everything looks the same to me. There are no useful land marks and no map/minimap, so you're constantly getting lost and back tracking in circles. On top of that, they do absolutely nothing to make you 'feel' like a monkey God while running around. You have a basic sprint and that's it. No cool flips. No world interaction. No wall runs. No climbing. No swinging. No staff tricks. Not even a double jump... It is painfully boring to run around in this game and OMG the amount of invisible walls and dead ends that should be explorable is infuriating.The core gameplay loop is:1. sluggishly traverse through an uninteresting area2. kill trash mobs until you stumble across a boss3. spend an hour learning its gimmicky move set4. finally beat it and repeat, that's itThis game is just way too shallow and bland right now. I got bored in the first sitting and I have no will to even finish it. I will admit though, that the bosses are beautifully crafted and have very imaginative designs that ultimately don't matter because they all seem to have the same basic concept: Rush-down AI, spam attacks, then reset every so often. It felt like I was fighting the same boss reskinned over and over and over, even after 7 hours of play time. Not to mention that some fights are literally just ripped from other games with almost zero changes, like Ornstein and Smough for example.Moving on from that, the game's main draw (the combat) is extremely hollow. There is no block system. No parry system. No backstab system. No stealth system. You literally have a dodge and a stick. The rest comes from a handful of spells, stances and transformations (which are also inconsistent, like, why can't I even JUMP while I'm transformed???) The dodge windows feel awful. Enemies will stun lock you constantly. Tons of CC. Input scanning. Animation locks. Overpowered status effects like poison and fire. Spongy enemies with inflated health pools. Bosses become impervious to your attacks, but they can still hit you. Every cheesy trick in the book to create artificial difficulty and prolonged encounters. It is more frustrating than rewarding and when you finally beat something, you won't feel accomplished, you'll just be happy you got lucky enough to beat the enemy's gimmick one time after hours of failure with nothing to look forward to except doing it all over again in about 10ft.Wukong, to me, is desperately trying to be a mash-up of Dark Souls and God of War, but it fails on both counts. I think the potential is there, but it still needs a while to cook before it gets to the level that these botted reviews would have you believe it's at. Make the areas/maps more interesting and less linear (a true open world would be even better). Bring these beautiful characters to the forefront and really lean into the story. Make the boss mechanics feel more unique in each fight. Improve the traversal. Optimize the performance. Fix these issues and the game's underlying potential will start to shine through.It does some things well, like character designs, musical scores, graphics and beautifully cinematic moments, but it falls flat in so many other ways that I genuinely can't recommend this game in its current state. I really wish I hadn't purchased it yet, as it might be worth playing sometime late next year or in 2026. If not, maybe the inevitable Wukong 2 will hit the mark in ways this one couldn't, but as it stands, this ain't it for me. I would refund if I could.-----Edit: For anyone who might be wondering why my playtime keeps going up after a review like this, it's quite frankly because I paid $60 for the game and I don't want that money to go to waste, so I'm going to finish it.

"2022 The best word to describe this game is ""AGAIN??!!!"" Everything overstays its welcome, everything becomes a chore. The other reviews will tell you everything you need to know about the portals and why they're bad.But the thing is, the portals just exacerbate problems the series has been struggling with for a very long time.There's too much busywork. Too many pointless magic items to collect, too many followers to assign, too many dumb AI agents wandering around the map pointlessly sabotaging empty settlements.At a deeper level, victories and defeats just don't mean enough. Kill the greater chaos demon of whatever and he'll pop back up in no time at all. There are no pivotal battles. Everything comes down to attrition: can you minimise your losses enough that you don't need to spend too much time recuperating and can therefore outpace your rivals in the race for the 4 souls? That's it.I think that this all stems from the fact that managing an empire isn't really fun in Total War games in general, and certainly not in the Warhammer series. There are just too many towns and cities to conquer, looking after them is too much of a slog, and there aren't enough interesting decisions to make: you're under constant assault, so there's not much you can do but pump out the most cost-effective armies you can and march them at the enemy.Surely the campaign side of Total War should be about positioning your armies to get the jump on your enemies? Like you would in, y'know, a war! There's hardly any of this. You can go into ambush stance, but that's about it: the rest is just walking one army into another. It could have been so much more exciting: what if an ambush involved actually plotting a stealthy route to intercept an enemy army instead of pure rng? What if you could wall off chokepoints, or make decisions about what time of day (or night) to make a move etc.? Without this, you just have watered-down Civ with great battles that get repetitive because there are just too darn many of them.",best word describ game everyth overstay welcom everyth becom chore review tell everyth need know portal theyr badbut thing portal exacerb problem seri struggl long timether much busywork mani pointless magic item collect mani follow assign mani dumb ai agent wander around map pointlessli sabotag empti settlementsat deeper level victori defeat dont mean enough kill greater chao demon whatev hell pop back time pivot battl everyth come attrit minimis loss enough dont need spend much time recuper therefor outpac rival race soul that iti think stem fact manag empir isnt realli fun total war game gener certainli warhamm seri mani town citi conquer look much slog arent enough interest decis make your constant assault there much pump costeffect armi march enemysur campaign side total war posit armi get jump enemi like would yknow war there hardli go ambush stanc that rest walk one armi anoth could much excit ambush involv actual plot stealthi rout intercept enemi armi instead pure rng could wall chokepoint make decis time day night make move etc without watereddown civ great battl get repetit darn mani

"2017 This review was changed for the third time so far. The first review was made when the CZ was a rifle, second review was made in 2019, and i believe the third and last review will be found all the way in the bottom Let's give this game an honest review.Okay I wanna start by saying that I am a CS series Fan. I have countless hours in CS 1.6, CSCZ (LuL i know) and CSS. And from all these titles I think CSGO is the worst of them all.I will explain my negative experience with ""Garbage GO"" by splitting this entire topic into 3 sub categories: Community, Balance, Developer Support.Community:The community pretty much consists of 3 main groups of people:1. Easter European Children,2. Normal People,3. Cheaters.CS never had a problem with toxic and annoying communities however it all changed when CSGO came. I mean Jesus I cant join Casual because there is a ♥♥♥♥ load of kids running around and screaming, I can't play on community servers because they are usually 64 people cancer, and competitive just doesn't cut it I mean I like it but I don't want to try hard every time I play this game.Don't get me wrong you can find your occasional good people. But out of 10 matchmaking games 9 times you wish you never met those people.Gun Balance:Okay this one is good.Gun balance doesn't really exist in this game anymore. See back then we used to have the AK, M4, AWP, MP5 and Deagle. Everything else was either situational or a miss click.... See even though these 5 guns where super good and where the only ones used they where perfectly balanced with each other. Meaning that the top tier guns where BALANCED!!!!This is not the case in CSGO. AWP is stiff asf***!, pistols are pure PTSD!, riffles have either not enough damage or weird hit reg, and in general the gun balance considering SMG's, heavy weapons is just ........ JESUS!Take the gun balance of CSGO, but only the gun balance don't look at the brand only the gun balance. If any other game had this type of balance it would be reviewed to DEATH! The gun balance is garbage and everyone who remotely tells me that the gun balance makes sense I just wanna say that what they are saying IS BLASPHEMY!!!! Developer Support: After the AUG being overpowered as ♥♥♥♥ and the Revolver being a pocket AWP it is clear to see that Valve doesn't test updates like ever.... How can such a big company on one of their most sold games not test updates before they release them it is a mystery to me. Even after millions valve received there is no working anti cheat system, and the only good content that is being released are skins which some of them cost into the thousands when kids in Africa starve. It is disgusting!!!!All the major tournaments, money and skins will never make this game good.If the gun balance and Developer Support is not there this game will awlays remain MEH. I am not a little kid you can feed of with some shinny fade skins. I am very very VERY! sorry what happened with CSGO. I don't recommend this game. Try it out yourself and loose faith in big gaming companies. 2019 review >>>Steam offered me to revise my review after additional 86 hours played on this game. The game still is taking weird turns facing the tides of time. CSGO is in one of the best situations a CS game has ever been (beside 1.6, but taking 1.6 is simply unfair towards any game in the gaming industry). Maps are constantly improved and guns are kinda balanced after a lot of mistakes done prior. The game is healthier especially after fooooorknight zapped most of the kids out of this cursed community over here. I am a casual player and my casual needs are satisfied. I have only 220 hours in this game because i have other choices, however if those other choices would have not been there id have more hours in this game. I am a CS series fan and always will be :). I follow the majors, and follow updates and changes mad. I watch CSGO related videos, and here and there i chip in 1 hour of play time either comp or casual. The game is in a waaaay better position than it was last time i gave an opinion on it. And dare i say i can recommend it. for the money you'd pay for being able to do matchmaking and stuff its alright. 2020 >>>The game has picked itself up from the fire. Volvo finally put some elbow grease into development and the game was luckily saved from the shambles it once found itself in. There are new operations dropped every now and then. Even though I'm not a friend of the season pass type of content drop concept I do not mind it as it does not keep me from enjoying all the different facets of the game. Still in 2020 we find the usual problems: hitboxes, hitreg, running ak headshots etc. However things are less annoying than before and vac actually works halfway decent nowadays. Beside that prime matchmaking does keep lobbies clean to some extend due to overwatch etc but still you will run into cheaters. With all of that being said. The game is good. The game is back because the competition almost zapped CS:GO out of gaming world.

"FOR AUSSIES/KIWIS:Once Human has been INCREDIBLY fun so far - the exploration, combat and quests are incredibly immersive and you can easily lose time playing. Plus, it's free and no way near P2W, which is a MASSIVE bonus (hopefully this doesn't change). The only downside (primarily for Australians/Kiwis) is that there are no Oceania servers. I've had to jump ship to the EU and play on a server that gives me between 280 to 300 ping. I am lucky that I am accustomed to this with another game I play, but I know that others were easily feeling frustrated with the lag/ping issues. I'd love to hop into a server with my mates where we have decent ping, but even that was a struggle connecting to other servers like Southeast Asia or Japan. Not to mention the fact that my timezone forces me to play when the server activity is low, so I have to wait for EU pals to wake up, or play with my other friend who has to deal with the ping spikes. Massive drawback. It hasn't fully ruined the game for me, but the low ""population"" within the server list and then it's actually full is another issue entirely, you have to coordinate with your friends that day of joining a server, any late joiners? Good luck finding a spot on that server. Hopefully the character limit is expanded upon and potential Oceania servers are introduced. Overall, so far there's been bumps, but it's been fun so far. However, there is room for improvement. If there was a middle ground recommendation, I would click that. I will rate it ""yes"", but it's honestly mixed.",aussieskiwisonc human incred fun far explor combat quest incred immers easili lose time play plu free way near massiv bonu hope doesnt chang downsid primarili australianskiwi oceania server ive jump ship eu play server give ping lucki accustom anoth game play know other easili feel frustrat lagp issu id love hop server mate decent ping even struggl connect server like southeast asia japan mention fact timezon forc play server activ low wait eu pal wake play friend deal ping spike massiv drawback hasnt fulli ruin game low popul within server list actual full anoth issu entir coordin friend day join server late joiner good luck find spot server hope charact limit expand upon potenti oceania server introduc overal far there bump fun far howev room improv middl ground recommend would click rate ye honestli mix

"The game is great and i enjoy it, but i can't recommend it. Aside from the fact my computer is starting to get random issues ever since i played the game (yesterday my wi-fi completely shut down while playing the game, forcing me to reset the network card for the first time in years), the game encounters some difficulty spikes that would be frustrating for player not as determined that i am. The game felt fairly easy until the tiger boss, as a souls veteran, but this boss was like going from fighting mouses to fighting a rock giant, compared to any of the other bosses. And the next one, that follows right next, is the same kind of difficulty without anything to really fight in between to upgrade your character.Until now, the game pace was flowing, offering you to craft a new armor before a major boss, get new points to spend in the ability trees. What you would expect from an action RPG as the devs claim the game to be. But now, all of the sudden, the game became a souls like out of nowhere. And if i enjoy soulslike, this game is not advertised as one so i can't recommand this game as an action-RPG to any people who do not enjoy difficulty, as you will encounter a wall mid playthrough.Edit : So after spending a few more hours in it, a few bosses later, i'd say the biggest issue of the game is the basics of the fighting gameplay. The parts that are added, like the spells, are really enjoyable. But the core of the gameplay, the combos, the dodging, all of it will start getting repetitive once you've spent some hours getting used to it. To start with, not being able to dodge while stuck in some combos animation is a real bother, in a game like that where bosses will punish you a lot. The animations of mixed combos are way to slow to be able to use it when you really need it, because it will either miss the opponents or cost some chunk of life by the time the animation processes. And though you can get some new finishers by spending points in your ability tree, none really feels interesting, they're all kinda slugish.So overall, i definitely can't recommand getting this game for such a high price, because being beautiful and being inovative is not enough nowaday to make a good game. No point in having all of these if the game fails to keep the player in for a whole playthrough. And this come from a guy who usually play the hell out of these kinda of games.",game great enjoy cant recommend asid fact comput start get random issu ever sinc play game yesterday wifi complet shut play game forc reset network card first time year game encount difficulti spike would frustrat player determin game felt fairli easi tiger boss soul veteran boss like go fight mous fight rock giant compar boss next one follow right next kind difficulti without anyth realli fight upgrad characteruntil game pace flow offer craft new armor major boss get new point spend abil tree would expect action rpg dev claim game sudden game becam soul like nowher enjoy soulslik game advertis one cant recommand game actionrpg peopl enjoy difficulti encount wall mid playthroughedit spend hour boss later id say biggest issu game basic fight gameplay part ad like spell realli enjoy core gameplay combo dodg start get repetit youv spent hour get use start abl dodg stuck combo anim real bother game like boss punish lot anim mix combo way slow abl use realli need either miss oppon cost chunk life time anim process though get new finish spend point abil tree none realli feel interest theyr kinda slugishso overal definit cant recommand get game high price beauti inov enough nowaday make good game point game fail keep player whole playthrough come guy usual play hell kinda game

"I AM A SON OF VULKAN AND BY MY HEAVY FLAMER THE HERETICS AND THE XENOS SHALL BE CLEANSED BY THEIR SIN FO EXISTENCE! FOR THE EMPEROR!Edit: For the love of the Emperor, fix the focus enemy function and all the imputs, because I get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up just because the character won't respond to my imputs. I wanna shooty shot the marked enemy, guess what, Titus just stands there and watches.Edit2: The lack of the report button in PVP is mind boggeling. Do you honestly think no one will ever cheat in this game? As Sseth put it: ""Easy Anti-cheat is a very good anti-cheat, because its very easy to turn off"". In almost 30 hours I've encountered at least 10 cheaters and there is no way to report them. If I have to edit this review one more time, I'd have to make it a bad review, and I honestly don't want to, but you give me no choice.Edit3: After finishing the campaign and maxing the wins for the Heavy in PvP, I have to give this game, an overall 5/10. The game looks fantastic, the combat is mid, but satisfying enough to keep you going for more, all the armours and weapons look extraordinary, and the customisation is behind a grind wall and I am rather ok with that since its just cosmetics and no actual gameplay changes (except for multiplayer), but that is about it. This is what I find good in this game.The story is dog water, and its an absolute waste of time, there is no intrigue, there is no stakes, its just under mid-story bits and pieces here and there, the writing is ass, the characters are 1 dimensional (yes, even Titus), the voice acting is better for the Cadians and Imurah than the space marines we play as (even in multiplayer this argument still stands). And what stings the most is the Season Pass. You need to pay 40$ to have the PRIVILEGE to grind your ass off to get the Ultramarine skins. I know they will add more stuff later, but I hope I don't have to buy Season Pass 2 for another 40$ in 2026 just to have the PRIVILEGE of grinding my ass off again. I dont understand this pay-for-more-grind mindset, I understand that the main gameplay will be PvE operations and PvP sop you will always have a lot of currency to use and all that, but in PvE you need to pay the same currency for upgrades that make you more OP. Having to choose between upgrades and customisation should be illegal in this day and age. Not to mention a lose in PvP is like 15 gold and a win is about 25 gold... in 1 hour of PvP you can gain between 90 gold and 150 gold which is enough for 1 chapter unlock, and with dosens of chapters you are asking for hundreds of hours of PvP and PvE just to unlock every customisation possible.I dont mind the default customisation, that is whatever, but the Season Pass is a waste of money, 40$ for 12 ultramarine skins to grind is not worth. Maybe if it was already unlocked then you'd have a maybe, but this is just trash.",son vulkan heavi flamer heret xeno shall cleans sin fo exist emperoredit love emperor fix focu enemi function imput get charact wont respond imput wan na shooti shot mark enemi guess titu stand lack report button pvp mind boggel honestli think one ever cheat game sseth put easi anticheat good anticheat easi turn almost hour ive encount least cheater way report edit review one time id make bad review honestli dont want give finish campaign max win heavi pvp give game overal game look fantast combat mid satisfi enough keep go armour weapon look extraordinari customis behind grind wall rather ok sinc cosmet actual gameplay chang except multiplay find good gameth stori dog water absolut wast time intrigu stake midstori bit piec write ass charact dimension ye even titu voic act better cadian imurah space marin play even multiplay argument still stand sting season pass need pay privileg grind ass get ultramarin skin know add stuff later hope dont buy season pass anoth privileg grind ass dont understand payformoregrind mindset understand main gameplay pve oper pvp sop alway lot currenc use pve need pay currenc upgrad make op choos upgrad customis illeg day age mention lose pvp like gold win gold hour pvp gain gold gold enough chapter unlock dosen chapter ask hundr hour pvp pve unlock everi customis possiblei dont mind default customis whatev season pass wast money ultramarin skin grind worth mayb alreadi unlock youd mayb trash

"2022 The game was rushed to release and that is painfully easy to see not only by all the performance issues and bugs at the release date (even after the delay of the original release date from 2021 to 2022), but also by reading through the Roadmap that was revealed today, in which reflects how poorly the release is actually going when it comes to fixing issues and getting basic content out for players.With the game not being in Early Access or tagged as such, having loyal consumers having to wait at least 6 months just to have what you would call ""staples"" or ""basics"" of the TW Warhammer games such as the Blood DLC pack and the Immortal empires mode (and only a Beta at that time with the final and proper release only at the end of the year in Q4) is truly inexcusable.Update: After one year in ""Early Access"" the game keeps having a lot of unresolved issues and they are getting more greedy and trying to gouge fans as they go you just need to take a look at the upcoming Chaos Dwarves DLC pricing.Just check the new DLC Shadows of Change to be released soon, they keep gouging prices for DLCs that have a low amount of new content with recycled units.Update 2:You know developers and the entire company lost their plot when they are putting official statements to their community with phrases such as: ""The right to discuss is a privilege—it is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game""The only thing I wish is that they start on capitalizing on a massively opportunity for their own IP, ""Total War: Clown Fiesta"" complete with a gazillion overpriced DLCs to compensate for the failure of Hyenas, the ongoing Early AccessTM for Total Warhammer III and copy paste Total War Pharaoh.",game rush releas pain easi see perform issu bug releas date even delay origin releas date also read roadmap reveal today reflect poorli releas actual go come fix issu get basic content playerswith game earli access tag loyal consum wait least month would call stapl basic tw warhamm game blood dlc pack immort empir mode beta time final proper releas end year truli inexcusableupd one year earli access game keep lot unresolv issu get greedi tri goug fan go need take look upcom chao dwarv dlc pricingjust check new dlc shadow chang releas soon keep goug price dlc low amount new content recycl unitsupd know develop entir compani lost plot put offici statement commun phrase right discuss privilegeit entitl earn play gameth thing wish start capit massiv opportun ip total war clown fiesta complet gazillion overpr dlc compens failur hyena ongo earli accesstm total warhamm iii copi past total war pharaoh

"Once Human is a mix between The Secret World and Pal World with camp building mechanics. It is a lot of fun but this is barely past the Beta stage. Still, it's still one of the best F2P games I have seen.Pros:++ Story Line: It's a post-apocalyptic world with a pretty straight forward plot, but there are some good moments in the story.++ Combat: Combat is actually fun, with a lot of different weapons. Players are free to use different types of gear and weapons, so there is plenty of opportunity to experiment and try new ways in combat.++ Graphics: The world is beautiful and diverse, with very detailed models.++ F2P without P2W!: There is a cash shop in this game, but it is for cosmetics. The game itself is far from P2W, with all the gear being in-game. I was very pleasantly surprised at the lack of P2W that usually plagues these types of games.Cons:++ Bugs: This game is Early Access at best. Voice acting fails often, bugs in quests pop up fairly often. That said, the development team is working around the clock to resolve many issues, with numerous fixes being released almost daily.TLDR:I really like this game and it's worth the time that I have invested so far. I hope the devs continue to iron out the bugs and are active in refining the game. Basically, it's a Free to Play relative of The Secret World but with camp mechanics and ""pets.""

"My honour is my life.My duty is my fate.My fear is to fail.My salvation is my reward.My craft is death.My pledge is eternal service.What is there is truely excellent and if you're looking for a satisfying feeling, power fantasy that offers up a surprising amount of difficulty, this is exactly for you.The only disappointment so far (27 hours in) has been how the content does seem to run a bit dry sooner than expected. I expected the game to have a similar lasting power as Left 4 Dead games, that offered short ""Campaigns"", yet it was just fun even repeating the same levels.The problem the ""Operations"" PvE missions seem to face, is that there is no real reason to scour through the corners of the map very well in hopes for something cool or different. Yes, health pickups and the like are valuable, but they don't change the game in ways that different weapon pickups, adrenaline shots, chainsaws, gas canisters, defibrillators etc. seemed to change things up in L4D.The different grenades offer a tiny bit of variation and so do the somewhat randomized enemy encounters, but that's about it in terms of variety. Even the most valuable things, the Armory Data is always(?) in the same spots. With that said, the gameplay loop itself is ridiculously fun and trying to tackle new difficulty levels has been exciting and I don't see myself dropping the game any time soon. But it has left me wishing there was more to discover, rare armor piece finds or.. just a little bit more intrique to level exploration itself.Right now it seems there's a ""meta"" building up that some players only dodgeroll through the level to the objective areas, skipping fighting anything that isn't necessary and I'd say that's a big indication of the levels not being interesting.I don't regret a fully priced purchase however (bought the standard edition, with no season pass and other stuff) and have had a truely fun time with an action game that has me admittedly a little bit addicted.Glad that the devs will be adding things in gradually. :) Hopefully it's concrete enough to offer variety once things start getting too repetitive.",honour lifemi duti fatemi fear failmi salvat rewardmi craft deathmi pledg etern servicewhat trueli excel your look satisfi feel power fantasi offer surpris amount difficulti exactli youth disappoint far hour content seem run bit dri sooner expect expect game similar last power left dead game offer short campaign yet fun even repeat levelsth problem oper pve mission seem face real reason scour corner map well hope someth cool differ ye health pickup like valuabl dont chang game way differ weapon pickup adrenalin shot chainsaw ga canist defibril etc seem chang thing differ grenad offer tini bit variat somewhat random enemi encount that term varieti even valuabl thing armori data alway spot said gameplay loop ridicul fun tri tackl new difficulti level excit dont see drop game time soon left wish discov rare armor piec find littl bit intriqu level explor itselfright seem there meta build player dodgerol level object area skip fight anyth isnt necessari id say that big indic level interestingi dont regret fulli price purchas howev bought standard edit season pass stuff trueli fun time action game admittedli littl bit addictedglad dev ad thing gradual hope concret enough offer varieti thing start get repetit
"The first impression of the game is very good. Haven't seen much yet, 5 hours in, but grafics, controls and combat seem nice. The atmosphere is very good, except for millions of player shacks everywhere, which does ruin the atmosphere quite a bit. They should reduce the number of buildings per world, drastically. The real problem is the monetization, which is completely off. The prices for items to buy is just insane to a point, where we just won't spend a single cent on this game. Instead of having a monthly sub that enables you to get what you want, there are multiple paywalls, even if you get the battlepass or monthly sub. For example they are asking 50€ for a set of walls/doors/windows. This is insane. Not only that 10€ is the absolute maximum this should cost, you should be able to require a set like this, via your monthly sub, plus a few smaller things. Fallout76 didn't do it very well, but even they did it better than Once Human. In fact, items to build your base are a major longterm incentive to keep playing, if you can farm them ingame. Not via a battlepass though, but from dungeons and bosses, even if the drops require a monthly sub.In once Human you got an insane monetization overkill. A battlepass for over 23€. A monthly sub for 5€ and on top structural base sets and character skins for 30€ each, which you don't get via your sub and battlepass. I am sorry, but this is sick and should be boycotted, because this predatory way of monetization is about as demotivating, as your typical p2w mobile game. So unless there will be a reasonably priced monthly sub, which allows for getting one of those structural base sets or character skins plus some smaller furniture items and skins, my gf and I won't spend a single cent on this.Update 20 hours in: The game is twofold. The gaming part is fine. It is pretty much a combination of ""The Secret World"" and ""Fallout 76"" and it does a good job at that. The monetization, however is appalling. You got 2 different subs, a whole bunch of different currencies, gambling mechanics and even with both subs, you don't have it all. This is sick and i suggest not to spend any money in this game, until they come up with something decent and less invasive and greedy. The game is good though. I would gladly pay 15€ per month for a sub, but then i expect full access and no paywalls that require more money. Even the most expensive item or set, should be obtainable via a currency that you get with the monthly sub and no item or set should be more expensive, than the amount of currency, that you get per month from your sub.So while the game is good, it is impossible to recommend, due to the completely appalling monetization. For now though, you can play the game without needing any money. A nice move, but that by no means compensates the sick way, they approach monetization.",first impress game good havent seen much yet hour grafic control combat seem nice atmospher good except million player shack everywher ruin atmospher quit bit reduc number build per world drastic real problem monet complet price item buy insan point wont spend singl cent game instead monthli sub enabl get want multipl paywal even get battlepass monthli sub exampl ask set wallsdoorswindow insan absolut maximum cost abl requir set like via monthli sub plu smaller thing didnt well even better human fact item build base major longterm incent keep play farm ingam via battlepass though dungeon boss even drop requir monthli subin human got insan monet overkil battlepass monthli sub top structur base set charact skin dont get via sub battlepass sorri sick boycot predatori way monet demotiv typic mobil game unless reason price monthli sub allow get one structur base set charact skin plu smaller furnitur item skin gf wont spend singl cent thisupd hour game twofold game part fine pretti much combin secret world fallout good job monet howev appal got differ sub whole bunch differ currenc gambl mechan even sub dont sick suggest spend money game come someth decent less invas greedi game good though would gladli pay per month sub expect full access paywal requir money even expens item set obtain via currenc get monthli sub item set expens amount currenc get per month subso game good imposs recommend due complet appal monet though play game without need money nice move mean compens sick way approach monet

"2022 The game came out and i was completely ready to go and enjoy it. it didn't think that they could go wrong but as it turns out you can take a winning formula and massively mess it up. Where to begin with Major issues:The factions are not fleshed out at all and it feels much more like a minor faction from Rome 1 total war.The old game factions have not had any balancing done so they are terrible and AI simply obliterate them.CA messed with the upkeep on certain factions so the AI ends up a silly number of armies right away and on Leg difficult its just a joke.The base game making you send an army into the realm of chaos every 20ish turns but on higher difficulties you tend to only have a single army so you can go in and have no empire or protect your empire which just sucks as the AI doesn't seem to have this issue at all nearly getting one of the 4 souls each time this happens without fail.Major factions are once again just running roughshod over everything so that update from warhammer 2 to stop that apparently wasn't goods.AI armies are still just flying into your territory and being untouchable and burning cities all over the place STILL.Major power locations are just terrible, Ogre kingdoms are the worst as there isn't really anyone for them to fight so if your not them they always turn into a huge issue. Its either no one around or getting real chummy. Minor issues:Not a great selection of unique buildings locations, feeling abit spares with that even though warhammer 2 just ended putting more and more of these in as it makes locations important rather than ""oh i just lost a city, meh its one of hundreds"".provinces that are just villages, i mean seriously who sat down and decided that people wanted level 3 capped areas?!?!Few updates have been put in but the game still feels like it incomplete and tbh they haven't even touched the sides of the issues this game has so far. 3/10 so far but will update this score as hopefully CA has realised they have delivered a shiny turd.Update after Immortal empires and 1st DLC.Some updates have been made and the chaos factions are now somewhat fleshed out, I feel however this is more things that should have been in the game at release but didn't make it till much later.Older factions have started to get a rework but this varies wildly between the factions and CA seems to be taking the blunt hammer approach to development and simply removing and adding buffs almost at random.Diplomacy is better but the AI still hold a massive player bias and again still march their armies across the map to fight you and only you. CA appear convinced they have fixed this but evidently they haven't.The immortal empires map is very big and has every faction in it and that's its selling point really, kinda wish they still had the realms of chaos in it though, feel that was a step backwards really. The new crisis events are quite interesting and we are seeing more happening with this in each update.Overall I think there has been improvement with the updates but some of the core issues are still flagging up, hopefully with further updates things will continue to improve.

"After finishing the game with 100% of achievements, I can definitely say that the game lives up to the hype and I highly recommend playing this game. Of course, there are a few flaws that I shall mention, but overall I've had a great time playing. It looks amazing, the combat is fun and smooth and the story managed to get me emotional at certain points. My final score for this game is 9/10.Regarding performance, I had to play on medium settings, since I ran the game with an i7-6700 processor, 16 GB RAM and a Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070 graphics card, which is far from ideal. But with the right settings, the game ran smoothly most of the time and even on medium settings it still looks quite good. I've only had one crash on day 1 and a bit of stuttering during the prologue. Other than that, there were no issues. The story takes place after the events from Journey to the West. I won't spoil the events that take place in the game, but at the end of each chapter we get cutscenes related to the story of that chapter, each one being done in a different animation style. Also, there are different endings to the game. The path we follow in the game is, for the most part, quite linear, but it has enough branching paths and secret areas so it doesn't feel boring, or like we are stuck on rails. The environments we explore over the course of the game are quite varied, ranging from forests, deserts, frozen lakes and mountains, labyrinthine caves, volcanic mountains. Regarding exploration, I've seen some people complaining about the lack of a map, but personally I haven't felt lost or like I would have required help orienting myself, perhaps with the exception of the final chapter, that takes place in an open area. My biggest complaint about exploration and navigation is that there are invisible walls (which is understandable, since it's not an open world), but sometimes it's difficult to tell if something is inaccessible or the path to a potential secret area. When in doubt, just bonk all the fences I guess. But other than this, I've had no issues with this part of the game.The game is an Action RPG, with challenging combat (still, it feels a lot easier than a souls-like in my opinion) and plenty of bosses to fight. There are, in fact, over 90 different bosses and mini bosses that we can encounter in the game and they have different looks and move sets (yes, there are few frog bosses that only differ through their elemental type, but even fighting those is worth it in the end), so combat will not get stale. By doing the secret areas in each chapter, you get an item that can make the final boss of said chapter a lot easier. For example, gain flame immunity against the first one, or cancel one of their abilities. Of course acquiring these items and using them is optional, so if you prefer a harder encounter, you still have that option.Regarding combat, it is fluid and responsive, with light/heavy attacks and combos, three stances, transformations and varied spells. The skill tree is generous with its options and re-allocating skill points is free, so experimenting with different builds is encouraged. Stats and resistances can be boosted through alchemy after you meet a certain character and you can reallocate these points whenever you want.Armor sets give certain bonuses which buff various play styles. Equipment progression is mostly linear, at least to a certain point where you gain the option to upgrade older sets of armor, which allows you to continue using the bonuses you prefer. There is only one weapon type, the staff, but there are spears that can be obtained and they have a somewhat different move set.The mini bosses we fight can be absorbed and used in combat, each one gives a passive buff and a brief transformation that executes their signature attack.Now, regarding my main issues with the game... As I've said above, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether you will hit an invisible wall or start down hidden path.Chapter 4 in particular has a lot of secret content that can be accidentally missed, which can be quite frustrating if you are a completionist. The game requires playing through NG+ anyway if you want to 100%, so I guess it's not that much of an issue, but it's still annoying. For example, to unlock the secret area (that contains missable stuff too, of course), you need to fight an optional boss twice. But during the first encounter, that boss can drop a piece of armor that is needed for the achievement. It only drops that item IF you attack it from behind and break 4 of its arms. If you accidentally kill the boss before that, you are unable to obtain the item in that playthrough.And the final complaint, which again matters only if you want to 100%: the drop rates for seeds and armor pieces are a bit too low in my opinion. Sure, it depends on RNG and luck, but I spent 2 full days trying to farm the last type of seed I needed for the [Seed to Sow] achievement. And that is while wearing the items that boost drop rates too. And for this reason alone I give it a 9/10 instead of a 9.5/10 like it would otherwise deserve.",finish game achiev definit say game live hype highli recommend play game cours flaw shall mention overal ive great time play look amaz combat fun smooth stori manag get emot certain point final score game perform play medium set sinc ran game processor gb ram nvidia geforc gtx graphic card far ideal right set game ran smoothli time even medium set still look quit good ive one crash day bit stutter prologu issu stori take place event journey west wont spoil event take place game end chapter get cutscen relat stori chapter one done differ anim style also differ end game path follow game part quit linear enough branch path secret area doesnt feel bore like stuck rail environ explor cours game quit vari rang forest desert frozen lake mountain labyrinthin cave volcan mountain regard explor ive seen peopl complain lack map person havent felt lost like would requir help orient perhap except final chapter take place open area biggest complaint explor navig invis wall understand sinc open world sometim difficult tell someth inaccess path potenti secret area doubt bonk fenc guess ive issu part gameth game action rpg challeng combat still feel lot easier soulslik opinion plenti boss fight fact differ boss mini boss encount game differ look move set ye frog boss differ element type even fight worth end combat get stale secret area chapter get item make final boss said chapter lot easier exampl gain flame immun first one cancel one abil cours acquir item use option prefer harder encount still optionregard combat fluid respons lightheavi attack combo three stanc transform vari spell skill tree gener option realloc skill point free experi differ build encourag stat resist boost alchemi meet certain charact realloc point whenev wantarmor set give certain bonus buff variou play style equip progress mostli linear least certain point gain option upgrad older set armor allow continu use bonus prefer one weapon type staff spear obtain somewhat differ move setth mini boss fight absorb use combat one give passiv buff brief transform execut signatur attacknow regard main issu game ive said sometim difficult tell whether hit invis wall start hidden pathchapt particular lot secret content accident miss quit frustrat completionist game requir play ng anyway want guess much issu still annoy exampl unlock secret area contain missabl stuff cours need fight option boss twice first encount boss drop piec armor need achiev drop item attack behind break arm accident kill boss unabl obtain item playthroughand final complaint matter want drop rate seed armor piec bit low opinion sure depend rng luck spent full day tri farm last type seed need seed sow achiev wear item boost drop rate reason alon give instead like would otherwis deserv

"2017 Rating: good (7/10) Introduction Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a First Person Shooter set in a comptetetive scene where two teams battle for an objective. It is a stand-alone follow-up to the famous Counter-Strike mod from Half-Life where terrorists battle the Counter-Terrorists on different locations. Gameplay & Story: 6/10 The gameplay consists of buying weapons and shooting your opponents. Easier said than done actually, since your opponents are either human players sitting on the other side of the world wide web or some AI programmed to shoot you first. CS:GO is for a reason the biggest competetive shooter on the market for years, since it offers great weapon balance, tactical possibilities for teams to approach and a large player base that keeps growning each day. The story behind the game is based on the oldschool Counter-Strike game, where one side takes the approach as terrorists either trying to plant a bomb or protect the hostages and other being Counter-Terrorists either try to protect a bomb site or trying to rescue the hostages held at Terrorist base. Combat & Challenge : 8/10 The combat is absolutely fluid in CS:GO and there are barely any moments, that you could blame the broken hitboxes or the bad netcode for dying. People tend to rage and blame the bad balance on maps, weapons or programming of the game, however the success of this title proves that it is the best competetive shooter on the market. The challenge in this game is definetely to be able to rise through the ranks in competetive matches, playing against hackers on opposite team or some players on your team that want to teach you some bad words in russian or french. I am always thankful for such opportunities to improve my language skills and consider it just a chance of becoming even better if I did not win the match no matter the team stacks. Reaching Global Elite rank after around 200 hours, I can safely say that it is possible to rise to the top even when the odds are stacking against you. Graphic & Interface : 7/10 The graphic when set to higher settings is actually pretty good, sadly the competetive scene barely allows it since there are certain tricks like setting your resolution lower on purpose to be able to aim better, that crash the feeling of this game in graphical matters. Most of the maps contain some details that make them distinguishable, like certain grapphiti on some maps. The interface is kept simple and almost transparent so that it does not disturb the concentration. Progress & Mini-Games : 8/10 It is possible to consider progress by rising up the account level that comes from simply playing CS:GO in any form, there are forms of rising up your ranking by playing competetive or gathering skins for the weapons you are using or want to sell. Some people actually make money by playing this game and selling the skins on the steam market, so different ways to progress in and outside of the game. The biggest progress for me was improving my hand-to-eye coordination by playing it competetively. Audio & Immersion : 8/10 Each weapon sound is unique for itself, and since the sound plays a great role in this game it is really important to get to know the sounds and be able to distinguish where the shooting is coming from. CS:GO fulfills its task really well. The music is played only in menues and during the highlights. The game music is nothing special, but since you can get/buy music kits to fit your music taste, Valve found a good workaround for not creating amazing music by themselves. Side-Notes This game offers single player, multiplayer and co-op modes that can be played either against other players or AI.This game offers different modes, some of that are just for fun, for example gun mode, while others are played in E-Sports.This game contains steam achievements.This game offers great optimization and updates to technology with time (updating their network code, updating the hit boxes, balancing the weapons). Summary CS:GO has its reasons to be the Number One FPS in the ESL Scene and its popularity is currently only rising. It is great to see that it has not been abandoned by the developers after reaching its peak state, but still keeps getting updated. I would recommend trying CS:GO to every game, just to know what this game is that defines the global FPS market so much and while FPS fans might love it, some might well get turned off by the hardcore players or the cursing and spitting wanna-bes.I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying and installing this game.

"Introduction I completed the game 100% last week (about 60 hours in), I'm on NG+4 and I just recently actually ""completed"" the game as in reaching max level, maxing all the important gear, all the important spirits, I've found every secret there is to be found, and there are still things to do (maxing every spirit/gear, reaching NG+9 which according to some people is where the stats of the enemies actually cap etc). I've tested various builds and pretty much gave everything at my disposal a try, I wanted to do all of this before writing my review.I'll be honest, at first I wanted to give this game a negative review right from the start, reason being that they are lying when it comes to the minimum/recommended system requirements. I have 2 rigs, a 3060 laptop and a 4080 pc, I Installed it first on my laptop and even tho everything on it is above the recommended system settings, I didn't got more than 20-25 FPS in the first area (higher in the other areas), this was with RT off, minimum settings, FSR on 50, on 1080p there's no way a 1060/2060 will handle this game at anything above 15-20 fps in certain areas. But then I installed it on my pc and I decided to play the game to see what the hype is all about.I'll start first with the negatives: - They lie about the system requirements (I would say you would need at least a 3070/4060 to enjoy a decent framerate at 1080p). - The RNG drops in this game can be really really bad (sure this can be ignored if you don't plan on 100% the game, but you will be missing on certain items) - You lack the means to move faster when exploring (you get a transformation near the end of chapter 3 and a spell in chapter 6-don't wanna spoil anything- which allows you to move faster but you can only use them in those chapters, and at first it wasn't so bad but the more you play the game, especially when you're going for 100%, the more you will feel frustrated at your overall slow pace)- The large bosses in this game have janky hitboxes - Some enemy attacks can go through the terrain - The general lack of direction in chapter 6 (the only open world chapter) can be disorienting And this is pretty much all the negatives I can think of.Now lets debunk some common negative criticism this game is receiving:- Combat is basic and boring you only do light attacks and a heavy attack. If you hear anyone saying this know that they haven't played this game for more than an hour and their opinion is irrelevant, either that or they don't have the mental capacity to understand the basic mechanics of the game. You have light & heavy attacks sure, you also have a staff spin attack, thrusts, parry (spell), parry + counter while attacking with heavy if you time it perfectly, dodge, perfect dodge, skills that let you go invisible and counter, immobilize, immobilize + perfect dodge if your timing is perfect, self-buffs, cast clones that later on can do coordinated attacks with you, different stances with different heavy attacks(3 basic ones which you can change at will + 1 secret one), spirits who can do massive one hits, or multiple lower-dmg hits, spirits who can block/dodge, spirits who can heal you, spirits which depending on your current light attack phase can do a different combo of their own, you can apply debuffs (freezing, poisoning, shocking or setting the enemy on fire), you can use vessels to keep your combos going, you have various transformations at your disposal with their own unique weapons and combos. Like you can literally do god-tier almost infinite combos if you know what you're doing and you have the required items, or you can dodge + parry and focus on counter-attacks and massive hits for no-hit runs, or you can literally no-brain it and just go full nuke and one shot pretty much anything even in ng+ while risking to get one-shotted yourself, or you can stack elemental debuffs on your enemies, you can literally play anyway you want. Sure there isn't a lot of weapon variety (you only get staves and spears) but you're playing as wukong.... what did you expect, twinblades?- Game is a boss-rush ... literally no, this game probably has the most amount of unique bosses BY FAR out of all the single player games, they are literally everywhere but that doesn't make it a boss rush games, people who say that either don't understand what that means or they just hate because they wanna hate.Ok, now to the positives: - Graphics + Soundtrack are simply 10/10, UE5 really shines in this game, and the soundtrack is just eargasm- This game has probably the best bosses out of any game ever, the sheer quantity of unique bosses is nothing short of amazing, but to take things to the next level, almost all of the bosses are incredibly fun to play against (except the large ones bc of their janky hitboxes), they offer a good challenge with varying degrees of difficulty, from very easy up to hard or very hard depending on your playstyle, level/items or experience with videogames in general. Its literally a perfect balance between quantity, quality and difficulty.- The story is really good, but what really stood out for me is the way it is presented, not everything is served on a platter, a lot of key information is presented in the form of subtle hits from dialogues (mostly from the secret bosses and quests) & from the animations we get when we finish every chapter. The relationship between various characters in the game is absolutely mind-blowing once you figure it out (small spoilers ahead, some of your enemies are actually your allies, they are brothers who test you and guide you in this game to obtain certain items, access certain areas and become stronger, you have a lover which is never mentioned at any time during the game etc)- The animations from the end of the chapters are god-tier- They stayed true to the source material while managing to add their own twist to the tale of wukong without butchering the material, but instead enhancing it- The combat is really good, if you just figure it out....- No hand-holding. There's no real combat tutorial, no mini-map or map, no quest indicators, no quest journal, the tooltip is very basic, there's a lot of hidden maps, arenas, bosses, items that most people will just miss out. Ofc this can make some people mad at the game saying stuff like the combat is basic because they don't have the capacity of figuring stuff out, but this game lets you explore and figure out everything on your own, which is what a good game should, the experience just hits differently once you figure stuff out on your own and makes the game many times better.- Has great replayability value- Well polished, in my 84 hours of playthrough as of writing this review the only bugs I encountered were some enemy attacks that would phase through walls.- No MTX Final Verdict Overall I give this game a 9.5/10, and I recommend getting this game for yourself however it does come with a buyers beware because they lie about the system requirements, I would say you need at least a 3070/4060 and even then I'm unsure if you're gonna get constant 60+ fps at 1080p, but I guess you can figure this for your own pretty fast and you can always refund.",introduct complet game last week hour im recent actual complet game reach max level max import gear import spirit ive found everi secret found still thing max everi spiritgear reach accord peopl stat enemi actual cap etc ive test variou build pretti much gave everyth dispos tri want write reviewil honest first want give game neg review right start reason lie come minimumrecommend system requir rig laptop pc instal first laptop even tho everyth recommend system set didnt got fp first area higher area rt minimum set fsr there way handl game anyth fp certain area instal pc decid play game see hype aboutil start first neg lie system requir would say would need least enjoy decent framer rng drop game realli realli bad sure ignor dont plan game miss certain item lack mean move faster explor get transform near end chapter spell chapter wan na spoil anyth allow move faster use chapter first wasnt bad play game especi your go feel frustrat overal slow pace larg boss game janki hitbox enemi attack go terrain gener lack direct chapter open world chapter disori pretti much neg think ofnow let debunk common neg critic game receiv combat basic bore light attack heavi attack hear anyon say know havent play game hour opinion irrelev either dont mental capac understand basic mechan game light heavi attack sure also staff spin attack thrust parri spell parri counter attack heavi time perfectli dodg perfect dodg skill let go invis counter immobil immobil perfect dodg time perfect selfbuff cast clone later coordin attack differ stanc differ heavi basic one chang secret one spirit massiv one hit multipl lowerdmg hit spirit blockdodg spirit heal spirit depend current light attack phase differ combo appli debuff freez poison shock set enemi fire use vessel keep combo go variou transform dispos uniqu weapon combo like liter godtier almost infinit combo know your requir item dodg parri focu counterattack massiv hit nohit run liter nobrain go full nuke one shot pretti much anyth even ng risk get oneshot stack element debuff enemi liter play anyway want sure isnt lot weapon varieti get stave spear your play wukong expect twinblad game bossrush liter game probabl amount uniqu boss far singl player game liter everywher doesnt make boss rush game peopl say either dont understand mean hate wan na hateok posit graphic soundtrack simpli realli shine game soundtrack eargasm game probabl best boss game ever sheer quantiti uniqu boss noth short amaz take thing next level almost boss incred fun play except larg one bc janki hitbox offer good challeng vari degre difficulti easi hard hard depend playstyl levelitem experi videogam gener liter perfect balanc quantiti qualiti difficulti stori realli good realli stood way present everyth serv platter lot key inform present form subtl hit dialogu mostli secret boss quest anim get finish everi chapter relationship variou charact game absolut mindblow figur small spoiler ahead enemi actual alli brother test guid game obtain certain item access certain area becom stronger lover never mention time game etc anim end chapter godtier stay true sourc materi manag add twist tale wukong without butcher materi instead enhanc combat realli good figur handhold there real combat tutori minimap map quest indic quest journal tooltip basic there lot hidden map arena boss item peopl miss ofc make peopl mad game say stuff like combat basic dont capac figur stuff game let explor figur everyth good game experi hit differ figur stuff make game mani time better great replay valu well polish hour playthrough write review bug encount enemi attack would phase wall mtx final verdict overal give game recommend get game howev come buyer bewar lie system requir would say need least even im unsur your gon na get constant fp guess figur pretti fast alway refund

"Amazing ARPG which has lots of unique bosses with their own move set, the graphic of this game is top of the line. Combat is definitely fun, and more in line of GOD OF WAR than soul-like games. You would have access to all kinds of spells and transformations, which are fun and very helpful to overcome some of the more challenge bosses. Even thought the map level design definitely has some room for improvement, the overall exploring experience is satisfy. The Lore and story in Wukong is deeply rooted on the original story ""Journey to west"". However for the short animations, side quests, back stories, you can understand just fine with a little bit of reading from the in-game journal. Honestly, it's a gem in this game if you are interesting in Chinese methodology.The short animations are some of the biggest surprises, its a Chinese version of ""Love,death&robot"".

"Product refunded TL;DR: Solo players beware, this is very much a game balanced and intended to be played with a group despite having the option of Solo. If you have at least 1 friend you can bring with you i'm sure the experience is 1000x more enjoyable and fun, otherwise i would stay away until they announce significant improvements to the AI. Be aware there are no private lobbies either until later this month it seems, so no way of doing operations solo either at the moment. I can't speak for Anything PVP as i have no interest in that.Rant Below:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I wanted to like this game...I Really REALLY wanted to like this game... Warhammer is very cool and i was looking forward to this for months...Hell the game looks good, seemed well optimized, and i'm sure is such a blast with friends as everyone is saying...But the current status of solo play is ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS!!! AI Companion behavior is as follows:- They Do Not Help with the objective.- They Do Not Kill a noticeable amount of enemies at all, often just peppering various enemies before swinging wildly.- They often stray far from Titus and waste time with random fodder in the distance- Likewise if you are doing an objective and require defense they will NEVER BOTHER TO DEFEND YOU! - They have a habit of leaving executable enemies alive (This is supposed to let the player come over to gain some armor and is always done when the player is below 100% armor, but when i'm like 40+ feet away thanks to their behavior and still dealing with all the active mobs this can get VERY ANNOYING to deal with as you can imagine.- They do not draw aggro from the horde AT ALL!!!! Even if they are in front of titus they often just get skipped over, leaving the ENTIRE SWARM DESIGNED FOR 3 SEPARATE PEOPLE!!! all for the player to deal with.Literally Their sole purpose at this time is to come and revive you when you get downed thanks to them not doing ANYTHING ELSE!!!! And by the way, you have limited revives so have fun seeing the same checkpoint over and over. At least you don't have to backtrack much.This is by far one of the WORST Companion AI's I have seen in a PvE game. Even with this price tag and all the hype behind it I was never gonna expect them to create something that could feel like a legit fill-in for a player but WOW this is just ridiculous! They really are THAT bad.... Keep in mind that this is on veteran difficulty, which the game states is the Intended difficulty. Yes, yes I know I can just lower the difficulty to absurdly easy levels and probably 1 tap everything myself and try to stick to listening to the story. But gameplay was like 85% of the reason i picked the game up. The story, while i'm sure interesting enough for groups pushing through the game , is simply not gripping enough to warrant neither slowly dragging my feet through hordes of easy creatures with no challenge Nor Play the intended difficulty or higher and suffer with the two basically non-existent AI allies. The bosses themselves also seem to be intended as a challenge to deal with, would have been fun to at least see them and take a good try at them but sucks I wont get around to them thanks to dying due to lack of defense, being swarmed and just generally left for dead by the companions.One thing to note is that the developers are the same people who created the World War Z game, Seemingly Notorious for its own AI also being awful...Hmmm....At that point as someone who has zero interest in modern PVP games/modes, and doesn't wanna get kicked out of lobbies constantly nor generally leave how much fun I can have up to randoms in said lobby, I ultimately bailed.Private lobbies are coming later this month it seems, which should probably allow solo in operations but with the dev's poor AI record from the WWZ game and of course only 6 PvE missions to pick from at the moment, it really doesn't bode well. I WANT to be proven wrong so badly, I want the experience to become smoother regardless of how many play. But this is just NOT IT right now. Definitely not for 90 bucks at least. I would hope that their top priority is adjusting the AI but considering this is being treated as a primarily multiplayer game currently, i'm not gonna hold my breath for it.I leave it to you whether or not its worth 60 bucks, I mean there are many (cheaper) games that offer more significantly more playtime but assuming you dabble in the PVP and Don't get tired of doing the 6 missions over and over you could probably squeeze 30+ hours or more depending on when you finally get tired of it.As for me? I think the foundation is there, but there is much to be improved and it really sucks we aren't getting a proper replayable PvE horde mode until a year in. Oh Well...If they make the improvements to the companions and reviews start glowing about it I will go back and switch it to positive. Hell, if they are SIGNIFICANTLY better maybe i'll even pick it up and try again at some point...but until then I leave very disappointed for now.",product refund tldr solo player bewar much game balanc intend play group despit option solo least friend bring im sure experi enjoy fun otherwis would stay away announc signific improv ai awar privat lobbi either later month seem way oper solo either moment cant speak anyth pvp interest thatrant belowi want like gamei realli realli want like game warhamm cool look forward monthshel game look good seem well optim im sure blast friend everyon sayingbut current statu solo play absolut atroci ai companion behavior follow help object kill notic amount enemi often pepper variou enemi swing wildli often stray far titu wast time random fodder distanc likewis object requir defens never bother defend habit leav execut enemi aliv suppos let player come gain armor alway done player armor im like feet away thank behavior still deal activ mob get annoy deal imagin draw aggro hord even front titu often get skip leav entir swarm design separ peopl player deal withliter sole purpos time come reviv get down thank anyth els way limit reviv fun see checkpoint least dont backtrack muchthi far one worst companion ai seen pve game even price tag hype behind never gon na expect creat someth could feel like legit fillin player wow ridicul realli bad keep mind veteran difficulti game state intend difficulti ye ye know lower difficulti absurdli easi level probabl tap everyth tri stick listen stori gameplay like reason pick game stori im sure interest enough group push game simpli grip enough warrant neither slowli drag feet hord easi creatur challeng play intend difficulti higher suffer two basic nonexist ai alli boss also seem intend challeng deal would fun least see take good tri suck wont get around thank die due lack defens swarm gener left dead companionson thing note develop peopl creat world war z game seemingli notori ai also awfulhmmmat point someon zero interest modern pvp gamesmod doesnt wan na get kick lobbi constantli gener leav much fun random said lobbi ultim bailedpriv lobbi come later month seem probabl allow solo oper dev poor ai record wwz game cours pve mission pick moment realli doesnt bode well want proven wrong badli want experi becom smoother regardless mani play right definit buck least would hope top prioriti adjust ai consid treat primarili multiplay game current im gon na hold breath iti leav whether worth buck mean mani cheaper game offer significantli playtim assum dabbl pvp dont get tire mission could probabl squeez hour depend final get tire ita think foundat much improv realli suck arent get proper replay pve hord mode year oh wellif make improv companion review start glow go back switch posit hell significantli better mayb ill even pick tri pointbut leav disappoint

"After really taking my time with this game, I can't ignore that while it starts super strong, it all kinda falls apart in the second half. By the time you hit chapter 4, the narrative starts to lose coherency unless you're a diehard journey to the west scholar, any sense of creative fight design is out the window and replaced by scammy gimmicks designed to nerf your progression and force you into basic play where your only tools are dodges and light attacks, and it's so riddled with minor bugs that while you can play mostly unperturbed, any extra exploration or effort towards 100% will inevitably slam you with a bugged quest line or boss fight. It's just straight up sloppy for a game presenting itself as a AAA experience, Ubisoft finishes their games better than this, and that's saying something. It's hard to say don't buy this game since the first half is so strong, but if you're on the fence, my best advice is wait for some patches.",realli take time game cant ignor start super strong kinda fall apart second half time hit chapter narr start lose coher unless your diehard journey west scholar sens creativ fight design window replac scammi gimmick design nerf progress forc basic play tool dodg light attack riddl minor bug play mostli unperturb extra explor effort toward inevit slam bug quest line boss fight straight sloppi game present aaa experi ubisoft finish game better that say someth hard say dont buy game sinc first half strong your fenc best advic wait patch
"Worthwhile MMO-like Survival Gameplay for FreeEnjoy it now, at least until this NetEase-owned Chinese developer decides to make it P2W or drops development in the future, as they've done with a lot of their games. Only time will tell. That said, OnceHuman right now is an awesome survival game. It's sort of an MMO cross between Nightingale and Left 4 Dead. You can create hives or warbands to play together with your guild/clan, or you can just play solo and still have a ton of fun.Servers seem pretty reliable right now, and I'm playing with my gaming community that's more EU-based, while I live in NA. The EU servers are still fairly responsive for me. That's a huge plus. I've been impressed in that I've experienced absolutely no rubber-banding, stutter, or hiccups... yet. I have played with a few others around, but no massive parties or groups yet.And I'm impressed with the game's performance. I run at 2k on a gaming rig from 2016/2017 with a GTX 1080, so I wasn't expecting any sort of good performance. I turned down AA, shadows, and set VFX to medium. It runs very smooth with a 60Hz Vsync at 2k resolution on my system. Kudos to the devs for having the game perform this well at launch.As for gameplay, I was only planning on playing for an hour since I had other things to do on launch day. But I couldn't stop playing and ended up foregoing all of my other tasks to play this all evening long. It's really enjoyable and addictive. That's coming from a rather grumpy gamer who's very choosy about what I play. Progression in the beginning (first two tiers) seems balanced and doesn't feel like a grind. I'm not sure if that will become more of a grind or not over time.Controls are intuitive, but key bindings need more work. I'm ok with F for interactions, but I usually remap things like roll/dodge to Q or E. Shift for sprint is nice, but haven't bothered to find a way to toggle it on/off yet (not sure if that's possible?). Sprinting reduces your stamina(?) meter which is shared with mining and chopping down trees, so I'm not a fan of that. And being able to craft vehicles and explore while driving around is fun, but gas usage really needs to be turned down quite a bit.I love the post-apocalyptic feel of the game and the environment, along with looting junk to deconstruct for basic components/materials. Some mobs are very easy to fight while others are a bit annoying (e.g.: flying mobs are a pain). And I don't really see the need for base defensive structures yet, as nothing is attacking my base. May be these are for later progression or PVP? I'm playing on a PVE server, so as long as you don't do chaos, you don't have to worry about PVP. On PVP servers they're only PVP once you hit level 10.Constructing your base is fairly straight-forward, but sometimes orienting pieces to fit is painful. Fortunately they have a ""fly"" mode where you can move about freely to make placement easier. Still, some fitment of pieces is restricted when it shouldn't be, but most things work well together and handle edge overlap just fine. The first roofing you get is fugly, but it gets better later. Also, it's not good to give absolutely no lighting options early on, as interiors can get quite dark, even with windows.There was a 14 minute queue just to login to your selected server on launch day, and that's even before you get to create and customize your character (and that customization is insane for its amazing level of detail). Hopefully that queue wait will improve, especially since my server was only listed as a ""Mid"" population server. The servers are just numbers with PVE or PVP prefix, so it's rather dull to tell your guild/clan/gaming community you're on server PVE01-000XX. It would be nice it servers were not split into regions, but global with regional yet seamless zones. Picking regional servers is so 2000s to 2010s.The intro video was very vague and did a horrible job (no job at all) in providing a back story to the current world and state of things. And it only gets worse from there, as there's nothing explaining the reason for moving in and out of different realities/plans of existence/whatever. All of these terms including deviant, star dust, star fall, rifts, etc. is just terminology stolen from other IP that don't seem to have any special back story or meaning in the game. And apparently you collect, nourish, and equip some sort of magical/ethereal butterflies to help you along the way, all while getting advice from a holographic/pseudo-real talking bird that's visually annoying. But the most frustrating, immersion-breaking aspect is that your character replied to NPCs during dialogs with no speech but feigned head movements and gestures even though the NPCs are speaking with decent audio clips.To sum it up: no story, weird dialogs, and sloppy, disjointed explanation of your purpose. But the gameplay is addictive and fun. Both network and game client performance is excellent. No P2W (yet?), and developers are on top of addressing feedback and complaints (like giving us the ability to create more than one character now). This is a Chinese developer with a poor history of P2W and abandoning games, along with a questionable privacy policy, but that can be overlooked with the way things have progressed in Once Human so far.

"I wish there was an option ""Recommended for 40k Fans""Short review: Do I recommend the game? Yes. But to people who are interested in Warhammer 40k. And not the expensive editions, just buy the regular one.Long review: I loved the first Space Marine, actually, I beat it last week for the first time in anticipation for the sequel.Space Marine 2 leaves you in awe of how amazing the environments look. The hordes are stunning and give you the ""oh shi-"" feeling when you realize that the hundreds of Tyranids running towards you aren't some backdrop but the actual enemies you'll have to fight.Some gameplay mechanics are questionable. Executions now replenish armor instead of health unlike in the first game, this makes sense from a Co-Op point of view but in the campaign it really pulls you out of the moment and frustrates you. In fact, if you fully die, you just restart from the previous checkpoint with reset to your ""downed"" limit. Which means that if you got into a boss fight with just ""down"" left, it's better to just let the boss kill you to restart the fight with a reset ""down"" count.I'm also not a fan of the limited weapon slots. In the previous game you had your pistol, your primary and two other slots for big guns. In this game, you have your pistol, your primary, and an occasional big gun which you can pick up but have to drop if you want to switch to the others. This left me wishing I had picked another gun as my primary before specific boss fights.There were very few bugs, and I had encountered only 1 soft block during a mission, but luckily I had a checkpoint right before so I reloaded and didn't lose any progress. Checkpoints in this game are very generously provided.The game is great for 40k fans, but some of the gameplay mechanics make it frustrating to play on the higher difficulties. I played on the ""Veteran"" difficulty which is the second highest and the intended one by the devs, and I do wonder if people were even more frustrated with the highest difficulty.Tl;Dr: Space Marine 2 is a great game for 40k fans but will likely leave non-fans frustrated due to a handful of gameplay design choices that really piss you off. Only the standard edition is worth it, don't waste your money.",wish option recommend fansshort review recommend game ye peopl interest warhamm expens edit buy regular onelong review love first space marin actual beat last week first time anticip sequelspac marin leav awe amaz environ look hord stun give oh shi feel realiz hundr tyranid run toward arent backdrop actual enemi youll fightsom gameplay mechan question execut replenish armor instead health unlik first game make sens coop point view campaign realli pull moment frustrat fact fulli die restart previou checkpoint reset down limit mean got boss fight left better let boss kill restart fight reset countim also fan limit weapon slot previou game pistol primari two slot big gun game pistol primari occasion big gun pick drop want switch other left wish pick anoth gun primari specif boss fightsther bug encount soft block mission luckili checkpoint right reload didnt lose progress checkpoint game gener providedth game great fan gameplay mechan make frustrat play higher difficulti play veteran difficulti second highest intend one dev wonder peopl even frustrat highest difficultytldr space marin great game fan like leav nonfan frustrat due hand gameplay design choic realli piss standard edit worth dont wast money

"2022 Lots of people seem to be having performance issues, but so far I've had none, and the game hasn't crashed yet despite my intense alt-tabbing.CA are actively addressing performance issues on their page, and have suggested some fixes so far, although idk if they work since I didn't need them. I don't blame people for leaving bad reviews if they think the game is unplayable in its current state, but know this:CA has, as far as I'm aware at least, ALWAYS fixed these sorts of issues, and they've usually been fairly quick about it. It has more or less been like this with every total war game since shogun 2. If you look past all of this, they've done a lot of work to improve the gameplay aspects. Siege battles are actually fun now. Large fortresses themed after the faction who holds it. Sieging Black Fortress as the ogres was some of the most fun I've had in a total war game so far. The AI seems to be more intelligent, especially in battles, and some of the tactics I used in warhammer II don't seem to trick the AI anymore. The new mechanics regarding war targets and ally warfare are very cool, and the diplomacy system UI is overhauled too, and is pretty neat. The loading between the turns is actually surprisingly fast (for me at least), as opposed to when I started playing Warhammer II and each new turn press would be like 20-30 seconds of loading.",lot peopl seem perform issu far ive none game hasnt crash yet despit intens alttabbingca activ address perform issu page suggest fix far although idk work sinc didnt need dont blame peopl leav bad review think game unplay current state know thisca far im awar least alway fix sort issu theyv usual fairli quick less like everi total war game sinc shogun look past theyv done lot work improv gameplay aspect sieg battl actual fun larg fortress theme faction hold sieg black fortress ogr fun ive total war game far ai seem intellig especi battl tactic use warhamm ii dont seem trick ai anymor new mechan regard war target alli warfar cool diplomaci system ui overhaul pretti neat load turn actual surprisingli fast least oppos start play warhamm ii new turn press would like second load
"2013 Really good game. Very simple, yet complex at the same time. For first time players: DO NOT let the game's recoil mechanics scare you away. It will take some time to get used to but once you do, it is a great game.PROS: [+]-Great community (COMPARED TO SOME OTHER GAMES)-Frequent updates-Tradable stuff-Source Engine means that players from GMod, CS 1.6/Source, etc. won't (or at least shouldn't) have a hard time adapting to new controls and physics.-VERY Competitive at higher levels-Tons of workshop files and tons of room to make your own skins and maps-Weapon skins -Multiple modes for casual or competitive and more-High FPS on almost any PC (great optimization)CONS: [-]-Skins can be expensive or worthless-Skins and cases can suck the money out of you if you let it-Recoil is not very easy to get used to-No aiming down sights (FOR NEW PEOPLE, CALM DOWN VETS)-Cooldowns can be handed out unfairly-Low graphic quality/detail compared to other games (IT IS SOURCE, CALM DOWN)-MP only (if you are reading this, you most likely have internet at home, THERE IS A BOTS ONLY OPTION)-Hackers do like to hack in competitive matches at higher levels-Callouts are not that easy to learn for beginnersOVERALL:Get it. If it is on sale, CS:GO is an even better deal. The recoil was my biggest challenge at the start but just take some time to practice with bots.

"2023 new update is extremely frustrating. Been stuck on turn 8 of a campaign for almost 2 hours trying to get the numerous crashes to resolve so I can get on with my campaign. After I finally managed to get through everything, went to save to not lose my progress, and the game crashed again. I give up. Please do not launch broken, buggy updates. Nothing turns someone off a game faster than loading it up and constantly crashing.Update: The game runs worse if anything after several fixes. Now can not even load the game. Attempting to load the game hard locks my PC and forces me to full restart my PC. 100 hours into the game and its become completely unplayable at this point. Not even sure I could politely voice my thoughts at this point, but suffice to say, in short, I would not recommend this game to anyone, unless they like playing russian roulette with their expensive hardware.Not the staff's fault, I'm sure they were time crunched to hell and back to get this released, but maybe some execs need a reality check on what drives customer satisfaction",new updat extrem frustrat stuck turn campaign almost hour tri get numer crash resolv get campaign final manag get everyth went save lose progress game crash give pleas launch broken buggi updat noth turn someon game faster load constantli crashingupd game run wors anyth sever fix even load game attempt load game hard lock pc forc full restart pc hour game becom complet unplay point even sure could polit voic thought point suffic say short would recommend game anyon unless like play russian roulett expens hardwarenot staff fault im sure time crunch hell back get releas mayb exec need realiti check drive custom satisfact

Russian ones.Fine let's list off the bad things: The Matchmaking system is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke Ranks only boost the egos of idiots and many people who're actually decent can't play with their friends because they're stick in ELO hell A lot of boosters, cheaters or not it's amazing to play a game in gn4 and get your ass handed by 4 AFKs and 1 guy with 4k hrs Skins are a quality meme Banning servers for ""malicious plugins"" eg. skin changers is kind of hypocritical considering there's loopholes AND considering there's tons of undetected skin changers and it's not that hard to make one either... VAC is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke, the only thing it CAN ban is Ayyware ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from 2015. 64 Tick servers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, especially if you consider that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CS 1.6 a game that's nearly 2 DECADES OLD had 100+ tick servers (Mainly cause they weren't ran by autists like valve) Weapon spread / inaccuracy is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke the way it's setup (Not Recoil.) Lower ranks are harder to play than higher ones because of smurfs.. (Maybe with the exception of LEM, Supreme and Global) After a bazillion case updates, you still can't start a local server without using casual then changing all the settings. The netcode of the interpolation is on par with Payday 2. Their server utility still says BETA Sprays.... Because everyone loves spending 2 bucks to get a spray they won't like amirite? The cancer inducing community, myself included. If you buy it to play with friends, worry not, your friends won't queue with you because they're too butthurt about their rank Smoke grenade not exploding in fire bug, still not fixed If you want to rank up you need to always 4 or 5 man queue with people who're really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good because there's a good 97% chance of a cheater.

"This is my first big reviewWhere should I start ? The game is literally awesome, I didn't find any single thing, which would bother me or make the gameplay bad.Building:It is simple, I love how you can easily move whole house into new place and you won't lose single thing. For actual release there is also a lot furniture, materials and walls and I believe they will add a lot more.I also love, how you can simply move the object if you place it wrong, or for example chest, you can move it simply with stuff.EDIT:In higher locations it is sometimes bit hard to place something because there are many ores and trees nearby, so you just need to clear them first in order to buildCombat:It is fun, little bit mix of Ghost Reacon and Resident Evil from the camera view and movement. There could be more weapons tho. Finishers are perfect and also the brutality from weapon damage is more than satisfying for horror open world game, just it wants bit more weapons or more unique finishers.Crafting and Material Gathering:For starter players bit confusing, but after some time, you will see it is pretty simple, just need to mine a lot of materials for start, also I like how there is progressing. You can't just mine high tier materials with basic tools, so you need to literally play and put effort into it, but it will reward you. Huge +Deviants:Many many unique deviants, for combat and territory. Many of them are cute many are terrifying, but it makes also good effort to track and gain so many of them. Pretty simple to understand them and also pretty simple to use them.Monsters:I can't say how many monster is there exactly, because I didn't really get that far yet, but I met many interesting mini bosses and mimics which took my breath away. Just the zombies from beginning are bit too repetitive since it is your basic enemy, but I am fine with that. Hope they will add also more terrifying monstersServers:Sometimes it there is little lag, sometimes it just lags more due a rendering, but I would say it is stableCosmetics:There is not much of it, but for the starter items they look really awesome and wonderful! I must admit, that they were cooking with the cosmetics. I am ready to give them my wallet, you can also find some in open world by looting if you are lucky enoughWorld Events:These events are pretty original and I can say I didn't saw them in any other games, also the co-op with other players during those events just brings so many good vibes (if I count only PvE servers where can't kill you unless you are in event PvP zone - only find one event with PvP).Vehicles:stock tier is ''paper'' you can destroy them easily, but if we say it will be made by reality, I won't say a word. Upgrading it on tier 2 will make significant difference You can simply tune your vehicle if you have enough materials and use cosmetics for it as well. There could be something like tune garage exactly, when you can customize it as you want, just if there gotta be little detail, which someone gonna hate, so he can simply remove it through that modification. Would be great if they add something like this.Skill tree:can't say a word, perfection and for co-op with friends it is even better, but after ranking up and progressing into higher tiers, it is starting to be a lot difficult to obtain new skills because it cost more, so you need to find a way to farm energy points easily for skill tree (bosses, side quests, journey tasks and more)Note:Only thing I found as missing from my perspective, when I was playing with my friend and our another friend wanted join, we couldn't drop him weapon or gear, I didn't even find they way how to drop it. normal stuff like drinks, food, tools you can drop, but you can't drop any weapon and armor.My final Review:Would I recommend this game ?

"+Fantastic set pieces, some boss fights are simply sublime hitting all the right notes for a truly memorable epic encounter.+Amazing art direction with very unique world / characters.+Absolute Cinema, Wukong probably delivers the best showpieces ever featured in a video game.+Top notch visuals and presentation.+Memorable and high quality soundtrack.+Very well paced considering the game is massive, packed with content, there's plenty of secrets and it never fails to surprise as each chapter advances. It feels very satisfying to progress as you play.+Amazing intros and outros for each chapter, you'll see for yourself.-Environments may be pretty but there's too much empty spaces with obtuse level design resulting in poorly rewarded exploration, there's a lot of empty spaces that serves no purpose besides making an area looking bigger. Also, some frustrating placement of invisible walls, which is kinda funny bc it looks like they didn't know where to close some areas using the environment (using walls, rocks, trees, etc) leading to some badly placed invisibile walls but they also went nuts with widening ground space in a game with slow traversal, stamina consumption while running and mostly populated with uninteresting loot. I feel like the game simply shines brighter when it's focused with tightly designed levels, for example chapter 2's wasteland felt like a slog and in chapter 3 you'll get bored to death with the snow section and the frozen enemies. Chapter 1 and 4 felt so much better to play. -Skill tree unlockables are underwhelming. Skill variety is great but the upgrades are kinda boring.-Story will probably hit you as nonsensical if you know nothing about Journey to the West.-Game kinda fails to properly communicate some system mechanics stuff to the player in the long run.-Visual clues in combat is very lacking at times, sometimes it looks like the enemy was just moving a limb or itself around with its animation but actually it was an poorly visually communicated attack and you'll get hit by it. I also feel like sometimes the aim for a ""realistic accurate"" illumination can lead to bad visual clarity in combat, that happens a lot while exploring some places outside of boss fights.-The camera can be very clunky while fighting in tight spaces or not helpful at all while taking on multiple enemies engaging at once.-Just a personal opinion but I think being able to more openly cancel attacks would do wonders to open up the combat fun factor (specially the base light combo that you'll be using all the time throughout the whole game). The light attack flurry gets old pretty fast and you'll be using it a lot. Unlocking the spear mid game felt like a bit of fresh air just by the sole fact that it changes the basic light attacks animation.It takes inspiration from Souls titles but leans a lot more into ""character action games"" when it comes to combat, that may turn off some closed-minded people who expected this to be the next closest thing to a From Software game made by another studio. Actually Wukong is a thing of its own, not really a Soulslike, it feels more like a character action game with RPG elements, what I mean by that is you'll steal your turns in combat with multiple tools available instead of waiting, feels more like a grounded Bayonetta / Devil May Cry / God of War instead of a Dark Souls approach to the method. Plus, you lose nothing upon dying. On the other hand exploration and traversal feels pretty much like a Souls title but lacking the finesse that you'll find in From Software games, at least most of the time.Game is great overall, but it feels kinda unpolished at times with its systems / combat and very lacking in level design, but yeah it looks pretty af with grandiose set pieces and a respectfully creative art direction with some truly amazing boss fights. Still, very impressive for a studio first output, its leagues above what most western developers are trying to do in the AAA gaming space.It's refreshing to see a triple A single player title thriving so well in a sea of disconnected live service games flopping hard while trying to be the next Fortnite / Overwatch 1 or whatever, especially coming from a brand new studio, despite some flaws this is the good stuff, highly recommended.",fantast set piec boss fight simpli sublim hit right note truli memor epic encounteramaz art direct uniqu world charactersabsolut cinema wukong probabl deliv best showpiec ever featur video gametop notch visual presentationmemor high qualiti soundtrackveri well pace consid game massiv pack content there plenti secret never fail surpris chapter advanc feel satisfi progress playamaz intro outro chapter youll see yourselfenviron may pretti there much empti space obtus level design result poorli reward explor there lot empti space serv purpos besid make area look bigger also frustrat placement invis wall kinda funni bc look like didnt know close area use environ use wall rock tree etc lead badli place invisibil wall also went nut widen ground space game slow travers stamina consumpt run mostli popul uninterest loot feel like game simpli shine brighter focus tightli design level exampl chapter wasteland felt like slog chapter youll get bore death snow section frozen enemi chapter felt much better play skill tree unlock underwhelm skill varieti great upgrad kinda boringstori probabl hit nonsens know noth journey westgam kinda fail properli commun system mechan stuff player long runvisu clue combat lack time sometim look like enemi move limb around anim actual poorli visual commun attack youll get hit also feel like sometim aim realist accur illumin lead bad visual clariti combat happen lot explor place outsid boss fightsth camera clunki fight tight space help take multipl enemi engag oncejust person opinion think abl openli cancel attack would wonder open combat fun factor special base light combo youll use time throughout whole game light attack flurri get old pretti fast youll use lot unlock spear mid game felt like bit fresh air sole fact chang basic light attack animationit take inspir soul titl lean lot charact action game come combat may turn closedmind peopl expect next closest thing softwar game made anoth studio actual wukong thing realli soulslik feel like charact action game rpg element mean youll steal turn combat multipl tool avail instead wait feel like ground bayonetta devil may cri god war instead dark soul approach method plu lose noth upon die hand explor travers feel pretti much like soul titl lack finess youll find softwar game least timegam great overal feel kinda unpolish time system combat lack level design yeah look pretti af grandios set piec respect creativ art direct truli amaz boss fight still impress studio first output leagu western develop tri aaa game spaceit refresh see tripl singl player titl thrive well sea disconnect live servic game flop hard tri next fortnit overwatch whatev especi come brand new studio despit flaw good stuff highli recommend

"2022 Short version:Pros:+ Amazing world-building and lore+ Stellar locations and landmarks brimming with enemies and wildlife+ Exploration feels rewarding+ Responsive and satisfying combat+ Outstanding amount of content+ Tons of replay value+ Epic soundtrack+ Superb visuals+ Splendid voice acting+ Challenging boss fightsCons:- Limited, janky co-op play- Horse combat could be better“Long” version:Elden Ring is an RPG developed by FromSoftware Inc and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It is an ambitious game that attempts to bring the Dark Souls formula to an open world setting.I really enjoyed Dark Souls I and III but I was never the sort of person to pre-order any of them and would always wait for a massive sale. With Elden Ring, I remember watching the reveal trailer and thinking it was not for me because of the huge open world. I have grown tired of the Ubisoft open-world formula so I lost my interest immediately. Fortunately, some gameplay videos came out and they looked glorious so I decided to give it a try.Turns out it ended up being one of my favorite games of all time!Just like other FromSoftware’s titles, Elden Ring’s approach to story is interesting.You play as a Tarnished on a quest to become the Elden Lord. You get introduced to some events and characters on your journey and must rely on side missions, item descriptions and character dialogue to know more about this world. This might discourage some players, but I found the whole setting and story to be epic. Holy... That looks stunning! A Screenshot of ELDEN RING By: Good Guy Nick Elden Ring’s gameplay is great.The core gameplay loop has remained untouched – you go from checkpoint to checkpoint (called sites of grace in this game), disposing of enemies on the way, earning runes (currency) and allocating them to numerous stats that increase a plethora of things like HP, mana, stamina, immunities, etc.If you die, you lose all your runes and must go back to pick them up. If you die before getting to them, however, they are gone for good. Every time you rest at a site of grace, all your healing/mana items come back but all enemies respawn too.Exploration feels way better than before, as you now have a responsive, dedicated jump button. Additionally, you can now ride a swift and nimble horse named Torrent to quickly travel through the huge open world.Plentiful sites of grace, where you can rest and level up, also allow you to quick travel with ease.Exploring further but also revisiting areas is always encouraged, as there are always useful items and gear just around the corner.Combat has also received a facelift.It feels more responsive and fine-tuned. You still have a myriad of options when it comes to weapons, armor and other trinkets.You can focus on swords, whips, staves, crossbows, shields, you name it… These have their standard attacks but also activated abilities that add versatility into the mix. The sheer amount of personalization present here is awesome. You can pick from an absurd amount of armor and talismans, mixing and matching with different sorts of weapons. The options for weapon/gear combos are endless.Enemies are as relentless as ever and feel super satisfying to slay. Some might feel impossible to beat but there is always something you can do – a different approach you can take, a different weapon, maybe coming back after you are more experienced.There is always something to do in Elden Ring. The open world nature of the game allows you to visit whichever area you desire. This might end up killing you, but you might also find a new weapon or upgrade materials to make yourself strong. This might be a double-edged sword for some players. Personality, I loved it. I managed to find a spot that had considerably easy opponent to beat that were worth a lot of runes. After a few visits to that area, I managed to level up a great deal of times and felt quite overpowered for a good portion of the story mode. Thankfully, a lot of the side quests and bosses put me back in my place by killing me repeatedly. ELDEN RING A Screenshot of ELDEN RING By: Good Guy Nick There are two more aspects of gameplay I must touch on and I will start off with horseback combat.Mounted combat is fine, but I feel like it could be better. I have been told by friends that it really depends on what kind of weapon you are carrying and that makes sense, but, at the same time, the camera can get in the way if you lock onto targets and the whole combat aspect always feels a bit janky and unsatisfying. You can certainly cheese a few bosses while riding Torrent and you will get more skilled as you become more experienced, but I do not think it is as enjoyable as regular combat.The final feature I want to mention is online co-op. It is present, but I think it has been poorly implemented. Summoning other players might not always work, as I had trouble finding my friend. When we finally got to play together, the summoned player would always return to their world after someone dies or after defeating a boss. I can see why some people enjoy this but I would have loved to be able to complete the story with a friend and not being sent back every time we kill something.Furthermore, you are bound to a single location while playing co-op, as the game summons walls of fog to prevent you from going to other areas. You cannot ride your horse either, which is very unfortunate.You could say it is due to technical limitations but, in this day and age, I do not think that is the case.It is not a deal-breaker, obviously, I actually prefer playing these games on my own, for the most part – but adventuring in such an epic world with a friend, employing different strategies to overcome amazing bosses sounds terrific and you only get a small portion of that, which is very disappointing.Invasions serve as the PvP component of Elden Ring and these are fine. They do not happen too often and you can disable them entirely, which is nice. The game also includes some story-driven invasions that give you an extra challenge to face. ELDEN RING A Screenshot of ELDEN RING By: Good Guy Nick I always say that Dark Souls game do not have great graphics but feature stellar art direction. Well, in Elden Ring , the graphics are absolutely stunning and the art direction is flawless. Environments are distinct and masterfully exude feelings of beauty, peace, rot and desperation; sometimes, at the same time. Really, I spent so much of my playtime just taking in the gorgeous vistas. It is art.Sound design is up next. Another win, in my opinion.Sound effects are amazing - hits feel visceral and impactful and ambient noises make the world feel lived-in. It is beautiful.Voice acting is top-notch. Every single delivery is spectacular and Elden Ring actually made me care about the fate of a few NPCs, something that never happened in any of the Dark Souls games. I will protect Roderika, Hewg, Miriel and Sellen with my life.The soundtrack is immaculate - there is something so thrilling about crossing a wall of fog and coming face to face with a towering monster while epic music plays. It really hypes you up and gives this grandiose feeling to the whole experience.So, yeah… I am a big fan of Elden Ring.I want to play it, even as I write this review. I played it for 100+ hours on my first week with it and I cannot wait to start a new playthrough!It is an easy recommendation that will give you tons of high-quality content. It fixes the problems I have had with the open-world genre by offering a map filled with objectives that do not feel grindy. The gameplay is great, the visuals are breathtaking and its sense of scale is of legendary proportions.Final score: 9.5 out of 10.If you enjoyed this review, please consider following my curator page.",short versionpro amaz worldbuild lore stellar locat landmark brim enemi wildlif explor feel reward respons satisfi combat outstand amount content ton replay valu epic soundtrack superb visual splendid voic act challeng boss fightscon limit janki coop play hors combat could betterlong versionelden ring rpg develop fromsoftwar inc publish bandai namco entertain ambiti game attempt bring dark soul formula open world settingi realli enjoy dark soul iii never sort person preorder would alway wait massiv sale elden ring rememb watch reveal trailer think huge open world grown tire ubisoft openworld formula lost interest immedi fortun gameplay video came look gloriou decid give tryturn end one favorit game timejust like fromsoftwar titl elden ring approach stori interestingy play tarnish quest becom elden lord get introduc event charact journey must reli side mission item descript charact dialogu know world might discourag player found whole set stori epic holi look stun screenshot elden ring good guy nick elden ring gameplay greatth core gameplay loop remain untouch go checkpoint checkpoint call site grace game dispos enemi way earn rune currenc alloc numer stat increas plethora thing like hp mana stamina immun etcif die lose rune must go back pick die get howev gone good everi time rest site grace healingmana item come back enemi respawn tooexplor feel way better respons dedic jump button addit ride swift nimbl hors name torrent quickli travel huge open worldplenti site grace rest level also allow quick travel easeexplor also revisit area alway encourag alway use item gear around cornercombat also receiv faceliftit feel respons finetun still myriad option come weapon armor trinketsy focu sword whip stave crossbow shield name standard attack also activ abil add versatil mix sheer amount person present awesom pick absurd amount armor talisman mix match differ sort weapon option weapongear combo endlessenemi relentless ever feel super satisfi slay might feel imposs beat alway someth differ approach take differ weapon mayb come back experiencedther alway someth elden ring open world natur game allow visit whichev area desir might end kill might also find new weapon upgrad materi make strong might doubleedg sword player person love manag find spot consider easi oppon beat worth lot rune visit area manag level great deal time felt quit overpow good portion stori mode thank lot side quest boss put back place kill repeatedli elden ring screenshot elden ring good guy nick two aspect gameplay must touch start horseback combatmount combat fine feel like could better told friend realli depend kind weapon carri make sens time camera get way lock onto target whole combat aspect alway feel bit janki unsatisfi certainli chees boss ride torrent get skill becom experienc think enjoy regular combatth final featur want mention onlin coop present think poorli implement summon player might alway work troubl find friend final got play togeth summon player would alway return world someon die defeat boss see peopl enjoy would love abl complet stori friend sent back everi time kill somethingfurthermor bound singl locat play coop game summon wall fog prevent go area ride hors either unfortunatey could say due technic limit day age think caseit dealbreak obvious actual prefer play game part adventur epic world friend employ differ strategi overcom amaz boss sound terrif get small portion disappointinginvas serv pvp compon elden ring fine happen often disabl entir nice game also includ storydriven invas give extra challeng face elden ring screenshot elden ring good guy nick alway say dark soul game great graphic featur stellar art direct well elden ring graphic absolut stun art direct flawless environ distinct master exud feel beauti peac rot desper sometim time realli spent much playtim take gorgeou vista artsound design next anoth win opinionsound effect amaz hit feel viscer impact ambient nois make world feel livedin beautifulvoic act topnotch everi singl deliveri spectacular elden ring actual made care fate npc someth never happen dark soul game protect roderika hewg miriel sellen lifeth soundtrack immacul someth thrill cross wall fog come face face tower monster epic music play realli hype give grandios feel whole experienceso yeah big fan elden ringi want play even write review play hour first week wait start new playthroughit easi recommend give ton highqual content fix problem openworld genr offer map fill object feel grindi gameplay great visual breathtak sens scale legendari proportionsfin score enjoy review pleas consid follow curat page
"2023 Greed but shortsighted, go and suck your MAMA CA.",greed shortsight go suck mama ca
"Story 6/10I love games with solid stories. This game is based on the Chinese mythological story called ""Journey to the west"". I actually spoke to many Chinese people about this to see if they knew it, and every one of them did. It seems to be a massive story, and I have no doubt that this game done a great job of showing it, but to someone who is not Chinese, I had a hard time telling what was happening. It was good from what I had understood but I didn't really understand most of it. I couldn't relate to why certain events were happening. That said, I do like Chinese mythology. I knew some of the characters in this such as Erlang Shen, and Sun Wukong, obviously. I also saw a scene with Ne Zha and some others and I liked this, even though I didn't know what was happening.Controls 9/10These types of games usually have clunky control systems, but actually this was very smooth to play. Default controls were perfect, and it never felt unnatural to use any of it. Camera views were never really an issue either. I think I have an issue at one point in the game. There was a certain boss on the last chapter. It had multiple hit boxes and for some reason the game automatically switched the hitbox I was looking at . It was quite frustrating having to keep taking it off and on again.Mechanics 9/10The main way of attacking is through your staff. Melee attacks are straight forward. Your different stances do change things up a little bit, but not much. Very simple to learn. Spells add a nice addition to combat. You don't have to use them, but they do change the play style of a bit. To be honest, I didn't even use that many of them. Certain ones just suited my play style more. You have a big selection of transformations as well, which also nicely plays in with Wukong's lore of having many transformations. Each one provides a different play style on limited time. The healing in game was the only frustrating part. It takes sooooo long to use a heal. I understand this plays into the difficulty, but when bosses are so aggressive you really can't get a moment to finish the healing animation sometimes.Graphics 9/10This was simply beautiful. It might be one of the best looking games out there. It's the only time my PC hasn't ran a game at full specs. There was one issue with it. The game requires 16GB ram as a minimum, but this is also the required amount. I have 16GB and I'm going to say that you need more than this. The game literally uses all 16GB. In chapter 3 you will get some frame drops in certain areas, and for this reason I'm going to have to take a point off it.Audio 10/10The audio is what you expect; really good. Each area has it's atmosphere filled perfectly with the audio. There are audio cues in game, and you might not think about them at first, but they're letting you know something is nearby. It didn't even pick up on that until my second play-through. You can dodge enemy attacks by listening to the audio as well.Difficulty and design 8/10I call these types of games the ""git gud"" games. You can't just push your way through them. It is difficult. Some bosses really didn't seem that bad, but you let your guard down and then you get a boss that just kills you so much. There was one boss on chapter 2 that I died to around 30 times I'm sure. Stay level headed and you'll beat it. You can play with a passive play style or aggressive. Both play styles will be better against different bosses.Overall 8/10This game was very enjoyable. I managed to 100% it on play through 3. Some bosses were frustrating but there was no point where I wasn't enjoying myself. From start to finish I just had such a great time playing this. Can't wait for the DLC to come.",stori love game solid stori game base chines mytholog stori call journey west actual spoke mani chines peopl see knew everi one seem massiv stori doubt game done great job show someon chines hard time tell happen good understood didnt realli understand couldnt relat certain event happen said like chines mytholog knew charact erlang shen sun wukong obvious also saw scene ne zha other like even though didnt know happeningcontrol type game usual clunki control system actual smooth play default control perfect never felt unnatur use camera view never realli issu either think issu one point game certain boss last chapter multipl hit box reason game automat switch hitbox look quit frustrat keep take againmechan main way attack staff mele attack straight forward differ stanc chang thing littl bit much simpl learn spell add nice addit combat dont use chang play style bit honest didnt even use mani certain one suit play style big select transform well also nice play wukong lore mani transform one provid differ play style limit time heal game frustrat part take sooooo long use heal understand play difficulti boss aggress realli cant get moment finish heal anim sometimesgraph simpli beauti might one best look game time pc hasnt ran game full spec one issu game requir ram minimum also requir amount im go say need game liter use chapter get frame drop certain area reason im go take point itaudio audio expect realli good area atmospher fill perfectli audio audio cue game might think first theyr let know someth nearbi didnt even pick second playthrough dodg enemi attack listen audio welldifficulti design call type game git gud game cant push way difficult boss realli didnt seem bad let guard get boss kill much one boss chapter die around time im sure stay level head youll beat play passiv play style aggress play style better differ bossesoveral game enjoy manag play boss frustrat point wasnt enjoy start finish great time play cant wait dlc come
"Good: production values are through the roof, love the presentation, music, vo, anims, all fire stuffReally Bad: playing solo campaign on veteran and can barely get through any set pieces without dying 100 times and is not skill issue. They did not play their own game to see that combat, while looking great, is derpy afWill talk about it on core, i hope they see this or hear it, I really like this game but the combat makes it hard to love. will edit review and switch to thumbs up once combat is fixed but I'm super tilted by the sloppy combat in this game. 1) getting pummeled at range while having no cover sucks and we’re no dodge ninjas. Range damage should be hella lowered. I'm busy dealing with the problem in CQC. if they wanna pepper me while i'm in there -- fine. If they improve the health return mechanic maybe its less of an issue, but its just not fun getting peppered relentlessly while I'm in a scrum. I realize it maybe more realistic, but is video game who cares.2) parry need to cancel current action and take priority over all other moves (except executes aka glory kills), and it needs to be generous with direction and timing. We have hoards of dudes crawling into our butts. It may not be realistic but it feels good video game wise — doom 2016 and eternal does this super well with glory kills. Doesn’t matter if I’m reloading or scratching my nuts I press glory kill and I glory kill. Executes already does this in game, parries should do this as well 3) I find myself parrying even if there is no blue circle. Let parries just work — like Arkham games. the number of times a sword guy does an non-blue non-red attack and I parry only for the game to derp and I get hit anyway is massively aggravating. I could have been spamming attack, but when I spam attack, there's a blue circle and I'm in an attack anim and can't parry. This isn't some fighting game where misreads are punished. Let the players parry. The animations looks sick for it I want to spam the parry-gun shot follow up all freakin day man.4) The game only lets you self heal on glory kill when you have white health. White health lasts like 0.000001 seconds. Get rid of white health, it's dumb. All executes should just self heal. This will let us tank the range damage we're getting pummelled by when we are in a melee scrum. Medkits can then and should be saved for ranged encounters (where executes aren't available).5) Armor is weird and makes little sense. Make it one bar or just get rid of it. I don't remember needing it in SM1 and I'm not even sure what is does except go away quickly and never come back. 6) mission set pieces seem to be designed for 3 players… a) set piece mechanic b) hordes of melee c) ranged minions. In solo, I can’t use 3 different weapons at the same time. Example is the rat fight -- I can't shoot the flame thrower, the ranged drones, and the damn sword guys all at the same time. The moment I swap to plasma gun/sword the rat turbines trip me on to the ground and do 1000000 damage. like did you need play these missions solo and go ""man sure seems like some cheap ♥♥♥♥ players will love this""7) exacerbating this problem is the number of times I see ai teammates just standing there, or take a few pot shots at a baby tyrannid while a set piece mission objective is going up in smoke made me put down the game. Again, during rat missions there are drones that need to be taken out, and rats to keep at bay. Since the AI can't be bothered to use the flamethrower, I gotta keep rats at bay. What are my AI buddies doing? Shooting rats. Either make them be more effective at helping or make the set piece stuff make sense for solo play.I actually love a lot about this game and want to play it more but combat and poor combat encounter design leaves too much to be desired right now and the game is frustrating.",good product valu roof love present music vo anim fire stuffreal bad play solo campaign veteran bare get set piec without die time skill issu play game see combat look great derpi afwil talk core hope see hear realli like game combat make hard love edit review switch thumb combat fix im super tilt sloppi combat game get pummel rang cover suck dodg ninja rang damag hella lower im busi deal problem cqc wan na pepper im fine improv health return mechan mayb less issu fun get pepper relentlessli im scrum realiz mayb realist video game parri need cancel current action take prioriti move except execut aka glori kill need gener direct time hoard dude crawl butt may realist feel good video game wise doom etern super well glori kill doesnt matter im reload scratch nut press glori kill glori kill execut alreadi game parri well find parri even blue circl let parri work like arkham game number time sword guy nonblu nonr attack parri game derp get hit anyway massiv aggrav could spam attack spam attack there blue circl im attack anim cant parri isnt fight game misread punish let player parri anim look sick want spam parrygun shot follow freakin day game let self heal glori kill white health white health last like second get rid white health dumb execut self heal let us tank rang damag get pummel mele scrum medkit save rang encount execut arent armor weird make littl sens make one bar get rid dont rememb need im even sure except go away quickli never come back mission set piec seem design player set piec mechan b hord mele c rang minion solo cant use differ weapon time exampl rat fight cant shoot flame thrower rang drone damn sword guy time moment swap plasma gunsword rat turbin trip ground damag like need play mission solo go man sure seem like cheap player love exacerb problem number time see ai teammat stand take pot shot babi tyrannid set piec mission object go smoke made put game rat mission drone need taken rat keep bay sinc ai cant bother use flamethrow got ta keep rat bay ai buddi shoot rat either make effect help make set piec stuff make sens solo playi actual love lot game want play combat poor combat encount design leav much desir right game frustrat

"The campaign is amazing. It captures the 40k universe amazingly well and really feels like you could be in the boots of an space marine. It feels good and has good weight to each action. The grittiness and darkness of this universe is shown so well.The online is where the game falls off a lot. If you're hoping for some super engrossing PvP combat, look somewhere else:There are two versions of online. Co-Op PvE, and PvP.The co-op PvE is pretty good. I like how it's integrated with the main campaign, so that was a smart decision and feels like you're still seeing parts of the campaign even after you've finished it. Very cool way to do that. Unfortunately there are only 6 missions, but more are promised to be added via the season pass.The PvP though, is where things start to get bad. It's obviously not a focus of the game, and feels very tacked on, but it's still a thing. If you're going into this game wanting to focus on PvP, I feel like you're going to be disappointed.- Lack of maps. I think there are 3? 4? Hopefully more to come with the season pass.- Lack of game modes. Standard team deathmatch, a mode with three points you try to control to earn points, and another mode with one point that rotates you have to control for points. That's it. Again, hopefully more to come with the season pass?- Lack of balance. I'm not even sure how to approach this. Between bulwark's that are invincible due to their shield (there are ways around it, but come on, it's massively OP), and a class that stunlocks by grappling you, it gets frustrating fairly quickly.- Corner-advantage. Look, I get it it's a 3rd person game, but it's really annoying to be killed around a corner by someone that I can't even see even though I'm looking in their direction. They can see me, but I can't see them.All in all, definitely get the game for the campaign and play through that. It has a decent length, and each mission is pretty long. The PvE portions of this game are great. the PvP portions are not. For the PvE alone I'd say it's recommended, but maybe when it's on sale.",campaign amaz captur univers amazingli well realli feel like could boot space marin feel good good weight action gritti dark univers shown wellth onlin game fall lot your hope super engross pvp combat look somewher elsether two version onlin coop pve pvpthe coop pve pretti good like integr main campaign smart decis feel like your still see part campaign even youv finish cool way unfortun mission promis ad via season passth pvp though thing start get bad obvious focu game feel tack still thing your go game want focu pvp feel like your go disappoint lack map think hope come season pass lack game mode standard team deathmatch mode three point tri control earn point anoth mode one point rotat control point that hope come season pass lack balanc im even sure approach bulwark invinc due shield way around come massiv op class stunlock grappl get frustrat fairli quickli corneradvantag look get person game realli annoy kill around corner someon cant even see even though im look direct see cant see themal definit get game campaign play decent length mission pretti long pve portion game great pvp portion pve alon id say recommend mayb sale

"Very addictive, there is a ton of things to do. Despite being primarily a shooter (which I usually steer away from) it has elements of an MMO with the addition of open world base building.You can see tons of players, their homes, vehicles and it really makes the game feel alive. There are guilds, dungeons with bosses (some have really fun mechanics), big and small events on the map that require big groups, an absolute ton of decorations, styles and furniture for your home (including plushies!). You can farm crops and flowers, go fishing and cook.There are some bugs and issues that have to be addressed but so far I'm enjoying this game so much I'd recommend it to everyone, even if it's just to build a base, farm decorations and create the greatest farm ever with all the veggies and flowers :DEdit: Phases 1 and 2 were a ton of fun and content to unlock/look forward to.

"2022 + huge amount of content and big world+ variability in playing style+ a large number of weapons / spells / special abilities / items+ leveldesign+ weapons customization options+ terrain goat and its abilities- recycling from past souls games as well as itself- hitboxes and inconsistent processing of damage to between npcs- low inventions, almost all procedures and elements are known from previous gamesElden Ring is an old famous Souls game in the open world. All the good and bad qualities of souls games came together in this great game, just souls replaced by runes, the protagonist is tarnished and not ashen, again the world is a lack of words and normal existence, and story can be ignored by the player. The player has the ability to destroy dozens of species with a plethora of weapons and fighting styles, this time with a large number of spells, special weapon abilities, using summoned ashen helpers or NPCs or coop friends. Bosses are on bog numbers and sometimes they repeat and combine, but the game fails to work with multiple players, and any summon makes it much easier to advance.The world is fascinating, the areas are well designed, but this time within the big world, more recycling with repetitive places or their building blocks.There is not much news, probably the largest creature similar to mountain goat, on which the main character rides and finally jumping. The player no longer stops 30cm boulder and jumping has also become a significant element in the level design. Respawns are really well-placed this time around, although there are a few annoying exceptions.It's a pity that not many inventions took place within the leveldesign, ladders, doors and elevators were basically enhanced with teleports, maybe next time will be nice some kind of interaction with the environment other than the destruction of the junk all around.Exploration is satisfactory, the player can easily get lost, but the map helps with orientation and the ability to insert marks into it, the possibility of teleportation to any ""fire"" is from the beginning of the game.From Software has brought a really good game, which will be enjoyed most by those who have never played their game and everything will be new and fascinating for them.

"Alright, there's some problems here.This game relies almost entirely on dodging, using lock-down abilities, or temporary invulnerable states. If you don't like the Elden Ring mystery delay on all attacks, this probably isn't for you. The Monkey King hits like a wet noodle, leaving most high health enemy fights a boring HP sponge-fest. The lock-down abilities, largely the 'stun', is nice, but is one of the few reliable ways to ensure you do damage. The temporary invulnerable state you unlock early is incredibly underwhelming. Guides indicate the damage is significant, but even once the status effects are triggered, it does little to add to the fight except giving you an extra health bar.Many boss fights devolve into slapping at them to build your meter, stunning, then releasing a one button damage attack.Spirits, in case those interest you, are largely useless and forgettable save for their passive buffs. Well, less than useless, as using double trigger input to execute them is hit or miss. The issues with controls are something else altogether (i'm looking at you type b controls that sometimes just spin your weapon instead of sprinting).The enemies in the levels do nothing to prepare you for the upcoming boss. They are completely unrelated. You will not have an advantage learning how to deal with enemy attacks in the level, as each boss has nothing to do with any of the enemies encountered. In fact, except farming them for experience, you can just run right by them. Additionally there is an enormous gap between enemy difficulty and boss difficulty. You can just spam a simple attack to get through the enemies in the level, but you are punished for the same thing on bosses.Most consumables are very easy to miss. Granted, most do not matter at all until later in the game, but even post-boss loot is a small, slightly twinkling container that contains very useful items. Being that there is no map at all, it can be hard to remember where anything is, or backtrack to search for missed items.Also, don't expect much in the way of explanation. Though things do unlock as you progress, there are mechanics whose importance is understated, which often lead to boring attack patterns. Your main mechanic for damage is to wet noodle spam until you build up 'two dots' on your 'stance icon' (which is poorly explained), then charge the attack and release, or just hit it once if they are stunned. Except for spending an exorbitant amount of time memorizing boss patterns, the only time you reliably hit these charged attacks is with your stun, which has a long cool down and limited uses.The graphics are incredible, the item descriptions include fun stories somewhat related to abilities, and I really want to like this game.The truth is that I keep quitting, then reloading, which for me is a bad sign. If your mechanics are poorly implemented enough for me to leave the game in frustration, what exactly, aside for money invested, is encouraging me to play the game? It's like any other game that is close to greatness, but stumbles with execution. I throw myself against bosses multiple times and do not find any noticeable reason why I won this time, and lost several times previously. It feels like rolling dice. You only need to play against the wandering wight a few times, encounter his three-part slam attack to understand why this is troubling.Wait for this one to go on sale. If you don't like Elden-Ring-esque dodge or die mechanics, you will probably end up just as frustrated as me.",alright there problem herethi game reli almost entir dodg use lockdown abil temporari invulner state dont like elden ring mysteri delay attack probabl isnt monkey king hit like wet noodl leav high health enemi fight bore hp spongefest lockdown abil larg stun nice one reliabl way ensur damag temporari invulner state unlock earli incred underwhelm guid indic damag signific even statu effect trigger littl add fight except give extra health barmani boss fight devolv slap build meter stun releas one button damag attackspirit case interest larg useless forgett save passiv buff well less useless use doubl trigger input execut hit miss issu control someth els altogeth im look type b control sometim spin weapon instead sprintingth enemi level noth prepar upcom boss complet unrel advantag learn deal enemi attack level boss noth enemi encount fact except farm experi run right addit enorm gap enemi difficulti boss difficulti spam simpl attack get enemi level punish thing bossesmost consum easi miss grant matter later game even postboss loot small slightli twinkl contain contain use item map hard rememb anyth backtrack search miss itemsalso dont expect much way explan though thing unlock progress mechan whose import underst often lead bore attack pattern main mechan damag wet noodl spam build two dot stanc icon poorli explain charg attack releas hit stun except spend exorbit amount time memor boss pattern time reliabl hit charg attack stun long cool limit usesth graphic incred item descript includ fun stori somewhat relat abil realli want like gameth truth keep quit reload bad sign mechan poorli implement enough leav game frustrat exactli asid money invest encourag play game like game close great stumbl execut throw boss multipl time find notic reason time lost sever time previous feel like roll dice need play wander wight time encount threepart slam attack understand troublingwait one go sale dont like eldenringesqu dodg die mechan probabl end frustrat

"SummaryCampaign: <15 hours of loreful hack n slash fun. PvE: Fun with friends, but undercooked, linear and clunkyPvP: Fun with friends, but bare bones and unbalanced I recently replayed Space Marine 1, and the sequel is a much better game. The visuals, sound and feel are all spot on for a Space Marine fantasy. However, it doesn't quite achieve everything it sets out to, and its secondary modes fall short of other similar games. CampaignThis is very much a 40k story, with writing reminiscent of a black library novel. That is both good and bad, with the over the top sclock, bravado, action and machismo you'd expect. The grim reality of the Imperium is acknowledged, but on the whole it leans closer to glorification than critique. The gameplay is a continuation of the first game's mechanics and feel, with chainswords and plasma guns feeling suitably impactful. It is highly linear, without meaningful choice and very little exploration. Being combat oriented and straight to the point is very Astartes, but would have grown wearisome if the campaign were any longer. The scripted executions are similarly timed to stay interesting right up to the end of the campaign, but perhaps not much longer.There are obvious missed opportunities here. Like the vehicle levels which have placeholder cutscenes but don't let you control them, or terrain destruction which happens all around you, but you can't actually change. its also quite short, at under ten hours if you race through, or perhaps 15 if you take your time and play the optional missions as they unlock.Still, overall it is an enjoyable romp over a couple of days PvE This is the bulk of the end game replayability, and the customisation will please many tabletop fans. However it has some key limitations. It doesn't have the visual depth or gunplay of Darktide, nor the endless variety and replayability of Vermintide or Left for Dead. This is a much more linear experience where you replay the same maps over and over. You do get variety from the different classes and upgrades, but progression is largely cosmetic or minor stat buffs. Beyond the limited number of maps, skills and enemies, there are also pretty limited number of weapons, with quite a few slots having only a single option. You're likely to get dozens of hours of fun here, but maybe not hundreds. The repetition of things like execution animations which started to show in the campaign will become very clear over repeated play throughs of these levels. There is a roadmap with more content, lets hope there is enough in the pipeline to keep the juices flowing.PvP This is a throwback to a different kind of multiplayer, back to the days of unreal tournament or halo at a LAN party. There is a very low time to kill, and strong reliance on team coordination. There are only three maps with three game modes, so the replayability here is again limited by content availability. PvP will be fun to play at launch, and if you have a crew together, but may struggle to drag people away from the hero shooters and mobas of the world long term. ConclusionThis is a fun and brutal distraction for a few dozen hours. For some it will be a realisation of their childhood fantasy, for others it will be a gateway into an addiction they didn't know they wanted. It is a great entry into the set of warhammer games, and a worthy sequel to a fun game. It won't revolutionise the industry, but it does show that going back to basics and delivering what the fans want is a sound strategy for a good time.",summarycampaign hour lore hack n slash fun pve fun friend undercook linear clunkypvp fun friend bare bone unbalanc recent replay space marin sequel much better game visual sound feel spot space marin fantasi howev doesnt quit achiev everyth set secondari mode fall short similar game campaignthi much stori write reminisc black librari novel good bad top sclock bravado action machismo youd expect grim realiti imperium acknowledg whole lean closer glorif critiqu gameplay continu first game mechan feel chainsword plasma gun feel suitabl impact highli linear without meaning choic littl explor combat orient straight point astart would grown wearisom campaign longer script execut similarli time stay interest right end campaign perhap much longerther obviou miss opportun like vehicl level placehold cutscen dont let control terrain destruct happen around cant actual chang also quit short ten hour race perhap take time play option mission unlockstil overal enjoy romp coupl day pve bulk end game replay customis pleas mani tabletop fan howev key limit doesnt visual depth gunplay darktid endless varieti replay vermintid left dead much linear experi replay map get varieti differ class upgrad progress larg cosmet minor stat buff beyond limit number map skill enemi also pretti limit number weapon quit slot singl option your like get dozen hour fun mayb hundr repetit thing like execut anim start show campaign becom clear repeat play through level roadmap content let hope enough pipelin keep juic flowingpvp throwback differ kind multiplay back day unreal tournament halo lan parti low time kill strong relianc team coordin three map three game mode replay limit content avail pvp fun play launch crew togeth may struggl drag peopl away hero shooter moba world long term conclusionthi fun brutal distract dozen hour realis childhood fantasi other gateway addict didnt know want great entri set warhamm game worthi sequel fun game wont revolutionis industri show go back basic deliv fan want sound strategi good time

"2022 Well, now that I've beaten it exactly at 100 hours over the span of 3-4 weeks I think I can give a penny for my thoughts. Elden Ring is great, the scope of the the world is expansive and daring for Fromsoft to challenge in comparison to their previous games. I'd say they nailed it, the world is pretty fun to find yourself wandering about and finding meaningful content that such as loot, quests, lore, etc.Of course if you're not an open-world fan I can see this still being a game that you'd be reluctant about playing, however I'd say give it a shot if you can and see it for what it is like. There are various ways of tackling Elden Ring, you can spend your time exploring and getting more stronger and making things more accessible or you can choose tackle only the Legacy Dungeons (areas that are more traditional to the Souls games) and enjoy it that way. Any and every way you choose to tackle Elden Ring are all valid, don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.There's also PvP which I've only done a few hours doing and well, it's a mixed experience for me, especially with players spamming the same build (Moonveil or Rivers of Blood katanas) at Soul Level 150. But perhaps you can find a better experience than me with PvP later on as more people experiment more with builds.The game also has some glaring issues, performance most of all being the worst offender even after the patches. I'm running a rig quite above the recommended setting and the game loves to dip frames below half of what it's capped at (being 60). It gets incredibly frustrating when your fighting a boss then your frames decide to tank making you vulnerable to hits and possibly ending your run. Doesn't happen often but when it happens it's noticeable. Another thing I'd have to say is a pain in ass is the camera, there are many times where'd you have to fight the damn camera since it loves to adjust automatically, especially when you're fighting giant bosses on Torrent (your mount). It's very frustrating and was not an issue in the previous Fromsoft games (DS3, Bloodborne) because it WAS a setting you can TURN OFF.Aside from these two main issues I have with the game (which are fixable), I think it's a very enjoyable game and a good entry-point for newcomers to the Fromsoft Souls games. Definitely worth $60 if you've got the rig for it.

"I really do think this game has something for everyoneIf you're someone who enjoys competitive play, there's pvp and high-difficulty events. If you're someone who enjoys exploration and resource collecting, this game rewards curiosity and its inventory management system is so much better than all the other ""gritty"" survival games I've seen. If you're someone who likes base building and low-stress tasks, you can stay at home, refine things, and support friends who go out raidingThe worldbuilding is excellent. I love the mechanisms in the game (the deviations, world events). I really appreciate how the game doesn't waste your time arbitrarily (those mmos which are all ""run here. talk to this person. carry letter to next person. fetch item from chest. give to next person""? why)I also love their pricing model. Unlike many games which focus on making basic gameplay annoying to get you to pay for stamina/carrying capacity/materials, this game is perfectly playable at baseline and allows you to pay for cosmetics + higher-level items. You can buy things to flex or buy things just because they're cool, but they don't feel predatoryThis game does have some areas they could improve. It's very resource-intensive and causes your pc fans to kick into high gear. There are lag spikes occasionally (though they really are not bad) and the game will sometimes take several minutes to load you into the world for seemingly no reason. Some menus should be optimised more (ex: you can't click to refill the salt in your meat dehydrator - you have to manually select the right number). Building is a little clunky. Getting your items placed properly is a bit of a struggleBut? Those are small issues, tbhOverall, I've been having a tonne of fun in this game and I can't wait to experience more.

"2022 Despite the serious issues I have with WH3, I will recommend this game.This is an early review, thus this might change later on, but right now the game is barely in a releaseable state. Keep in mind: Total War Releases are often messy, but at least the Total War Warhammer Games were patched and improved a lot.My current main issues with the game:1. Performance/ Look: For me the game looks worse than WH2, because the campaign barely runs with 30FPS on Medium Settings. My PC that can run WH2 campaign on Very High Graphics Settings with a an average of 54 FPS. This is a pitty as textures are constantly popping up during battles, the campaign map is an blurry pudding.2. Minor and Major Settlement battles are not (yet) enjoyable: AI and unit path finding in settlement battles is horrible, the units are constantly not moving (entities are running into each other or are getting stuck in walls etc.). Your own units are constantly changing the paths, because a barricade was built somewhere (not even on their path). Furthermore, your units tend to take corners as sharp as possible resulting in them blobbing up at corners and beeing super slow. Therefore, it takes a lot of micro management just to move your troops around town and still takes ages for them to arrive anywhere. This is made even worse by the messy camera: it is constantly obstructed by buildings, bridges, towers or what ever and doesn't handle the height differences to well. Oh, and avoiding the dockable areas as the defender is also sometimes tricky, as their zones are too large",despit seriou issu recommend gamethi earli review thu might chang later right game bare releas state keep mind total war releas often messi least total war warhamm game patch improv lotmi current main issu perform look game look wors campaign bare run medium set pc run campaign high graphic set averag fp pitti textur constantli pop battl campaign map blurri minor major settlement battl yet enjoy ai unit path find settlement battl horribl unit constantli move entiti run get stuck wall etc unit constantli chang path barricad built somewher even path furthermor unit tend take corner sharp possibl result blob corner bee super slow therefor take lot micro manag move troop around town still take age arriv anywher made even wors messi camera constantli obstruct build bridg tower ever doesnt handl height differ well oh avoid dockabl area defend also sometim tricki zone larg

"2022 I played through all the campaigns of each 'race' once including Greasus for the Ogre Kingdoms DLC. I refused to try Skarbrand since there is no blood or gore in a game with a LL and faction dedicated to the Chaos God of Blood and Skulls. The game is closer to a mod overhaul than a sequel to WH2, and anyone claiming it is unfair to compare them is how we got the DoW 3 debacle. As far as technical issues it ran fine. My machine had 0 issues. It really is a mess on every level though. There are talents for Nurgle for example that are literally copy pasted, and others that do not work or even worse, the Slaanesh one that disables bonuses from all other sources for diplomacy - effectively killing half the mechanics for that faction. Kislev is a major disappointment and it is readily apparent all the work and effort went into Katarin and Kostaltyn was an afterthought, who is as barebones as an Empire General. Ignoring the flanderisation of ice and bears literally everywhere there are mods that fix this and return bardiche axed streltsi etc. Ironically the ice school of magic is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The Tempest one has a few standouts and is better overall but still weaker. Bears are probably the strongest Cav in the game right now maybe even more so than other warhammer faction and this is a certainty with Boris buffing them. The other 3 Cav units of Kislev are pointless. Elemental Bear is a single target only, huge missile sponge monster and sucks. Had the most fun after unlocking Boris and swapping my campaign to him so that I could ignore the reputation race. Also not being the prime target from all sides by literally everyone not human was a better campaign.Cathay on the other hand is far more fleshed out and overall has mostly useful units at all tiers. The terracotta warriors would be good but their size and flashy animations means they usually miss whatever they are trying to hit anyway. Miao buffed Cathay artillery is the best of any warhammer faction including the dwarves. The added bonus of the hot air balloon fire rocket battery having more ammo than Imperial Rockets of the Empire and damage and a better position in all situation to fire from is obvious power creep. Cathay still needs work. DLC's might flesh it out if the game lives long enough to get any.Tzeentch was super strong and fun until they nerfed barriers due to MP complaints and now his armies are just super squishy skirmishers without the speed to accomplish it. Tzeentch magic is super powerful though. Not that anyone can even experience it since the major faction battle mechanic involving generating winds of magic literally does not work. You press the button the visual effects go off but nothing actually happens. In SP or MP or custom battles. Did not stop CA nerfing it.Nurgle needs work. His cauldron is less than half the interaction and effects of Groms' and the randomness of application is not only unloreful and closer to tzeentch - but is functionally worthless. The most viable way to play him is to group everything up and slowly roll your murderball towards the enemy for a moshpit fight spamming heals as needed. Boring and exceptionally weak strategically. Looks cool though.Daemon Lord is a bit boring. I only tried him out after they massively buffed everything about him since he was the worst LL in any role ever released. I can remember lords from Rome 1 with better campaign and battle bonuses/strengths, like Numidia. I ended up going undivided but it was the last campaign I played and I was thoroughly sick of the game by then. No blood no KhorneCannot stand slaanesh and its 'champions'. Ironically the faction is mostly broken technically or by design like if you use your uber seduction mechanic to seduce an order faction into a vassal - which should be seen as a victory for chaos - all the other Daemon factions will instantly declare war on you. Making the entire point of the factions' strengths redundant.Greasus and the other Ogre are unfinished, factions that suffer from being a pre order faction like Chaos in WH1. The primary mechanic of contracts can be safely (and should be) ignored since you just end up going to war with everyone around you for practically non existent gold and reputation rewards. It should be closer to Cathay's caravan mechanic and allow you to siege and kill a certain character or settlement or achieve something without it ruining your diplomacy. Or offer some kind of redemption contract after the fact to get back in the good graces of whoever you where paid a pittance to mess up. Currently it is a really ♥♥♥♥ 'Declare war against random visible faction every 10 turns' mechanic with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rewards making the best choice every time to simply ignore it. Ogres have good units that are fun and interesting. Some are extremely strong. If the gorgers are anything to go by MP will have the rest gutted into uselessness while being stupidly expensive like they are now but worth it.Overall the campaign map might be ""bigger than ever"" but it feels tiny since more than half is barren Chaos territory that you cannot reasonably conquer if not a daemonic faction. Daemonic factions have critical issues all round - thought I have heard Skarbrand is fine, except I see the lack of blood and gore a serious critical issue when playing a khornate faction. The Chaos realms are ♥♥♥♥. The idea is ♥♥♥♥. Tzeentch's realm literally cheats and has no counter play beyond hoping the AI doesn't go there while you are there, or spawns near you so you can quickly take them out before they auto complete it. Being forced to interact with a timed mechanic that can auto lose your campaign does not work in Total War. The vortex campaign was not that great but at least the art, mechanics and scripts were all complete. Most of the end cut scenes do not even have depictions of your LL interacting with Ursun. Just the same scene with a voice over. Compared to WH2 where there were custom scenes per race with some altered per LL that were not 20 secs long and you had 6 times of them. Overall the Vortex campaign spawned in armies just like the Realm race and they had issues like some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around in someone elses territory raiding it but being unable to be fought by whoever they were not spawned against. However you had the option to gang up on the 'winner' of the vortex race if it wasn't you and fight them, permanently ending the whole thing and allowing you to continue.Survival battles and the last one against belakor are interesting maybe once each per faction. Then they become a bore. But you cannot auto resolve the final fight. Not to mention the reward of getting Belakor who is a terrible LL and is only unlocked for your current playthrough with no bonus faction unlock is atrocious. They already have everything he needs in game for a faction and literally should be available as an option instead of the custom Daemon Lord. Maybe Immortal Empires will fix all of this, it is not coming out till Sept 22' at the earliest and is already declared a Beta. CA is the largest developer in the UK and yet they are proving beyond doubt that they clearly have bled most of their competency and talent out of the main dev teams. There are numerous, incredibly simple design/script/visual errors that modders literally fixed in a week that took CA 6 weeks to address 10% of. Even then most of the easiest to fix ones.CA clearly doesn't play their own game. Internally it must be chaos there (no pun intended).

"2023 CA is probably one of the biggest examples in gaming today of a company and dev team who think that they should just be able to do whatever they want and expect consumers to pay whatever they want to charge for it and that any consumer who goes ""Hey, wait a minute, you're not producing things *I* want and your prices are ridiculous"" is some sort of mean horrible troll who just doesn't understand how hard it is to be CA.

"2023 CS2 is literally the end result of what Valorant and CSGO having a baby looks like, the only difference is that the baby (cs2) does not have super powers / abilities, i.e. being able to access the astro world / teleportation / jelly creatures that can plant the bomb/spike for you while you obliterate the enemy team.However, CS2 is by far the best major upgrade to a game that i have ever seen from Valve. The game is truly wonderful with a heavy focus on providing good & improved User Experience for its players... From the sound design, the graphical user interface changes and changes across all the maps and even the inventory system... In this department the game designers & developers did a good job for sure!.With that said, CS2 is far from perfect... The game is a bit too bright by default on most of the maps and this can be hard to adjust to, but once you are used to it its great (you might have to adjust your game brightness settings for CS2 at first) other areas that need improvements pertain to the action of strafing sideways while moving, this action now feels a bit inaccurate & sometimes the strafe just doesn't hit right (almost like an angled strafe movement), as compared to the legacy version CSGO which was just straight forward left or right. However, these minor observations do not take away from the overall beauty of the upgraded game.Is CS2 better than CSGO overall?... well that depends on what a player prioritizes, if visuals like that of Valorant impress you, then you will love CS2. & if you come from csgo and love the static style that it had you might need to re-learn the game and adapt a little, but it is indeed Very fun despite all that... 8/10 NB: Just Remember to MUTE everyone if you are not in a premade lobby!",liter end result valor csgo babi look like differ babi super power abil ie abl access astro world teleport jelli creatur plant bombspik obliter enemi teamhowev far best major upgrad game ever seen valv game truli wonder heavi focu provid good improv user experi player sound design graphic user interfac chang chang across map even inventori system depart game design develop good job surewith said far perfect game bit bright default map hard adjust use great might adjust game bright set first area need improv pertain action strafe sideway move action feel bit inaccur sometim strafe doesnt hit right almost like angl strafe movement compar legaci version csgo straight forward left right howev minor observ take away overal beauti upgrad gamei better csgo overal well depend player priorit visual like valor impress love come csgo love static style might need relearn game adapt littl inde fun despit nb rememb mute everyon premad lobbi

"It's like I have 100 good things to say and 99 bad. That is still 100 good things, but still 99 bad. The environments, cinematics, and overall presentation of the game are outstanding, and almost make up for the shallow combat, broken/bs boss mechanics, and dreadful exploration. That said, the combat is still fun, the boss fights are still epic, and the levels are still beautiful, there's just a lot of bad things about them too. The voice acting, story, and overall message are great, but super difficult to follow if you haven't read JTTW/watched the cartoon as a kid. Spirits/transformations are cool but most are seldom useful. Upgrade system exists. The graphics are beautiful, but need to be configured properly and the optimization is poor.All of that said, the game is filled with content - including optional and secret content that did not get cut and made into DLC like many other games would. Major props for that. It feels like a FINISHED game (except for technical issues).For all of my complaints, I still played the game and almost finished a NG+ at the time of review.

"2022 So after almost 60 hours, I've completed 3 campaigns and poked around at a handful of others. The game has some shining spots in it while also having a lot of major issues with the gameplay and performance at the moment.Pros:-WH3 is absolutely beautiful when graphics are turned to high. The detail of the map, battle maps, and units are very detailed.-The factions are very fun to play depending on how you like to play your campaigns. I find that most units are balanced well throughout each faction's roster.-The Narrative is absolutely amazing overall. During my first playthrough, I was captivated by the prologue and the story told throughout.-The soundtrack is amazing to listen to while playing as certain factions. Cons:-The game does not perform well at all even if you have a strong computer. It is impossible to have more than 25 frames if you are running any other program in the background. I could only achieve 60 fps by turning all of my graphics settings down.-The mechanics of the base campaign are ATROCIOUS. Without going into too much detail, the main campaign requires you to complete 4 different chaos areas which significantly punish you for completing them. Unlike the previous campaign ion WH2, you are FORCED to play the narrative even if you don't want to. If you would like to read more on why the chaos mechanic is atrocious go read LegendofTotalWar's post on it.-Because of the previously stated problem, there is no incentive to continue to play the game with the forced narrative because you have already seen it. After the first few campaigns, it becomes somewhat repetitive to deal with making the game not fun.Overall I would recommend this game yes, but after they have fixed some of the mechanics and the campaign or release Mortal Empires version.",almost hour ive complet campaign poke around hand other game shine spot also lot major issu gameplay perform absolut beauti graphic turn high detail map battl map unit detailedth faction fun play depend like play campaign find unit balanc well throughout faction rosterth narr absolut amaz overal first playthrough captiv prologu stori told throughoutth soundtrack amaz listen play certain faction consth game perform well even strong comput imposs frame run program background could achiev fp turn graphic set downth mechan base campaign atroci without go much detail main campaign requir complet differ chao area significantli punish complet unlik previou campaign ion forc play narr even dont want would like read chao mechan atroci go read legendoftotalwar post itbecaus previous state problem incent continu play game forc narr alreadi seen first campaign becom somewhat repetit deal make game funoveral would recommend game ye fix mechan campaign releas mortal empir version

"As a Chinese, after playing through Black Myth: Wukong, I have a few suggestions for those interested in its story line and cultural elements:first of all, do not try to understand all the elements in the game, its ♥♥♥♥♥ impossible. i.e., monsters(yaoguai) could quote Confucius(Decayed wood cannot be carved), etc.2. Don't start by reading the novel Journey to the West; it's long and challenging to understand. It incorporates a lot of Chinese philosophical thought (such as Buddhist and Taoist ideas) and can be interpreted from many angles including political and cultural perspectives, each offering a completely different yet plausible explanation. If you want to quickly understand Journey to the West, just watch the 1986 TV series by the same name. After watching it, playing the game will give you a completely different experience. 3. Chinese language tends to be implicit. Simply put, it's often indirect, this tend to happens in a collectivist society, especially China. For example, highly-rated Chinese dramas often involve a lot of implicit expression, meaning they don't directly state viewpoints or phenomena(you have to analyze the hided meaning behind the script). House of Cards as a US drama, fits well with what I consider a typical preference among Chinese people. So, when playing the game or watching the show, you might try to analyze the logic and motives behind each sentence.I'll give a hint here: you may find that some monsters knows Wukong had a position in the ""haven"", this type of monster usually call Wukong ""horses keeper/protector""(Wukong was assigned a job alike cowboy(horse-boy) in haven), when they call Wukong horseboy, Wukong usually wont fight em directly. instead, Wukong will try find some help from haven(to see who is the ""owner"" or ""master"" of the monster), eventually, the monster will back to the haven. however, the ending of most monsters without background is DEATH.",chines play black myth wukong suggest interest stori line cultur elementsfirst tri understand element game imposs ie monstersyaoguai could quot confuciusdecay wood carv dont start read novel journey west long challeng understand incorpor lot chines philosoph thought buddhist taoist idea interpret mani angl includ polit cultur perspect offer complet differ yet plausibl explan want quickli understand journey west watch tv seri name watch play game give complet differ experi chines languag tend implicit simpli put often indirect tend happen collectivist societi especi china exampl highlyr chines drama often involv lot implicit express mean dont directli state viewpoint phenomenay analyz hide mean behind script hous card us drama fit well consid typic prefer among chines peopl play game watch show might tri analyz logic motiv behind sentenceil give hint may find monster know wukong posit type monster usual call wukong hors keeperprotectorwukong assign job alik cowboyhorseboy call wukong horseboy wukong usual wont fight em directli instead wukong tri find help havento see owner master monster eventu monster back howev end monster without background death

"2023 This game feels like a corpse that's just being marionetted by a marketing team. I've tried desperately to like it, inhaling as much copium as I can because I bought so much of the DLC, particularly because I'm a big Warhammer fan and longtime total war fan. Its lost so much of what made total war a great franchise and its obvious that creative assembly isn't the same company that made the previous installments that brought total war to the forefront of strategy games.They rushed warhammer 3 out the door at least a year or so too early and it's clear their MO is to release half-baked games and never fix them. So many glitches and issues still plague this game which are too numerous to mention, with some still existing from the previous warhammer 2 installment. Some of these issues are egregious, with things like a legendary lord who specializes in a certain unit losing the ability to even recruit that unit for months after a patch, with the issue still being present at the time of this writing (though fixed by the incredible modding community that CA doesn't deserve). Their priority is to release the rest of the game as piecemealed DLCs, which for a time were just a bad value, have developed into basically a full on scam. Higher prices for less content and absolutely no care for taking time to iron out the many issues of the game first.It seems they have no intention on budging from this approach, just continuing to staple overpriced garbage onto the game, releasing ""patches"" that end up creating new issues, and overall just suffocating the game with a mountain of technical debt. Even if creative assembly releases a game that fans have been clamoring for, like Medieval 3, what's the point? It's just going to have the same issues that have marred the series for a long time, like poor AI and uninteresting sieges, while at the same time cranking up the level of greed with pricier DLCs and promises of ""fixing"" the game with vague roadmaps that they never follow. There is no more innovation, there is no more analyzation of what makes the core of total war fun and improving on that. It's just a total ♥♥♥♥ show. The drop of support for the three kingdoms game due to a lack of DLC purchases should have been a warning sign. What kind of an abusive game do they want players to take part in? You better buy our half-baked, overpriced DLCs or else we'll stop support for the game that we released in an unfinished state? But if you buy the DLCs, we'll just keep making more half-baked, overpriced DLCs and we won't actually bother to fix the game we released in an initial broken state? It seems like it's a lose-lose for the players, and frankly a spit in the face. There's better games out there that are worth your time and money, and this series isn't among them any longer.",game feel like corps that marionet market team ive tri desper like inhal much copium bought much dlc particularli im big warhamm fan longtim total war fan lost much made total war great franchis obviou creativ assembl isnt compani made previou instal brought total war forefront strategi gamesthey rush warhamm door least year earli clear mo releas halfbak game never fix mani glitch issu still plagu game numer mention still exist previou warhamm instal issu egregi thing like legendari lord special certain unit lose abil even recruit unit month patch issu still present time write though fix incred mod commun ca doesnt deserv prioriti releas rest game piecem dlc time bad valu develop basic full scam higher price less content absolut care take time iron mani issu game firstit seem intent budg approach continu stapl overpr garbag onto game releas patch end creat new issu overal suffoc game mountain technic debt even creativ assembl releas game fan clamor like mediev what point go issu mar seri long time like poor ai uninterest sieg time crank level greed pricier dlc promis fix game vagu roadmap never follow innov analyz make core total war fun improv total show drop support three kingdom game due lack dlc purchas warn sign kind abus game want player take part better buy halfbak overpr dlc els well stop support game releas unfinish state buy dlc well keep make halfbak overpr dlc wont actual bother fix game releas initi broken state seem like loselos player frankli spit face there better game worth time money seri isnt among longer

"2023 Elden Ring was one of the most thrilling and satisfying games I've ever played. The atmosphere completely drew me in, and I had an immense pleasure exploring the world for hours. The game's difficulty might seem intimidating at first, but as I played and learned the enemy attack patterns, the challenge further motivated me. Each victory gave me a tremendous sense of accomplishment.The gameplay was fluid and finely crafted. The controls were responsive, and my movements directly translated to my character. It required time and practice to master the combat system, but the process was incredibly satisfying for me. The inclusion of different weapon and magic options allowed me to diversify my playstyle and provided opportunities to employ different strategies in each battle.In terms of in-game richness, Elden Ring did not disappoint me. There was always a new area to explore, a hidden item to discover, or an intriguing character to encounter around every corner. The bosses' designs, stories, and fighting styles were remarkably impressive. Engaging in side quests and making choices to unravel the stories of characters further connected me to the game world. Additionally, the time loop system allowed me to experience different encounters and events, making each playthrough exciting.Elden Ring's story completely immersed me. The lore and world design were profound and captivating. The backgrounds of the characters, the history of the world, and the events unfolding in this chaotic realm constantly pulled me deeper into the game, fueling my desire for more exploration.In conclusion, Elden Ring was an unforgettable experience for me. Its beautiful gameplay, challenging nature, richly crafted world, and captivating story kept me glued to the screen for hours.

"Very good game. The actual campaign is amazing 10/10. The only problem I have is that the multiplayer is currently very unreliable. In-order for it to even work, you need to disable steam overlay otherwise you'll be trapped in infinite loading screens, and even after that frequent server disconnects and lag are an ever present issue. However, since the core game play is great, after the post release patch which addresses these issue, I have no dought this will be a great game. PS. I found that campaign difficulty was over tuned. Playing on veteran originally which is the hard mode, I found the game incredibly frustrating; I imagine this is because the game was balanced around coop play since your ai squad mates are virtually useless. In order to enjoy your experience, I would recommend playing on normal because otherwise you're trying to do the job of three players.",good game actual campaign amaz problem multiplay current unreli inord even work need disabl steam overlay otherwis youll trap infinit load screen even frequent server disconnect lag ever present issu howev sinc core game play great post releas patch address issu dought great game ps found campaign difficulti tune play veteran origin hard mode found game incred frustrat imagin game balanc around coop play sinc ai squad mate virtual useless order enjoy experi would recommend play normal otherwis your tri job three player

"2022 After completing two playthroughs of the game here's my review:Elden Ring is the best souls-like game ever made. It is the culmination of everything FROM SOFTWARE has learned over the last decade. It has every ounce of the challenge compared to the previous titles if not even more and is super fun to play. The art design is breathtaking, the level design stunning, the soundtrack slams, the boss designs have gotten even better since the previous games and the world is huge and beautiful with tons of exploration.Here's a list of things i liked about the game:1. Power-stancing. Gives a unique moveset for using two weapons of the same class.2. Spirit Summons. Allows you to get that extra help without buffing the boss. Also super useful for casters and for exploring areas with a lot of tough enemies.3.Ashes of War. You can finally make weapons more unique and useful by manually assigning weapon arts depending on the situation.4. Removal of the Vitality stat allows using heavy armour without having to spend levels on a seperate stat which is really good. Before you had to level up vitality to wear and use heavy gear which is now tied to the stamina attrifbute.Here's a list of things i disliked about the game:1. Early-game exploration. The Early game exploration for Elden Ring is slightly boring. Nothing in Limgrave is super-useful except for 3 weapons. Most of the benefits of exploration come in mid-late game where most of the good weapons spells and talismans are.2. Heavy weapons (Greatswords, Colossal Swords, Colossal weapons) have been nerfed since the previous title. Much slower swing speeds, follow-ups and recovery. I hope they release a patch to buff the recovery time. In their current state they are almost useless against fast and hard hitting enemies that have moderate amount of poise. On top of this, they buffed katanas and other small swords making them meta for the time due to their speed and ability to power-stance for damage. 3. Weapons that have split damage Arcane scaling (Rivers of Blood, Elenora's Poleblade, Mohgywn Sacred Spear) are broken. They have flat damage values and do not scale with your attributes despite having scaling values. Hope a patch in the future will fix this.4. A lot of the open-world bosses are repeats and duos. Repeat bosses are kinda boring to fight again and again. Duos are irritating. They dont have a unique dynamic like Ornstein and Smough, one being fast and the other being slow or having an arena to split aggro, most duo bosses in this game are just two of the same boss shoved in a small room with barely any cover. They have the same speed and gank the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.5. Performance Issues. Frame Drops, Freezing when using the steam overlay or Alt-Tabbing. Game Crashes.

"I feel like it's going to be another ""bought on release, and stopped playing a week later"" game, but I am hoping I am wrong. It looks fantastic, weapons got some punch to them, swarms look pretty decent (kinda wish Helldivers 2 was like that), sounds, voice lines, everything seems to be on point.But there are bugs - voices tend to cut out, and it seems to be a common issue. Characters are a bit squishy, at least on veteran difficulty. I didn't like being super squishy in Vermintide either, but thankfully it's not as bad (close though).There is no co-op matchmaking for campaign, which is bizarre in 2024. You'd think only Destiny devs are clueless enough to never add a simple matchmaking tool to make everyone at least 75% happier and finding people easier, but here were are. The campaign itself is rather bland and by the numbers, but that's what you get from Warhammer games and it's universe. Not a lot of wiggle room or creativity, just more violence. Haven't tried multiplayer modes yet, and will update the review if they change my opinion, but I doubt they will.Definitely recommend for people that like the universe and want to continue Space Marine 1 story, but for everyone else... wait for more updates, dlc's and discounts.UPDAfter finishing it and trying pve, I don't recommend this game after all - the campaign is extremely short. Even on veteran difficulty it will probably take you less than 10 hours, and if you are a decent player or using lower difficulty - probably much less.Matchmaking for operations (pve mode) is non-existent. Either nobody will join, so you need to quit to main menu and start again, or it puts you with people on the other side of the planet and 500 ping, and if the host disconnects - its over, host migration seems to be broken. There are way too many loading screens, and despite playing on Samsung 990 nvme and beast of the machine - the game takes a long time to load, getting stuck on various server connections that are required even for single player campaign, and on operations it just might get stuck forever and fail to load.Responsiveness of the game itself is also questionable. For a game centered around hordes of enemies and fast paced combat - its unacceptable to have any hiccups or delays because of the broken animations or game deciding to take a break in the middle of your weapon swing, or shields not shielding, or jetpacks not kicking in, or your character simply getting frozen and unable to move. From what I can tell - most of the effort in multiplayer went into armor customization and various cosmetics, rather than optimization and polishing. Finally, there are some very serious issues with balancing, with assault class being extremely weak, and people outright laughing at it or refusing to play with it, and bulwark or vanguard being preferred and much easier to play.",feel like go anoth bought releas stop play week later game hope wrong look fantast weapon got punch swarm look pretti decent kinda wish helldiv like sound voic line everyth seem pointbut bug voic tend cut seem common issu charact bit squishi least veteran difficulti didnt like super squishi vermintid either thank bad close thoughther coop matchmak campaign bizarr youd think destini dev clueless enough never add simpl matchmak tool make everyon least happier find peopl easier campaign rather bland number that get warhamm game univers lot wiggl room creativ violenc havent tri multiplay mode yet updat review chang opinion doubt willdefinit recommend peopl like univers want continu space marin stori everyon els wait updat dlc discountsupdaft finish tri pve dont recommend game campaign extrem short even veteran difficulti probabl take less hour decent player use lower difficulti probabl much lessmatchmak oper pve mode nonexist either nobodi join need quit main menu start put peopl side planet ping host disconnect host migrat seem broken way mani load screen despit play samsung nvme beast machin game take long time load get stuck variou server connect requir even singl player campaign oper might get stuck forev fail loadrespons game also question game center around hord enemi fast pace combat unaccept hiccup delay broken anim game decid take break middl weapon swing shield shield jetpack kick charact simpli get frozen unabl move tell effort multiplay went armor custom variou cosmet rather optim polish final seriou issu balanc assault class extrem weak peopl outright laugh refus play bulwark vanguard prefer much easier play

"My PC specs is i5-12600k+3060ti and running the game with the 'High' setting. There're few things I wanna talk about:-The intro video is awesome, however my specs is not enough to provide a good quality video, it's all dot pixel around the shape of character. Actually I have the same issue while running the benchmark tool, something like a spider web floats on the river. So basically, the graphic is not that good imo, unless you have higher GPU. In exchange, the game runs super smooth while playing.-The difficulty of boss fight is harder than my expectation, you still need to manage character stamina to either attack or doge, but way more easier than the DarkSoul series. You can stop the boss or transform into monsters with high attack power to deal more damage. Also, go check the skill tree to build up a good set can reduce the difficulty as well.-The map exploration is not that bad as some media said. The game is not open-world, so it's easy to find the way back if you reach the edge of map. There're many forked roads, so be patient in exploring them, they may leads you to different bosses or some items.At all to say, the game 'Black Myth:Wukong' definitely has some flaws at the first day release, but still worth to buy and play.

"2022 All right...What can I say about Elden Ring as a person who has played every From-Software game multiple times over, that hasn't already been said? My first blind and (luckily) spoiler-shielded playthrough on my first character clocked in at 87 hours, in that time i killed every boss, did every dungeon, and got 100% of the achievements. This means that Elden ring has packed over 100 hours of content for the average player, and almost as much for us die-hard From-Sorftware fans. 100 hours of content is perfectly scattered throughout The Lands Between and the fluidity and pace of exploration, makes Elden Ring (in my own opinion) the greatest open world game we have seen. Every enemy, item, dungeon and grace location is and feels intentional and this creates the amazing game world which i now love more than Yharnam, Lothric, Drangleic, Ashina, Boletaria and even The ageless kingdom of Lordran. The lore is amazing, the characters richer, the weapons are many and more impactful, the magic is better than ever, The bosses grander, the flow of combat nearly perfected, the world is bigger, and for the first time (to many new player's delight) you have real choice, not just the illusion of choice like the master key...looking at you Dark souls purists. Does Elden Ring have flaws? yes, one. Can you fix it? yes actually. As many of the steam reviews will tell you, the game has ""performance issues"" in form of stuttering and FPS issues. I newly bought a high end pc and the game had these issues for me as well, BUT i fixed them, and so can you. now the game runs perfectly and without a single issue.

What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot.

"2023 Between Warhammer 1-3, I have thousands of hours and believe this is arguable one of the best fantasy strategy games. The diversity of fantasy races is large. Each faction also adds enough uniqueness that there is a great deal of replay value. If you enjoy strategy games, this should be in your library.Please note that there is a lot of DLC and most can be bought on sale (which occur very often and I would highly suggest waiting for a sale, they happen almost every other month). Also, the base games count as expansions for warhammer 3 and offer access to 4 races each. Also, getting the most recent DLC would grant access to base-level content from previous DLC for the same race. For instance, Champions of Chaos will provide content from older Warriors of Chaos DLC or the new Thrones of Decay will grant access to content from Warhammer 1 (dwarfs and empire).Post-Thrones of Decay DLC, CA has shown a commitment to updating the core campaign experience and deliver better customer value. There have finally been patches to core gameplay issues such as AI pathing and responsiveness that has made battles much more enjoyable again. There is a plan to move to smaller DLC packs going forward. As long as these smaller packs include reworks and campaign balancing, I recommend playing Warhammer 3. If CA goes back to their greedy, anti-customer practices pre-Thrones of Decay, I will be sure to change my review. For now, it appears CA is back to its Warhammer 2 glory days where making great content and keeping the game patched and fresh.",warhamm thousand hour believ arguabl one best fantasi strategi game divers fantasi race larg faction also add enough uniqu great deal replay valu enjoy strategi game librarypleas note lot dlc bought sale occur often would highli suggest wait sale happen almost everi month also base game count expans warhamm offer access race also get recent dlc would grant access baselevel content previou dlc race instanc champion chao provid content older warrior chao dlc new throne decay grant access content warhamm dwarf empirepostthron decay dlc ca shown commit updat core campaign experi deliv better custom valu final patch core gameplay issu ai path respons made battl much enjoy plan move smaller dlc pack go forward long smaller pack includ rework campaign balanc recommend play warhamm ca goe back greedi anticustom practic prethron decay sure chang review appear ca back warhamm glori day make great content keep game patch fresh

Good shooter? :D This is all what i can say about like game looks like. You can say:"" Oh game looks pretty good and alot of my friends are playing in it i must to try too!"" But i must to warn you. If you are very sensetive person and testy like choleric[en.wikipedia.org] i really don't reccomend this game for you. In this moment yes this game become really worst game in the world. First of all rank system if you care about your rank -> you will care about lose or win( of cource you want to win) -> you will start to rage, insult, rude. Ask yourself please does this game cost your nerves? Does this rank cost your nerves? Just imagine libra in your mind and on one side put all bad things which happend in this game to you all bad days, games, etcetera and all good things which happend to you in this game and you will see the truth. But if you are actually not a raging person and really dont care about your rank or will you win or lose like me :) Grab your friends in there and play for FUN! There are alot of funny stuff...ehm..runboost, bhop, some tricks, lucky shots, knife/zeus trolling, etcetera... you can even just laugh with friends and play! Or if you alone just play on yourself try to make some good kills but remember no rage...Anyway i can talk here really alot of time about smurfing, cheaters, guys who calls everybody a cheater xD, etcetera.But do we need this? I think we dont :P So actually i can't say that i recommend this game for someone this is a good game for someone the worst game ever so this is not me to decide this for you. Everybody already maked his/her choice.P.S.: I reached what i wanted and i stop to play this game.

"Reviewed in August 2024:Based on my PvE server experience probably the best Free-To-Play (and minimal PAY2WIN!) game out there.This is basically a post-apocalyptic survival shooter MMORPG where you must explore, build a home, find food and water, and kill some zombies and bizarre creatures. The variety of main quests and enemies are great, although most of them are copycat from other games and movies. The story, well... the dialogue sounds like google translated from Chinese to English which sometimes create corny moments (i skipped 80% of the cutscenes)You can complete the entire main quest solo, immersing yourself in hours of base building, exploration, and combat. However, playing with a group is even more enjoyable and beneficial, as you can share resources and support one another.Main quests take around 40-50 hours to complete, excluding side quests. In the endgame, depending on your specialization, you can farm crafting resources, prepare canned foods and drinks for stat buffs, craft tools, and sell them to others. Alternatively, you can focus become a dungeon warlord, taking on hard bosses and participating in Prime War—a 1-40 player PvE event against advanced bosses.Cons of this game:- Progress resets every 6 weeks, with only a few items being preserved while most are reset.- If the server is full, you won't be able to create a character to play with your friend. The developers have mentioned they plan to introduce a character server transfer option in the future.- Prime War can be a bit laggy, but new players don't need to worry since it's an optional objective.- So many bugs that i can't even list- Needs more optimization and performs poorly on HDD computers (I experience constant texture pop-ins)- Story is mediocre and has many questionable lore (who cares about story in multiplayer games though xD)My rating:80/100",review august pve server experi probabl best freetoplay minim game therethi basic postapocalypt surviv shooter mmorpg must explor build home find food water kill zombi bizarr creatur varieti main quest enemi great although copycat game movi stori well dialogu sound like googl translat chines english sometim creat corni moment skip cutscenesy complet entir main quest solo immers hour base build explor combat howev play group even enjoy benefici share resourc support one anothermain quest take around hour complet exclud side quest endgam depend special farm craft resourc prepar can food drink stat buff craft tool sell other altern focu becom dungeon warlord take hard boss particip prime wara player pve event advanc bossescon game progress reset everi week item preserv reset server full wont abl creat charact play friend develop mention plan introduc charact server transfer option futur prime war bit laggi new player dont need worri sinc option object mani bug cant even list need optim perform poorli hdd comput experi constant textur popin stori mediocr mani question lore care stori multiplay game though xdmi

"2022 I have 59 hours in this game and I think I'm still 5-10 hours from beating it. (lol good one, it took me about 80 hours to beat my first play through and then I kept playing. I found TWO new areas after I had beaten the final boss) I have done nothing since 4pm on Thursday, February 24th but wake up, play this game, and go to sleep. If you are concerned about not liking open worlds but you like FromSoft games, just give Elden Ring a chance, I swear it will be worth it. Most open world games for the last decade are full of nothing. They look nice, but have next to zero substance. Elden Ring's open world is comparable to Breath of the Wild, and no game in since BotW's release has made me feel the way BotW did. Every way is the right way. There is insane new stuff around every corner. You'll think you have dementia because every 20 minutes you'll find some insane new thing and forget what you were actually trying to do beforehand. It's not a graphical marvel, but FromSoft has never had the chance to apply their style to a fully realized world, and the Lands Between are jaw dropping at times, and always stunning regardless of your location. While at its core its still SoulsBorne, it's hard to compare to the rest of the series because of how much of a difference the open world makes. Elden Ring was worth the wait, and is easily one of my favorite games of all time. This game is worth full price and always will be and you should support FromSoftware and buy this game at $60 if you can afford to do so. Hopefully they will be making memorable and creative games for the forseeable future.If you are worried about the PC performance issues many people have complained about, here is my input on them. I have a 2070 super, 32GB of ram, and an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor 3.59 GHz. It only occasionally (every 15-30 minutes maybe) stutters when I'm in a large open area or when there are lots of particle effects on screen. It's not unplayable, it is a second or two of reduced framerate. It has never gotten me killed or made the difference between life or death in 60 hours. It is locked at 60fps, which is not a problem to me and it shouldn't be to you either. Like I said, FromSoft games have never been graphical innovators. The difference between 60 and 120 frames is negligible and FromSoft has made it clear they're working to optimize it as much as possible. There has been noticeable improvement from day 1 even. You could probably run this game just fine with a 1070 as the recommended specs suggest. It's not unplayable unless you're a complete snob, in which case I suggest you remove the graphics card from your rear end.",hour game think im still hour beat lol good one took hour beat first play kept play found two new area beaten final boss done noth sinc thursday februari wake play game go sleep concern like open world like fromsoft game give elden ring chanc swear worth open world game last decad full noth look nice next zero substanc elden ring open world compar breath wild game sinc botw releas made feel way botw everi way right way insan new stuff around everi corner youll think dementia everi minut youll find insan new thing forget actual tri beforehand graphic marvel fromsoft never chanc appli style fulli realiz world land jaw drop time alway stun regardless locat core still soulsborn hard compar rest seri much differ open world make elden ring worth wait easili one favorit game time game worth full price alway support fromsoftwar buy game afford hope make memor creativ game forseeabl futureif worri pc perform issu mani peopl complain input super ram amd ryzen processor ghz occasion everi minut mayb stutter im larg open area lot particl effect screen unplay second two reduc framer never gotten kill made differ life death hour lock problem shouldnt either like said fromsoft game never graphic innov differ frame neglig fromsoft made clear theyr work optim much possibl notic improv day even could probabl run game fine recommend spec suggest unplay unless your complet snob case suggest remov graphic card rear end

There have been a lot of crappy things Creative Assembly have done which tanked the games score, but of the past few months they have been doing very well with the quality of dlc, updates, and listening to community feedback. who knows if this will stay true but at the end of the day what matters is overall as it stands right now is the game good? Yes, if you like this genre and style of game then this is IMO one of the best game you can buy right now only issue is the price of entry which as others have said I highly recommend buying things on sale which is very easy to find online.",never write review see ive play game tini bit realli love despit flaw mostli want write dont feel mix review score realli game justic keep short possibl ill say game ton option fun hell lot crappi thing creativ assembl done tank game score past month well qualiti dlc updat listen commun feedback know stay true end day matter overal stand right game good ye like genr style game imo one best game buy right issu price entri other said highli recommend buy thing sale easi find onlin

"2022 2.2 pretty much killed Warhammer for me.Major Update, but no game breaking bugfixes like Drycha and Repanse Quest Battle fix. Instead we got rid of settlement layouts and in reverse we get a boring ass open field battle simulator against 10 and less Stack Armies. thanks to the fact that they ""increased the focus of the AI on building garrison buildings"" but they don't. I played multiple campagins since 2.2 and in no campaign did the AI ever build any garrison buildings.Only a minority of players wanted more field battles and because of that they removed settlement battles and made settlements useless overall on many factions, especially Bretonia is unplayable since 2.2 update. Good job CA by doing the worst thing possible instead of making the AI not run away from your armies every time. That alone would have made the ""more field battles"" crowd happy, because guess what ? It would trigger more field battles and the rest could still enjoy they settlement battles.Right now I can't recommend this game at all. And as long as they don't reverse this dumpster fire update I won't give them a thumbs up.",pretti much kill warhamm memajor updat game break bugfix like drycha repans quest battl fix instead got rid settlement layout revers get bore ass open field battl simul less stack armi thank fact increas focu ai build garrison build dont play multipl campagin sinc campaign ai ever build garrison buildingsonli minor player want field battl remov settlement battl made settlement useless overal mani faction especi bretonia unplay sinc updat good job ca worst thing possibl instead make ai run away armi everi time alon would made field battl crowd happi guess would trigger field battl rest could still enjoy settlement battlesright cant recommend game long dont revers dumpster fire updat wont give thumb

"2022 This game needs a lot of work in order for me to recommend it. The AI is annoying to play against on the battlefield, the settlements battles are annoying, especially the minor settlement battles. In my time playing this game I cannot bring myself to play past turn 100, I'll have been annoyed to death from the way the AI behaves in battles or bored over how the AI never seems to be able to build itself up to be a decent threat against me. ""End-game crises"" is the way that CA wants to address this issue I think. But I find that goes against the sandbox nature of the game, I don't want a magical switch to be flipped and have to deal with Mega-Armies with no upkeep for the AI to throw against me. I want an AI that is competent enough to build itself up to present a good threat against me. The crises are boring, an AI that is all natural and grown in the wild is fun and engaging.In the end, I don't want to fight the battles because the AI tries to Lord snipe you whenever possible. The AI dodging artillery attacks was cool the first time I saw it, but after playing for 100 or so hours on IE I find it to be just annoying to watch the amount of dancing and dodging the AI does. Just fight me, just fight me man, I just want fun. Unit mass changes are annoying to me as well, cavalry peeling doesn't feel as good. I find that because of the pressure of making sure my lords don't melt to other AI shenanigans that I can't keep up with the other micro that is expected of certain army compositions. This leads me to just spam low effort cheap units to fight my battles, and it works. Lvl 1 kossar units for kislev can carry your entire campaign, you just have to fight your battles. My list of grudges can go on but I will stop here.In the end, I uninstalled after realizing I wasn't having fun. I was just doing micro dances with the AI instead of having the fun and engaging battles like I had in Warhammer 2. I can't bring myself to play this game anymore.

"This game introduced a fresh vibe to the gaming world with a unique system that blends the style of God of War and Souls games. The gameplay is incredibly engaging and fits the story perfectly.The world is absolutely beautiful, and the graphics need no further praise—we’ve all seen the incredible details the game delivered using the new Unreal Engine 5. Even though the development team is relatively new to AAA third-person games, they crafted a visual masterpiece. However, the game is quite demanding and could use more optimization on various platforms. Even with my RTX 4090, I had to lower some settings to maintain high frame rates.One issue I had with the world design is that when I wanted to revisit older areas, I often forgot the locations and had to retrace my steps, which was tiring. The absence of a map in the game made this process even more challenging. This alone can cause players to miss out on important content or side bosses and rewards.Additionally, some of the secret areas were a bit misleading. I wouldn’t have discovered any of them without YouTube. You know the type—where you have to perform a million steps, many of which seem random, just to unlock a specific secret location.As for the bosses, I was absolutely thrilled with the fights. There’s a great variety, and each boss has a unique combat style. Every encounter felt different, requiring you to think of specific strategies to beat them. I really enjoyed the diversity and the number of bosses.The leveling system fits the gameplay style perfectly and was engaging, pushing me to explore secret areas and hidden bosses to strengthen my character and acquire new skills. The skill tree was diverse and extensive; even after completing the game, there were still many skills I hadn’t discovered or tried. This is a good sign that I’ll continue with New Game+.The story, while not the best in gaming, was enjoyable and gave me insight into Chinese cultures and characters.The game offers multiple endings.My final rating for the game is a solid 9 out of 10.",game introduc fresh vibe game world uniqu system blend style god war soul game gameplay incred engag fit stori perfectlyth world absolut beauti graphic need praisewev seen incred detail game deliv use new unreal engin even though develop team rel new aaa thirdperson game craft visual masterpiec howev game quit demand could use optim variou platform even rtx lower set maintain high frame rateson issu world design want revisit older area often forgot locat retrac step tire absenc map game made process even challeng alon caus player miss import content side boss rewardsaddit secret area bit mislead wouldnt discov without youtub know typewher perform million step mani seem random unlock specif secret locationa boss absolut thrill fight there great varieti boss uniqu combat style everi encount felt differ requir think specif strategi beat realli enjoy divers number bossesth level system fit gameplay style perfectli engag push explor secret area hidden boss strengthen charact acquir new skill skill tree divers extens even complet game still mani skill hadnt discov tri good sign ill continu new gameth stori best game enjoy gave insight chines cultur charactersth game offer multipl endingsmi final rate game solid

"PrefaceEver experience one of those moments in life when you're thankful to have lived long enough to witness an event? Honestly, I am blown away by the quality of Black Myth Wukong, and after completing chapter 1 in full, I can wholeheartedly say it is one of the most polished games in recent years to carry on the torch toward another golden age of gaming; an era in which we can say NO to delusional propaganda led by the woke crowd and truly immerse ourselves in masterful storytelling and peak gameplay.PositivesEnriched StorytellingA unique take on an existing mythological tale. Great storytelling in post-2020 media is a rare breed and Black Myth Wukong brings back a practice that many have forgotten in the past decade: the ancient art of ""show, don't tell."" As a result, a player with more than half a brain cell becomes intrigued, piqued with curiosity as to where the journey will take us next. That very simple step that produces the foundation of a great game, in and of itself, is something many fail to do in this generation. Hence, a praiseworthy achievement.A Realm To Visit More Than OnceFrom the first cutscene to being dropped into the world as an unknown adventure taking on the mantle of the hero Wukong, the environment takes your breath away. There is an ever-so-subtle ambience that is neither noisy nor silent, overwhelming nor underwhelming... neither raging nor soothing to the senses. It is the perfect balance of making you feel like you want to stay there forever yet progress to see what comes next. The mob enemies you come across are not as threatening as you may think, but provide a challenge once you approach. Bosses have a variety of moves and behaviors that allows you to enjoy the interaction throughout the grueling battles, and they're not mindbogglingly difficult enough to make you throw your controller out the window. The level of detail and quality placed into each animation of both the character and enemies, down to the simple action of opening a chest to find new gear/items shows the amount of love and passion that went into this project.Depth & ProgressionAs with storytelling, the character progression in the game is less so about ""wanting to become stronger"", but rather a sense of wanting to see what comes next in your journey. The other myriad of games I've played over the past few years have molded me into an elitist player, one who always min/maxes when he can to reach the endgame as quickly as possible before anyone else to play god. Every now and then, however, I come across a game that I go into with a different mindset; a mindset that allows me to slow down, take a breath, and enjoy the journey rather than seek the end result in a heartbeat. Two heartbeats rather than one: the difference is astounding when it comes to the human mind.Absence of Woke Propaganda & NonsenseWhenever I browse the internet in any form, I grieve at the thought of how the woke propaganda is contaminating our minds day by day, trying to brainwash the normal human mentality with ideas of delusion to make the abnormal a norm by forcefeeding outrageous ideas down our throats. Black Myth Wukong, in all of its so-called ""controversies"", takes a step closer to our roots. Not toxic masculinity. Not sexism. Not lack of diversity. Just a pure journey that rids our bodies and minds of any sense of superiority, inferiority, representation, diversity, abnormalities, delusion, or any of that other nonsense. This is a game, in all of its glory, that takes us back to the roots of a character that embarks on a journey. That's it. Nothing more. Nothing less. And I'm all for more of it in the years/decades to come.NegativesInvisible Wall ImplementationSo... this one's a bit of a divisive issue. Most open world games implement an invisible wall feature to block off players from areas that are ""in the world"" but inaccessible in-game, primarily to help with immersion. Black Myth Wukong does this flawlessly to make it so the world is there in its entirety with no questionable areas whatsoever, enough so that it's impossible to tell which parts of the world are accessible and which are not. This is one of those rare situations wherein if the player would really benefit from a map that at least displays the general area. But add to the fact that there is no map to refer to, it can get annoying when exploring for chests and/or spirits.The reason this might be an arguable pro/con is that most game companies have been getting flack during the past few years for spoonfeeding players to go here and there with an overly complicated and detailed map/UI (I'm looking at you Ubisoft). Games like Elden Ring had a natural flow to exploration with the use of a map so players can just have a general idea of where they are. Black Myth Wukong took exploration to even higher levels of letting the player have the freedom to do what he wants, yet some may argue that in this case the use of clear invisible walls might have helped (ironically).ConclusionFinal Verdict: A+Nowadays, a game doesn't have to be perfect or even called ""superb"" to be worthy of praise. So many games drop the ball fast and hard, trying to stick political agenda into video games or going for greedy live-service routes that don't last more than a few months. Gamers may need to touch grass sometimes, but we're not always stupid or braindead either. Above all, we're a customer base looking to buy a product that provides enjoyment.The return of the singleplayer game with a strong foundation of lore and gameplay is what I believe put the gaming industry on the map in the first place. And now that the industry has tried its hand in so many possible paths to try to find the ""perfect route"" to a stable era of gaming, titles like Elden Ring, Nioh, Ghost of Tsushima, and now Black Myth Wukong have proven time and time again that the single player action-RPG has once again laid a solid foundation to the path that truly satisfies the core audience.",prefaceev experi one moment life your thank live long enough wit event honestli blown away qualiti black myth wukong complet chapter full wholeheartedli say one polish game recent year carri torch toward anoth golden age game era say delusion propaganda led woke crowd truli immers master storytel peak gameplaypositivesenrich storytellinga uniqu take exist mytholog tale great storytel media rare breed black myth wukong bring back practic mani forgotten past decad ancient art show dont tell result player half brain cell becom intrigu piqu curios journey take us next simpl step produc foundat great game someth mani fail gener henc praiseworthi achievementa realm visit oncefrom first cutscen drop world unknown adventur take mantl hero wukong environ take breath away eversosubtl ambienc neither noisi silent overwhelm underwhelm neither rage sooth sens perfect balanc make feel like want stay forev yet progress see come next mob enemi come across threaten may think provid challeng approach boss varieti move behavior allow enjoy interact throughout gruel battl theyr mindbogglingli difficult enough make throw control window level detail qualiti place anim charact enemi simpl action open chest find new gearitem show amount love passion went projectdepth progressiona storytel charact progress game less want becom stronger rather sens want see come next journey myriad game ive play past year mold elitist player one alway minmax reach endgam quickli possibl anyon els play god everi howev come across game go differ mindset mindset allow slow take breath enjoy journey rather seek end result heartbeat two heartbeat rather one differ astound come human mindabs woke propaganda nonsensewhenev brows internet form griev thought woke propaganda contamin mind day day tri brainwash normal human mental idea delus make abnorm norm forcefeed outrag idea throat black myth wukong socal controversi take step closer root toxic masculin sexism lack divers pure journey rid bodi mind sens superior inferior represent divers abnorm delus nonsens game glori take us back root charact embark journey that noth noth less im yearsdecad comenegativesinvis wall implementationso one bit divis issu open world game implement invis wall featur block player area world inaccess ingam primarili help immers black myth wukong flawlessli make world entireti question area whatsoev enough imposs tell part world access one rare situat wherein player would realli benefit map least display gener area add fact map refer get annoy explor chest andor spiritsth reason might arguabl procon game compani get flack past year spoonfeed player go overli complic detail mapui im look ubisoft game like elden ring natur flow explor use map player gener idea black myth wukong took explor even higher level let player freedom want yet may argu case use clear invis wall might help ironicallyconclusionfin verdict anowaday game doesnt perfect even call superb worthi prais mani game drop ball fast hard tri stick polit agenda video game go greedi liveservic rout dont last month gamer may need touch grass sometim alway stupid braindead either custom base look buy product provid enjoymentth return singleplay game strong foundat lore gameplay believ put game industri map first place industri tri hand mani possibl path tri find perfect rout stabl era game titl like elden ring nioh ghost tsushima black myth wukong proven time time singl player actionrpg laid solid foundat path truli satisfi core audienc

I fell in love with the Soulsborne series when I first started playing Bloodborne on the PS4, after which I went out on a whim and bought myself Demon's Souls for PS3 as well as Dark Souls 1-3. I heard about this game a while ago, got hyped and pre-ordered as soon as I could before waiting a year to start the game. Having platinumed the game on PS5 and hoping to start on Steam someday in the future, here are my thoughts:The Story is one of those things that you just have to kind of explore and figure out by piecing together pieces of dialogue, item descriptions as well as environmental cues. I can't even tell you much of anything about it, but what I can say is like all FromSoft Souls titles, I love it. It keeps the goal simple: You're a Tarnished (an individual who was banned by the former queen from the Lands Between) who is going for the spot of Elden Lord and to do so has to fight through several different demigods in order to do so. You'll run into several characters via out in the world or the Hubworld, Roundtable Hold, who could do anything from basically nothing to giving you entire new endings. That's all I have to say for the plot:The Gameplay is basically almost the same as the other games in the Souls Series. You go from area to area to loot objects, fight bosses, complete particular quest lines for certain rewards, invade/fight enemy invaders except one caveat: It’s open world. And I mean it’s OPEN world. The other games were a lot more simplified as well as complex: they were a bit open in terms of pathways, shortcuts etc but they also had a straight way from point A to point B as well. In this game, everything is basically tenfold in terms of it’s game play design from how you get to certain areas to how to fight certain bosses. One example: In order to get to Leyendell there’s a couple different ways you can get to that region. One is you could ride up the Grand Lift of Dectus, where you need two halves of a medallion in which you can get each at Forth Haight and Fort Faroth. Another way you could do it is by going underneath a church near the Lift, going through a village and climbing up a mountain before killing the Magma Wyrm and getting up that way. ANOTHER way is to get killed/abducted at the bottom of the waterwheel in Raya Lucaria where you wake up in an area at Volcano Manor and fight your way out of the caves. Stuff like this is mindblowing and is amazing how much attention to detail and scope it took to truly create such a thing. And keep in mind this is only one example, I can’t list everything because truthfully, like this game, there’s so much stuff TO list that I’d be making a f u c king video essay on it. But also in essence I do think that can be to this game’s detriment as well: It’s so huge that it’s kind of overwhelming with its scale, and with that it can lose some of it’s uniqueness when you see multiple of the same bosses repeated over and over again with different skins. I also found the combat to be hard definitely, challenging is a yes, but I’m not sure if it’s just because I suck but I felt that now in this game it’s definitely more geared towards having summon spirits for boss combat? I’ve always been someone who liked to coop anyways so I’ve been cool with it but it can be kind of frustrating at times with certain bosses. I guess to finish this off just be aware that this game is difficult yes, but the community is great. Sure, are there a s sholes who will just tell you to “Get Gud'' and make believe they aren’t a bunch of basement dwelling pee larpers? Yes. But the amount of people who will go out of their way to help you for no reason other than why not is amazing. Just know in order to summon people: Get the Furlcalling Finger Remedy. They can be found as loot, crafted via Erdleaf Flowers, bought from certain merchants, etc. Also for certain places to be able to summon other players you have to activate summoning pools so keep a lookout for small statues.Sound Design/Art/Graphics; all of this is great and I’m not even sure I could expand upon it other than I don’t feel that the Soundtrack is as memorable as the other souls games? Either way it didn’t matter to me as it fit in the background and made everything memorable as I played even though when I got out of it I didn’t remember much. Still it looks great, the art design is amazing and graphics are good too.I can’t do justice to this game in a single Steam review, but if you’re new to the series or you wanna try it out just know this: Play fresh, wing it a bit and have fun, try not to get overwhelmed and experience EVERYTHING because it’s impossible (though it is possible to get all the trophies in one playthrough if that’s your thing). Research the game a bit, see what builds you want to go for (though your starting class does kind of gear you in certain ways so I’d say research BEFORE you start the game unless you just kinda want to wing it), farm a bit and upgrade your stats. But please god take breaks and take it at your own pace; because you will die and die and die some more and then die again; it can be a frustrating and strange loop but when it clicks with you it clicks with you. And if it doesn’t? That’s ok too and there’s no shame in it. Elden Ring is the culmination of all the things that FromSoft has done with the other Souls games and expanded upon it with great effect (and sometimes mixed results in certain things), but to me it certainly deserves the Game of the Year title.",elden ring action role play rpg gamepp crusher simul creat fromsoftwar explor open world land fight hard boss complet quest tri die fell love soulsborn seri first start play bloodborn went whim bought demon soul well dark soul heard game ago got hype preorder soon could wait year start game platinum game hope start steam someday futur thoughtsth stori one thing kind explor figur piec togeth piec dialogu item descript well environment cue cant even tell much anyth say like fromsoft soul titl love keep goal simpl your tarnish individu ban former queen land go spot elden lord fight sever differ demigod order youll run sever charact via world hubworld roundtabl hold could anyth basic noth give entir new end that say plotth gameplay basic almost game soul seri go area area loot object fight boss complet particular quest line certain reward invadefight enemi invad except one caveat open world mean open world game lot simplifi well complex bit open term pathway shortcut etc also straight way point point b well game everyth basic tenfold term game play design get certain area fight certain boss one exampl order get leyendel there coupl differ way get region one could ride grand lift dectu need two halv medallion get forth haight fort faroth anoth way could go underneath church near lift go villag climb mountain kill magma wyrm get way anoth way get killedabduct bottom waterwheel raya lucaria wake area volcano manor fight way cave stuff like mindblow amaz much attent detail scope took truli creat thing keep mind one exampl cant list everyth truth like game there much stuff list id make f u c king video essay also essenc think game detriment well huge kind overwhelm scale lose uniqu see multipl boss repeat differ skin also found combat hard definit challeng ye im sure suck felt game definit gear toward summon spirit boss combat ive alway someon like coop anyway ive cool kind frustrat time certain boss guess finish awar game difficult ye commun great sure shole tell get gud make believ arent bunch basement dwell pee larper ye amount peopl go way help reason amaz know order summon peopl get furlcal finger remedi found loot craft via erdleaf flower bought certain merchant etc also certain place abl summon player activ summon pool keep lookout small statuessound designartgraph great im even sure could expand upon dont feel soundtrack memor soul game either way didnt matter fit background made everyth memor play even though got didnt rememb much still look great art design amaz graphic good tooi cant justic game singl steam review your new seri wan na tri know play fresh wing bit fun tri get overwhelm experi everyth imposs though possibl get trophi one playthrough that thing research game bit see build want go though start class kind gear certain way id say research start game unless kinda want wing farm bit upgrad stat pleas god take break take pace die die die die frustrat strang loop click click doesnt that ok there shame elden ring culmin thing fromsoft done soul game expand upon great effect sometim mix result certain thing certainli deserv game year titl

"Product received for free it is really good overall, graphics are obviously amazing but tech-wise this game actually excels at mid-boss transitions with really polished animations, stunts and lots of tricky gimmicks in the second half of the campaigncombat is also great but imo it works better with bosses than mobs since what you ultimately do is build up focus points to spend on heavy attacks and thats more fun to do while dodging constantlylikewise story is nice cause as i said cutscenes are really polished and character interactions are interesting and zhu bajie has some funny quirks on him, but also you need some background in order to understand some of the bosses' struggles and such, i guess if youre familiar with journey to the west you might catch some more extra insighti also think this game does a fantastic job at portraying the chinese mythos and daoist iconography, some of the latter areas are really evocative and really makes you see how many faces buddha can have. For me personally this is excellent at portraying cultural background and a massive leap forward for the wuxia genrei think if they ever make a sequel it would benefit from some platforming elements and maybe a little more puzzle solving as the zones that connect each boss get a bit shallow sometimes by chapters 4 through 6performance is decent, i managed to run somewhat stable 60 fps on my rtx 3080 i9-10900k clocking at default speeds, it has frame generation options too even for non-nvidia graphics cards",product receiv free realli good overal graphic obvious amaz techwis game actual excel midboss transit realli polish anim stunt lot tricki gimmick second half campaigncombat also great imo work better boss mob sinc ultim build focu point spend heavi attack that fun dodg constantlylikewis stori nice caus said cutscen realli polish charact interact interest zhu baji funni quirk also need background order understand boss struggl guess your familiar journey west might catch extra insighti also think game fantast job portray chines mytho daoist iconographi latter area realli evoc realli make see mani face buddha person excel portray cultur background massiv leap forward wuxia genrei think ever make sequel would benefit platform element mayb littl puzzl solv zone connect boss get bit shallow sometim chapter decent manag run somewhat stabl fp rtx clock default speed frame gener option even nonnvidia graphic card

"Monke go bonk TLDR; It is pure action packed fun through and through. If you like hitting things and seeing the ""you defeated so and so"" then this is it. I went into this with no expectations at all. To be honest I had no idea what the game was till I heard about the records it was breaking.Well, to say the least I was extremely impressed. Glued to the game INSTANTLY. A blast of a game to play through. Every second was just beating the mess out of bosses, and oh man it is satisfying. Now there are some parts of the game that can be difficult. But overall it is a fun time to just sit down and just kill things. That Erlang fight is just. WOW. Just wow. Best fight in the entire game hands down. Worth doing it if you have not. The second stage of the fight were you play as the stone monkey it is just an amazing cinematography of fighting, special moves, etc. It is just awesome.Update: I ended up getting 100% in trophies. It was a fun time for the most part. Having to farm for some of the items felt like they just added it to add a moderate amount of extra playtime for no reason. I don't have a problem with farming but after 4.5 hours to get one item is a joke imo. Other than that it was a fun time fighting all the extra bosses and side quests I missed.",monk go bonk tldr pure action pack fun like hit thing see defeat went expect honest idea game till heard record breakingwel say least extrem impress glu game instantli blast game play everi second beat mess boss oh man satisfi part game difficult overal fun time sit kill thing erlang fight wow wow best fight entir game hand worth second stage fight play stone monkey amaz cinematographi fight special move etc awesomeupd end get trophi fun time part farm item felt like ad add moder amount extra playtim reason dont problem farm hour get one item joke imo fun time fight extra boss side quest miss

"2022 Wonderful at first, takes a nosedive once you start paying attention.If you're here to complain about me playing this game more after reviewing, someone in the comments pointed it out just fine: All the other souls games have no online features and I enjoy coop multiplayer. This game has gotten only worse the more I play it and I have finally uninstalled it. ♥♥♥♥ this piece of crap game.Honestly, my first 40 or so hours with this game were gorgeous. I loved riding around the open world on the horse just faffing about and seeing the sights, doing a small dungeon every now and then, and throwing myself at the first few main story bosses. Then as time went on things started to feel off. Bosses get copy pasted around, enemies get reused as mini dungeon bosses, mini dungeon bosses become ""normal"" enemies, and the further you get the more annoying the encounters become. Then it all culminates in Castle Sol, at which point my honeymoon phase with this game just crashed and burned ( although to be fair this was already starting around Leyndell), and I started to see this game for what it really is: A wonderful massive open world, filled with filler and copy pasted ♥♥♥♥♥, with too few enemy types and bosses to populate even half the areas, and encounter designs that remind me of Dark Souls 2, where killing you is more important than creating a challenge.Balancing in this game is whack, the areas rarely fit your character's level, and half the builds are simply not viable in the later game areas, which was especially disappointing since From games like these kinda stand on the whole ""choose your own build"" principle. The game seems to try to fix this by throwing handfuls of respec items at you... Bosses have chain attacks that hit-stun you longer than their pause between attacks, animations have unintuitive delays and very clear roll-catch feints that were already annoying me in DS3, there's some attacks that wind up so slowly you can attack a boss multiple times between the opening tell and the attack going off, and damage done by the late game bosses and enemies is so stupendous that leveling vigor is now as important as leveling ADP was in DS2. You either do it or you don't get to play the game. Late game encounters are also not enjoyable at all. The later areas are usually filled with enemy spam, summoning enemies, enemies that have infinite stamina and aggression, high poise and ridiculous damage. Enemies hiding around each and every corner, very powerful miniboss enemies grouped up with jobbers, enemies that are programmed to try to push you off ledges. All of the childish ""haha we killed you"" things, and in the end I would prefer just running past the reused enemies since fighting them was not going to benefit me at all.One of the things about this game that annoys me the most is how it subtly lies to you about its own design. Malenia's healing strikes also heal when she hits your shield, which is entirely counterintuitive to a mechanic like that which usually works like lifesteal, where she heals when she does damage. Mohg's curse can be negated by a wondrous physik tear except the tear barely works, and he still gets to heal most of his health and do some damage, and you can't roll through any of the curse animations. There's some Hero's dungeons that have dark phantom versions of enemies you need to lure onto seals of holy light to undo their invulnerability, except using holy attacks *doesn't work on them* (this is especially annoying as From is expected to pay attention to detail, and reward observant players) (Both the Phantom and chariot versions of the Hero's dungeons are awful btw), and the Godskin Duo fight pretends to be Throne Watcher & Defender, where if you kill one the other summons them back, except if you kill both in quick succession they just get summoned back anyways, without either of them needing to execute a summon animation. I feel like mentally engaging with this game is just a waste of effort and since this is a Fromsoft game that is *incredibly* disappointing.This game could have been wonderful, but it collapsed under its own scope. The map is so big, and they wanted to fill it with so many small dungeons and gaols and encounters that they ended up having to copy even main story bosses (Mohg, Astel, Godrick, Loretta gets used twice, so does Margit, and Morgott is just Margit with some extra moves, same for Niall and O'Neill) just to fill them with. It's embarrassing, and this game is nowhere near as good as you'll hear in general discourse about it.As a bit of a qualifier I will add: I have beaten all the main bosses (Including Malenia), collected all of the Great Runes, put god knows how many hours into this game, and think I have a pretty *okay* grasp on most of the boss's patterns and timings. I have beaten the final boss(es), and the only boss I used online coop to beat was the (actual) Mohg fight (the one with the curse of blood) since I was simply not going to deal with that ♥♥♥♥. I enjoy some things about this game. There are a few bosses that I find Magnificent. Radahn is one of the coolest thigns I've ever encountered (except they nerfed him for some reason...), Maliketh is an incredibly well designed boss, and lots of fun to fight, Godfrey and Radagon are also really good fights, and I still enjoy going back to help others fight them in coop, and I can safely say that I find the open world gorgeous to look at and still enjoy riding around it on the horse. Sadly the rest of the game exists around these good aspects, and drags everything down with it.----After thinking about it some more and reading some of the comments on this review I think I have some more thoughts to give. They are more on the technical and engine side of criticising the game. Since I'm running up against a character limit I will put them in a comment multiple comments to this review.",wonder first take nosed start pay attentionif your complain play game review someon comment point fine soul game onlin featur enjoy coop multiplay game gotten wors play final uninstal piec crap gamehonestli first hour game gorgeou love ride around open world hors faf see sight small dungeon everi throw first main stori boss time went thing start feel boss get copi past around enemi get reus mini dungeon boss mini dungeon boss becom normal enemi get annoy encount becom culmin castl sol point honeymoon phase game crash burn although fair alreadi start around leyndel start see game realli wonder massiv open world fill filler copi past enemi type boss popul even half area encount design remind dark soul kill import creat challengebalanc game whack area rare fit charact level half build simpli viabl later game area especi disappoint sinc game like kinda stand whole choos build principl game seem tri fix throw hand respec item boss chain attack hitstun longer paus attack anim unintuit delay clear rollcatch feint alreadi annoy there attack wind slowli attack boss multipl time open tell attack go damag done late game boss enemi stupend level vigor import level adp either dont get play game late game encount also enjoy later area usual fill enemi spam summon enemi enemi infinit stamina aggress high pois ridicul damag enemi hide around everi corner power miniboss enemi group jobber enemi program tri push ledg childish haha kill thing end would prefer run past reus enemi sinc fight go benefit allon thing game annoy subtli lie design malenia heal strike also heal hit shield entir counterintuit mechan like usual work like lifest heal damag mohg curs negat wondrou physik tear except tear bare work still get heal health damag cant roll curs anim there hero dungeon dark phantom version enemi need lure onto seal holi light undo invulner except use holi attack doesnt work especi annoy expect pay attent detail reward observ player phantom chariot version hero dungeon aw btw godskin duo fight pretend throne watcher defend kill one summon back except kill quick success get summon back anyway without either need execut summon anim feel like mental engag game wast effort sinc fromsoft game incred disappointingthi game could wonder collaps scope map big want fill mani small dungeon gaol encount end copi even main stori boss mohg astel godrick loretta get use twice margit morgott margit extra move niall oneil fill embarrass game nowher near good youll hear gener discours ita bit qualifi add beaten main boss includ malenia collect great rune put god know mani hour game think pretti okay grasp bosss pattern time beaten final boss boss use onlin coop beat actual mohg fight one curs blood sinc simpli go deal enjoy thing game boss find magnific radahn one coolest thign ive ever encount except nerf reason maliketh incred well design boss lot fun fight godfrey radagon also realli good fight still enjoy go back help other fight coop safe say find open world gorgeou look still enjoy ride around hors sadli rest game exist around good aspect drag everyth itaft think read comment review think thought give technic engin side criticis game sinc im run charact limit put comment multipl comment review

"2022 The game should be marketed as an ""early access"" version of TWWH3. Sure, CA will add mortal empires and DLC, but this is the shoddiest release of a Total War: Warhammer game yet. The number of crash-related bugs are extensive, and it took CA a month to release a beta branch that addressed the alt-tab crash problem. Unit rosters are well designed and most of the units feel like they're in a good spot, but the lack of a blood DLC makes factions like Ogres and Khorne feel a little on the lame side. I am eager to come back to this once Mortal Empires is created and to see what DLC CA has to cook up for this game, but the existing issues and frustrating mechanics in the Realm of Tzeentch make it seem like this product wasn't well polished.

Product received for free There are so many things to explore in this game which makes this game so addictive. The Concept and storyline are on the point. Even the missions you do won't bore you.My best part about this game is taking my bike and exploring new parts of the map aaannnnd catching Deviations which btw has its own ability that will either help you in your base or when you are in the battle.It is a very beautifully put-together game.

"NERDBONER!If you miss the mid 2000s games like Gear Of War you will love this one! No Coporate greed BS, no DEI, no ""suprise mechanics"", just big dudes killing big things. My updated review after completing the campagin on veteran and countless OP Missions: this is the best non-RTS 40K game out there at the moment! The last view fights of the campaign are the most 40K boner-material there is!!Gameplay: Art, graphics, music, atmosphere are top notch. Its war everywhere, like it should be, the weapons have a punch, gore is deliciously over the top. Campaign is a little repetitive during the first half, a problem the first game had too. The second half of the game is amazing with new enemies, guns, locations etc. Corporate greed/BS: No lootboxes, no microtransactions! Campaign can be played offline, OPs with bots.Bugs: During the campaign I had one animation bug. Multiplayer was great, I had some connection issues once but thats it.Balancing: The classes need finetuning in OP/MP, also some weapons.Difficulty: Played campaign on veteran. Its a challenge sometimes, the defense sections can be hard, but otherwise than that its doable.Multiplayer: Coop so far was VERY fun and this is where SM2 shines the most!Verdict so far: To my knowledge everything is lore accurate, they went into great detail in this one. Big dudes with bigger weapons killing stuff, this is what I want to see! If you know 40K you will love this game, its a love letter to all the fans!PAIN DEEPENS DEVOTION!",nerdbonerif miss mid game like gear war love one copor greed bs dei supris mechan big dude kill big thing updat review complet campagin veteran countless op mission best nonrt game moment last view fight campaign bonermateri isgameplay art graphic music atmospher top notch war everywher like weapon punch gore delici top campaign littl repetit first half problem first game second half game amaz new enemi gun locat etc corpor greedb lootbox microtransact campaign play offlin op botsbug campaign one anim bug multiplay great connect issu that itbalanc class need finetun opmp also weaponsdifficulti play campaign veteran challeng sometim defens section hard otherwis doablemultiplay coop far fun shine mostverdict far knowledg everyth lore accur went great detail one big dude bigger weapon kill stuff want see know love game love letter fanspain deepen devot
"Sadly cannot recommend the game in the state that it is in.

With improvements to nearly every aspect of the original, this highly anticipated sequel seeks to push the threshold of third-person shooters with high-octane action sequences balanced with an intensive story set in the annals of Warhammer.🟩 Positives🟥 Negatives🟩 An impressively well-written storyline with dedication to the core material, brimming with action, and twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat.🟩 Fun, intuitive gunplay that diversely changes between each gun type and their variants, offering you plenty of choices on the battlefield.🟩 A large variety of enemies to combat against drastically altering the tactics required to overcome them.🟩 Some of the best visual standards in gaming to date. This is truly an aesthetic dream, especially if you're a fan of Warhammer and appreciate the franchise design.🟩 The audio is of a similarly high quality. A passionate team has designed the perfect sound effects, soundtrack and general ambience to bring this world to life as you explore its vast maps.🟥 While the gunplay is clean, traversing the battlefield, especially on higher difficulties, can become burdensome as you take a lot of damage with few options for cover.🟥 The friendly AI is nearly useless. Sometimes standing in the middle of intense gunfights aimlessly looking around, while you take all of the enemy's attention.StoryOne century after the events of Space Marine, Demetrian Titus returns to active service with his chapter, The Ultramarines. Having spent the last hundred years serving in the Deathwatch as a Black Shield, his return is met with suspicion and hostility, but the growing threat of the Tyranids must take priority. With bolter in hand and his brothers at his side, nothing shall stand in the way as a story of deception, intrigue, and loyalty unfolds before the falsely disgraced former Captain. The Ultramarines are aligned. A Screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 By: Preator A truly well-thought-out and designed storyline unravels at a relaxed pace as you traverse the enormous levels brimming with plot and entices you to take one more step until hours have passed without your notice. It is a genuinely intriguing story set in an enormous world that makes me want to learn more and delve deeper into the franchise.Gameplay AnalysisWithout the dark, there can be no light.Space Marine 2, at its core, is a third-person action shooter, so naturally the essence of the game is gunplay and movement.The gunplay has been expertly thought-out to deliver clean, streamlined accessibility to loads of different guns and the ability to use them intuitively on the go. The arsenal available is substantial and provides plenty of unique gameplay mechanics that can vastly change between each type, and understanding their strengths and weaknesses is essential for progression, but there are so many choices and moments where you get to make them that you won't likely be stuck with a mistake for long.The movement has also taken a massive quality of life improvement from the original, and while the Space Marines feel realistically heavy, they carry their weight well and can throw it around quite effortlessly and effectively. This makes movement a way to traverse the battlefield but also a weapon on its own. My only issue is that there is no way to take cover or crouch behind what cover is available, which often means you will get incapacitated quickly on the more challenging difficulties.Without the lie, there can be no truth.In addition to the lengthy campaign, you have a couple of other game modes to participate in, which vastly extend the playability.Operations mode is secondary objective missions that parallel the primary campaign and allow you to choose classes to undertake them. These reward you with customisations and experience points varying for the difficulty you choose. The assault begins. A Screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 By: Preator Eternal War is the player vs player mode in this game where you again get to choose the class you want to play, but you pit your skills against other players in the world for the glory of the Emperor.Space Marine 2 is highly cooperative in its design, allowing players to pretty much do all of the activities in the game with other players. I played most of it solo, but I genuinely enjoyed the cooperative experience because it allowed me to do it at my leisure.Without war, there can be no victory.Because there is such an expansive amount of content to play through there is a literal plethora of unlockable customisations in the game for you to unlock and discover through exploration.Every class has a perk tree that requires mission completions and matches to be completed to gain levels to attain them and each weapon has its own mastery and perk tree as well. This vastly increases capability allowing you to tackle harder missions and in turn, earn even better rewards. I was genuinely impressed by the sheer volume of unlockables available, from specialty armour types and chapter paints to decals and accessories to help make the Space Marine your own.Audio and VisualSpace Marine 2 is hands-down one of the most aesthetically pleasing games I've ever experienced. The minor and major details in this game left me awe-stricken many times over and the general visual ambience and environments just captivate both heart and imagination. With a fairly inclusive photo mode available as well, you could spend hours just playing with that feature alone. Aesthetics at their finest. A Screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 By: Preator The audio is also of sensational quality. A clear effort has been made to create immersive audio for animations, and environments as well as the sound of how visceral the game can be when you're hacking into the enemies or prying away flesh from bone. Truly one of the most gratifying experiences in gaming.Performance and Specifications🟧 The game isn't without its flaws however, it is a hungry powerhouse for resources and running it at Ultra, I was able to hit a consistent 60 FPS at 2560 x 1440 but that's with significant dips from my FPS cap of 90.🟨 I also had some severe crashing on day one, but that passed relatively quickly and the game hasn't crashed since.RAM: 32GB 3200GHz G-Skill (DDR4)CPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz GPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080Final Thoughts - ExcellentReview chart here.I am far from a veteran fan of Warhammer, but having played both of the Space Marine games now I am invested in the universe and want to expand my knowledge of the world, and I think that is where this game truly shines. Not only is it a grandiose and beautiful experience in an enormous universe of story and intrigue, but it's a great entry point for beginners and while I recommend you play 1 first because they are directly connected, I don't think it necessary and can be played as an entirely individual experience. Highly recommend this game even at full price. A truly spectacular game that deserves all the high praise it's receiving and then some.We will take the fight to the heretics, but first, let's head to, Hell, Purgatory and Paradise to gain the blessing of the Emperor for the battle ahead.",lifemi honour lifewhat fatemi duti fatewhat fearmi fear failwhat rewardmi salvat rewardwhat craftmi craft deathwhat pledgemi pledg etern serviceintroductionspac marin direct sequel promin acclaim game improv nearli everi aspect origin highli anticip sequel seek push threshold thirdperson shooter highoctan action sequenc balanc intens stori set annal warhamm posit neg impress wellwritten storylin dedic core materi brim action twist turn keep edg seat fun intuit gunplay divers chang gun type variant offer plenti choic battlefield larg varieti enemi combat drastic alter tactic requir overcom best visual standard game date truli aesthet dream especi your fan warhamm appreci franchis design audio similarli high qualiti passion team design perfect sound effect soundtrack gener ambienc bring world life explor vast map gunplay clean travers battlefield especi higher difficulti becom burdensom take lot damag option cover friendli ai nearli useless sometim stand middl intens gunfight aimlessli look around take enemi attentionstoryon centuri event space marin demetrian titu return activ servic chapter ultramarin spent last hundr year serv deathwatch black shield return met suspicion hostil grow threat tyranid must take prioriti bolter hand brother side noth shall stand way stori decept intrigu loyalti unfold fals disgrac former captain ultramarin align screenshot warhamm space marin preator truli wellthoughtout design storylin unravel relax pace travers enorm level brim plot entic take one step hour pass without notic genuin intrigu stori set enorm world make want learn delv deeper franchisegameplay analysiswithout dark lightspac marin core thirdperson action shooter natur essenc game gunplay movementth gunplay expertli thoughtout deliv clean streamlin access load differ gun abil use intuit go arsen avail substanti provid plenti uniqu gameplay mechan vastli chang type understand strength weak essenti progress mani choic moment get make wont like stuck mistak longth movement also taken massiv qualiti life improv origin space marin feel realist heavi carri weight well throw around quit effortlessli effect make movement way travers battlefield also weapon issu way take cover crouch behind cover avail often mean get incapacit quickli challeng difficultieswithout lie truthin addit lengthi campaign coupl game mode particip vastli extend playabilityoper mode secondari object mission parallel primari campaign allow choos class undertak reward customis experi point vari difficulti choos assault begin screenshot warhamm space marin preator etern war player vs player mode game get choos class want play pit skill player world glori emperorspac marin highli cooper design allow player pretti much activ game player play solo genuin enjoy cooper experi allow leisurewithout war victorybecaus expans amount content play liter plethora unlock customis game unlock discov explorationeveri class perk tree requir mission complet match complet gain level attain weapon masteri perk tree well vastli increas capabl allow tackl harder mission turn earn even better reward genuin impress sheer volum unlock avail specialti armour type chapter paint decal accessori help make space marin ownaudio visualspac marin handsdown one aesthet pleas game ive ever experienc minor major detail game left awestricken mani time gener visual ambienc environ captiv heart imagin fairli inclus photo mode avail well could spend hour play featur alon aesthet finest screenshot warhamm space marin preator audio also sensat qualiti clear effort made creat immers audio anim environ well sound viscer game your hack enemi pri away flesh bone truli one gratifi experi gamingperform specif game isnt without flaw howev hungri powerhous resourc run ultra abl hit consist fp x that signific dip fp cap also sever crash day one pass rel quickli game hasnt crash sinceram gskill gpu msi ventu rtx thought excellentreview chart herei far veteran fan warhamm play space marin game invest univers want expand knowledg world think game truli shine grandios beauti experi enorm univers stori intrigu great entri point beginn recommend play first directli connect dont think necessari play entir individu experi highli recommend game even full price truli spectacular game deserv high prais receiv somew take fight heret first let head hell purgatori paradis gain bless emperor battl ahead
"Feels very shallow, meaning the stuff you collect you don't really feel attached to. For a player that likes the destiny grind this might be a good survival version for you, personally Id rather be playing rust than this game. Mostly because in rust if someone stands outside my base hurling slurs or insults I can shoot them... Even in PVP the other player seemingly has to flag and cant even do so before level 11.Community is toxic already, and big groups are forming. I dont know what raiding looks like, however Im not interested in dumping hundreds of hours into it to find out a zerg raided my base. Again, Rust did that better, you can rebuild much easier in a NON RPG game like Rust.Servers seem to be running fine, but I think Ive only seen about 30 people running around in the 7th pvp server.Its very possible to troll people in this game as well. Just standing where they want to build or on the mic with no repercussions in game (Im not a softie COD lobby is always funny to me, but if I cant shoot them wheres the fun?)",feel shallow mean stuff collect dont realli feel attach player like destini grind might good surviv version person id rather play rust game mostli rust someon stand outsid base hurl slur insult shoot even pvp player seemingli flag cant even level toxic alreadi big group form dont know raid look like howev im interest dump hundr hour find zerg raid base rust better rebuild much easier non rpg game like rustserv seem run fine think ive seen peopl run around pvp serverit possibl troll peopl game well stand want build mic repercuss game im softi cod lobbi alway funni cant shoot where fun

"2019 Let me clear this out, as a person who has kinda a lot of experience on the game, I can say u that every country has their stereotype on this game. This game can make the most normal person in the world into a raging toxic machine who is flaming everybody and gets depressed after losing one round.So let me start on the stereotypes:Russian/Poland/Ukraine people: Oh boy where I can start. Very self driven and they not care about you and they can f*** up with your head just by speaking their language even if u asked them something in english, skill wise they suck, there are some good russian/polish/ukraine players but its rare to find them if you do you're lucky. Chances are low to kick them beacuse they go premade with friends just not to get kicked beacuse they know they suck.British people: The most arrogant people out there you can't argue with them never ever even when you have a point they will still switch it up and they will not care about your opinion, they will always say your english sucks beacuse english is their main language. Skill wise I must say by my experience one of the most skilled ones, but it can happen you find a bad player from Britain but chances are low.French/German/Belgium/Spanish/Holland/Italian people: They are the most normal ones, if u flame them they will flame you back, but in most situations they are normal and chill, skill wise its a 50/50 chance a good or bad player will come, beacuse the normal ones are mostly the avarage players.Turkish people: A better version of the Russians, they can't speak english well, they kinda suck, but they're special beacuse if u found out somebody is cheating on the enemy team I can guarantee you that the cheater is 80% from Turkey and he's playing with his Turkish friends on full stack. There are some good players, but chances are low to find them just like the Russian ones. They love Dust and they can't play any other map.Balkan people: There's everything in them toxicity, skill everything you can think of. Guys older than 20 from the Balkans are mostly chill and very good at the game. But the under 20 like me, oh boy watch yourself, the young ones are skillful, but they're very toxic, but they're not self driven just like the Brits, they know who's better than them and who's worse than them and they will listen to the ones with more experience. Balkan people also are not that patient they can lose their cool when you do something stupid even if you're winning so watch out.Swedish/Norway/Finland/Denmark: I don't really know what to say about them 80% are chill and very friendly but the rest 20% are the most toxic ones, skill wise they are great, for me the best in the world but the 20% I mentioned are the biggest noobs getting carried by their friends. They communicate great and are the most chill ones. I'm not a person who can judge but this is from my perspective, so if you read this don't feel offended it's a personal opinion.The game would be good if the anti_cheat was better. The problem with CS:GO is the more you hate it the more you love it. But the game is good tho.",let clear person kinda lot experi game say u everi countri stereotyp game game make normal person world rage toxic machin flame everybodi get depress lose one roundso let start stereotypesrussianpolandukrain peopl oh boy start self driven care f head speak languag even u ask someth english skill wise suck good russianpolishukrain player rare find your lucki chanc low kick beacus go premad friend get kick beacus know suckbritish peopl arrog peopl cant argu never ever even point still switch care opinion alway say english suck beacus english main languag skill wise must say experi one skill one happen find bad player britain chanc lowfrenchgermanbelgiumspanishhollanditalian peopl normal one u flame flame back situat normal chill skill wise chanc good bad player come beacus normal one mostli avarag playersturkish peopl better version russian cant speak english well kinda suck theyr special beacus u found somebodi cheat enemi team guarante cheater turkey he play turkish friend full stack good player chanc low find like russian one love dust cant play mapbalkan peopl there everyth toxic skill everyth think guy older balkan mostli chill good game like oh boy watch young one skill theyr toxic theyr self driven like brit know who better who wors listen one experi balkan peopl also patient lose cool someth stupid even your win watch outswedishnorwayfinlanddenmark dont realli know say chill friendli rest toxic one skill wise great best world mention biggest noob get carri friend commun great chill one im person judg perspect read dont feel offend person opinionth game would good anticheat better problem csgo hate love game good tho

"I can’t recommend the game for $60, sadly. Yes, it’s really beautiful graphics-wise, but there’s not much content in the game. It only took me 6.5 hours on the third hardest difficulty to complete. Also, for a solo experience, it’s really difficult because the two AI companions you get don’t do anything and don’t seem to get any of the aggro from the enemy. The difficulty drops off hard after Act 1 because the new enemy you fight also has bad AI, and their main guys often just stand still for you to hit them, breaking immersion.After the main story is over, it kind of devolves into a grind fest for cosmetics that just add purity seals or different colors for your armor. Very few change how it looks in terms of form. The Chaos marines in PvP also have no different armor options to my knowledge. Although the Eternal war mode (PvP) was fun, I find it hard to say it's worth $60.As a side note, it WILL overheat your CPU. I was running it at 103°C when I noticed it was getting hot. Other users online are experiencing this, so if you do too, I recommend you look up a settings guide; that fixed it for me.TL;DR: Not enough content/Grindy with little reward/Not good enough customization.

"So far, this is my game of the decade (Space Marine 2 is around the corner tho).Incredible combat, incredible soundtrack, incredible graphics, runs super smoothly and its hella fun.Just a heads-up: this game wasn't made to appeal to western audiences specifically, there will be a loooot of stuff flying over your head if you're not familiar with the Journey to the West novel, which I find very silly for reviewers to complain about. It's very egotistical to assume every game has to be specifically made with you in mind.There's plenty of 10-15 minutes videos on youtube giving a quick recap of the original novel with all the essential info to fully enjoy the game, I highly recommend watching any of those before playing the game (the novel is really cool anyway, so it's not like it will be a slog to sit through)",far game decad space marin around corner thoincred combat incred soundtrack incred graphic run super smoothli hella funjust headsup game wasnt made appeal western audienc specif loooot stuff fli head your familiar journey west novel find silli review complain egotist assum everi game specif made mindther plenti minut video youtub give quick recap origin novel essenti info fulli enjoy game highli recommend watch play game novel realli cool anyway like slog sit
"2023 In its current state, I cannot recommend this game. It's been well over a year since release, and the game is absolutely plagued by bugs. Patches are infrequent and lackluster, Creative Assembly seems to be happy to churn out overpriced DLC rather than fixing the content that's already paid for.I've been a Total War fan since 2005, with more than 1000 hours on the previous title.

"2023 The replayability on this game is astounding - and its really fun to play with friends. Now, buying all the requisite base-games is costly (and all the Skaven related DLC) unless you are getting it on a Steam sale - but that's nothing new.Earlier this year, CA released a DLC called ""Forge of the Chaos Dwarves,"" an ALL NEW race with neat new mechanics and units, consisting of 3 legendary lords. It was well received by basically all and launched with minimal (or next to 0) issues - it is by far one of my fav factions to play, personally. It cost $25. Now, CA's Executives and Board are releasing a lord pack, ""Shadows of Change,"" and it simply doesn't stack up based on the value proposition that they themselves have established with the Chaos Dwarves DLC. ""Shadows"" is the same price, but includes NO new races, and NO revolution in mechanics, and very FEW new units. Apparently the Kislev lord is also bugged to the point of unplayability. I'm not getting Shadows of Change, because it doesn't live up to the value proposition that CA itself established earlier this year... Total War is CA's biggest property, but instead of ""training their strengths"" by giving TW:Warhammer the time and attention the game needs, the Executives and Board are clearly plowing Total War profits into their derivative Fort-Valerant clone and inevitable failure of a game called ""Hyenas."" Pathetic.CA Executives and Board members are clearly a bunch of out-of-touch hacks who know nothing of business. Do they not know that chasing after ""other audiences"" to the detriment of your core products has not worked for any entertainment company - from modern cinema (writ large), to Netflix, to Disney. Are they paying attention? Do they think they are better positioned then multi-billion dollar entertainment companies who have failed at the same gamble? Games Workshop needs to revisit this partnership, and read the CA Board the riot act, or else risk the poisoning of a massive on-ramp to GW's own IP. So, I come back to what I said in the first line of this review. The replayability of this game is amazing. Therefore, I don't need this new crap DLC to make, and to keep, this game fun for me and my friends. So, I won't be buying anything from CA AT LEAST until their garbage secondary product ""Hyenas"" launches and subsequently fails.",replay game astound realli fun play friend buy requisit basegam costli skaven relat dlc unless get steam sale that noth newearli year ca releas dlc call forg chao dwarv new race neat new mechan unit consist legendari lord well receiv basic launch minim next issu far one fav faction play person cost ca execut board releas lord pack shadow chang simpli doesnt stack base valu proposit establish chao dwarv dlc shadow price includ new race revolut mechan new unit appar kislev lord also bug point unplay im get shadow chang doesnt live valu proposit ca establish earlier year total war ca biggest properti instead train strength give twwarhamm time attent game need execut board clearli plow total war profit deriv fortvaler clone inevit failur game call hyena patheticca execut board member clearli bunch outoftouch hack know noth busi know chase audienc detriment core product work entertain compani modern cinema writ larg netflix disney pay attent think better posit multibillion dollar entertain compani fail gambl game workshop need revisit partnership read ca board riot act els risk poison massiv onramp gw ip come back said first line review replay game amaz therefor dont need new crap dlc make keep game fun friend wont buy anyth ca least garbag secondari product hyena launch subsequ fail

"TLDR: It was fun for a time. I'm not recommending it because of the wipe mechanic. Yes, I read what you keep and what you don't. It's still a wipe, you still lose stuff. Now there's nerfs for PvE because PvP and lootboxes so I'm done till they add private servers or a single player option. There is a 'soft' wipe. They move everything to 'Eternaland' and then you can pick a choose some things to bring into the next scenario and reset you back to level one when you move to next scenario. You keep blueprints, mods, weapon accessories, cosmetics, the special currencies. A lot of people still want to keep all their stuff and just jump into the scenario but so far it seems the devs are very against that and keep pushing the 'Eternaland' stuff. PvP wipes make sense, PvE wipes are just a waste of time. I still continued to play hoping there'd be a change. And now there's some ranching in the game and you'll lose those animals too so what's the point.I haven't done combat since the new August 15th patch but reading the patch notes, they've nerfed some things and seems mainly to balance PvP but that affects PvE too, which is a majority of the playerbase. So imagine spending weeks of earned Starchrom currency to have your build nerfed the last bit of the scenario because of a part of the game that you don't even participate in. Lootboxes. They are cosmetic only. However, I find lootboxes in any games predatory. It's gambling. It's RNG. People are getting duplicates all the time and you can only open 150 boxes. So people can spend all that money (a box is 150 premium currency), and still not get the fancy skin bike. Just put the items directly in the shop.",tldr fun time im recommend wipe mechan ye read keep dont still wipe still lose stuff there nerf pve pvp lootbox im done till add privat server singl player option soft wipe move everyth eternaland pick choos thing bring next scenario reset back level one move next scenario keep blueprint mod weapon accessori cosmet special currenc lot peopl still want keep stuff jump scenario far seem dev keep push eternaland stuff pvp wipe make sens pve wipe wast time still continu play hope there chang there ranch game youll lose anim what pointi havent done combat sinc new august patch read patch note theyv nerf thing seem mainli balanc pvp affect pve major playerbas imagin spend week earn starchrom currenc build nerf last bit scenario part game dont even particip lootbox cosmet howev find lootbox game predatori gambl rng peopl get duplic time open box peopl spend money box premium currenc still get fanci skin bike put item directli shop

2022 69 hours in (lol noice!) with very heavy exploration of the first few areas and the map and secrets just do not seem to end. There is always a new area to go to. There is always an NPC putting you up to some obscure questline.I caught a glimpse of the actual map from wiki and I have around 40-50% of the map yet to uncover. And some of the best areas and bosses of the game are entirely optional and some are even hidden behind highly obscure questlines which you can 100% miss.I am simply lost for words trying to explain just how magnificent the map design is. This is like they took the map design from dark souls 1 and cranked it up to 10000 on steroids.This game is sheer insanity in terms of how beautiful it is and how fun it is(if you like souls games atleast).This is truly a generational title and should be on everybody's wishlist.Rating - Masterpiece/10,hour lol noic heavi explor first area map secret seem end alway new area go alway npc put obscur questlinei caught glimps actual map wiki around map yet uncov best area boss game entir option even hidden behind highli obscur questlin missi simpli lost word tri explain magnific map design like took map design dark soul crank steroidsthi game sheer insan term beauti fun isif like soul game atleastthi truli gener titl everybodi wishlistr

"EDIT: Have to change to a negative review unfortunately. The Devs said during a stream yesterday that there aren’t enough OCE players playing to justify making a new server. Not sure what they what server they thought the OCE players would be playing on. Very disappointing as the gameplay is fun, but any mid-late game content will be impossible with this ping. Will revisit this review if they ever support Aussies playing their game. ORIGINAL POSITIVE REVIEW: Awesome game. Feels like the love child of the division, monster hunter, rust and new world. Unfortunately no OCE servers, so getting 115-145 ping in Australia. Hoping that they get us a PvP and PvE server quickly before the Aussie players move on to another game.I have only seen negative reviews about issues that have been fixed or addressed.

"Whats my brief summary of Warhammer 40K: Space Marines 2?Uh...well...There's Space marinesLoading screens And buggy cutscenes...Oh and chainswords.... Mother F*cking C H A I N S W O R D S ! In all seriousness yeah its an alright enough game with a short but decent campaign (albeit some aforementioned cutscene errors or bugs such as where they either freeze but the audio continues or its the opposite of the audio lagging behind the visuals of a cutscene). Combats fun allowing you to pull off some cool as finishers to enemies to regain health and shields (finishing moves in action games is always a win) but some of the controls can feel quite janky with awkward keybinds set by the game for pc. The operations co-op mode currently has an error where you can get stuck in the hub after readying up for a level and would certainly benefit from some variety, otherwise the same 6 levels could get repetitive for some people, I like to think of it like its Left 4 Dead where you can play through the same levels countless times but the game play is what keeps it fun, but some more random/less linear objectives if possible could probably help make the levels feel less repetitive. With hopefully some more content and additions operations mode can hopefully reach just a bit more of the potential that it does offer, but still simply just co-op romping with some friends or random allies and curb stomping aliens together are fun solid foundations, hopefully it can just be improved upon.There's a PVP multiplayer mode where you play as the space marines faction or the Chaos marine (evil hellish marines) faction and fight each other. I haven't played much of it myself but yeah its alright, its there for those who want it. You can't unfortunately customise the Chaos faction characters, you get premade models for each of the classes on that side, which while they do look cool themselves, does seam like some people are still let down that you can't customise them as well like you can with the space marines. As far as I've seen theres not many like cool takedowns or anything you can do to enemy players, its just clunky space marines on both sides blasting or thwacking each other clumsily like its a call of duty game and using their ultimate abilities non-stop with no cohesion to see who dies first, then respawning with your abilities charged again to rush back into the fight and repeat the process. Yeah its alright for those who may like the PVP stuff but personally I think the PVE stuff's more the games strong point. Both the Co-op mode and PVP mode have separate level progressions though so don't think you can level up a class in co-op mode then pop into PVP with a skilled up PVE dude and stomp fools, which is fair BUT however, while class level progression is separate for each mode. You can still unlock cosmetics currency and armour pieces for your characters just by completing matches in both modes as each character. So you can still play both modes and they still count for cosmetic progress at least for each class you beat a match as, so thats nice.Yeah look, TLDR: Its a decent co-op game and being able to run around and stomp out enemies with allies while playing as giant f*ck off power armoured boys is still awesome. Heck I'm not a big Warhammer series fan myself meaning I knew bugger all about the lore, but I am starting to learn some things about the universe by playing this game and its encouraged me to look a bit more into it. And you don't need to be a fan of the franchise or know everything to enjoy the game, I'm a simple fella, I saw big mech suits, chainsaws and brutally ripping alien scum to shreads... and thats all I wanted from it. So its still a solid cool game to play and have fun wreaking havoc on enemies with your big space marine ruthlessness and brutality. But I think it would benefit from some more additions and content, the foundation is there, just build on it and add more levels, and maybe some variety in objectives to keep the co-op mode from becoming stale. P.S The Season Pass content cosmetics have been a bit disappointing so far, Its just more colours and decals really, I was hoping for more unique/cool and actual standout armour pieces or such to justify its content but so far it leaves alot to be desired IMO.",what brief summari warhamm space marin space marinesload screen buggi cutscenesoh chainsword mother fcking c h n w r serious yeah alright enough game short decent campaign albeit aforement cutscen error bug either freez audio continu opposit audio lag behind visual cutscen combat fun allow pull cool finish enemi regain health shield finish move action game alway win control feel quit janki awkward keybind set game pc oper coop mode current error get stuck hub readi level would certainli benefit varieti otherwis level could get repetit peopl like think like left dead play level countless time game play keep fun randomless linear object possibl could probabl help make level feel less repetit hope content addit oper mode hope reach bit potenti offer still simpli coop romp friend random alli curb stomp alien togeth fun solid foundat hope improv uponther pvp multiplay mode play space marin faction chao marin evil hellish marin faction fight havent play much yeah alright want cant unfortun customis chao faction charact get premad model class side look cool seam like peopl still let cant customis well like space marin far ive seen there mani like cool takedown anyth enemi player clunki space marin side blast thwack clumsili like call duti game use ultim abil nonstop cohes see die first respawn abil charg rush back fight repeat process yeah alright may like pvp stuff person think pve stuff game strong point coop mode pvp mode separ level progress though dont think level class coop mode pop pvp skill pve dude stomp fool fair howev class level progress separ mode still unlock cosmet currenc armour piec charact complet match mode charact still play mode still count cosmet progress least class beat match that niceyeah look tldr decent coop game abl run around stomp enemi alli play giant fck power armour boy still awesom heck im big warhamm seri fan mean knew bugger lore start learn thing univers play game encourag look bit dont need fan franchis know everyth enjoy game im simpl fella saw big mech suit chainsaw brutal rip alien scum shread that want still solid cool game play fun wreak havoc enemi big space marin ruthless brutal think would benefit addit content foundat build add level mayb varieti object keep coop mode becom stale ps season pass content cosmet bit disappoint far colour decal realli hope uniquecool actual standout armour piec justifi content far leav alot desir imo

"2022 The world of Elden Ring it's very mesmerizing, very mysterious, but also dangerous. When I played, I finally had the feeling of ""I'm going to an adventure"", and the last time I felt that way was back in Dark Souls 3. The open world it's fantastic and everything it's build with care and attention with tons of different things to either discover or fight. At this moment I have 853 photos that I took through my gameplay and I usually either forget to take photos in game, or take them to a minimum level. I'm amazed about what they built with the same ENGINE and how much depth and details they put into their work, some photos that I took I can even put them as background for my PC, because they look so good and clean. Every single zone from Limgrave to the final zone Farum it's incredible, filled with so much details, everything has it's own identity, which I personally like it to the very end.---The story of the game is ""simple"", yet complex when you put every single piece of information gathered either through dialogue with NPCs, quests or by exploring. In this game, YOU are a Tarnished, once banished for losing the blessing of the Grace and now recalled back with other Tarnished after the Shattering, in The Lands Between to recover the Great Runes, restore the Elden Ring and become the next Elden Lord.What I like about the games made by FromSoftware? They never handhold you, or at least they are doing that to a minimum level. It's an open world, you're free to explore, to do whatever you want. But because it's an open world don't expect to fight the end game enemies fast. What you should take in consideration when you play Elden Ring: Sites of grace are your compass, they tell you where the Shard bearers are and where to go next. If you follow them, be assured that you will not get lost, but at the same time don't forget to explore the vast world and meet the other Tarnished (NPCs) Elden Ring is not linear as the other past games made by FromSoftware. New players or even veterans, that got used to the old mechanics, don't understand that freedom might be also your biggest enemy. If you explore and reach a zone where you get overwhelmed and destroyed by monster, don't get upsate that it's unfair, just keep in mind you come back later after you got strong and far into the story. I got teleported to Caelid because of a trap chest and I wondered why I wasn't doing that much damage, but I knew that later on I will be fine. As I said previously you have freedom which is your friend and at the same time your enemy. The world is vast and filled with secrets, dungeons, mini-bosses and items. Don't be afraid to discover them, you might discover a spell or weapon that you will like it and presumably will make you stronger. Listen to what NPCs have to say. They will tell you where you will meet them in the future, EXPECT that you will meet them. Don't get mad that you lost a quest, or did something bad, learn what you did wrong, plan what to do in your next journey when you finish the game. Use every resource you have to your own advantage. Read the messages that other players left behind, some might help you, some might not, and some are wrote just for fun, but they are there. Miyazaki wants the community to help each others, that's why there are messages. Use steam forums, ask for help, ASK YOUR FRIENDS, if you want you can take a glimpse at a guide on the internet on what to do with a specific NPC, quest, as it's not something to be ashamed about, everyone is doing mistakes, and everyone is hitting a wall sometimes. You did a mistake with an NPC in your run, but I will do better in my next one. JUST DO IT! Use the map! Pin your NPC, resources, ANYTHING! A boss is hard? You spent 1,5 hours trying to beat it? (Looking at you Valiant Gargoyles) You have many options: request help, play with friends, use summon ashes, find a suitable Ash of War for that fight. The AI of monsters, mini-bosses, bosses is learning from your moves and mistakes. Unlike the past souls games, in Elden Ring you might get overwhelmed by a long series of fast attacks or even insta kills. Learn from your mistakes, hone your skills, it's possible to beat it!",world elden ring mesmer mysteri also danger play final feel im go adventur last time felt way back dark soul open world fantast everyth build care attent ton differ thing either discov fight moment photo took gameplay usual either forget take photo game take minimum level im amaz built engin much depth detail put work photo took even put background pc look good clean everi singl zone limgrav final zone farum incred fill much detail everyth ident person like endth stori game simpl yet complex put everi singl piec inform gather either dialogu npc quest explor game tarnish banish lose bless grace recal back tarnish shatter land recov great rune restor elden ring becom next elden lordwhat like game made fromsoftwar never handhold least minimum level open world your free explor whatev want open world dont expect fight end game enemi fast take consider play elden ring site grace compass tell shard bearer go next follow assur get lost time dont forget explor vast world meet tarnish npc elden ring linear past game made fromsoftwar new player even veteran got use old mechan dont understand freedom might also biggest enemi explor reach zone get overwhelm destroy monster dont get upsat unfair keep mind come back later got strong far stori got teleport caelid trap chest wonder wasnt much damag knew later fine said previous freedom friend time enemi world vast fill secret dungeon miniboss item dont afraid discov might discov spell weapon like presum make stronger listen npc say tell meet futur expect meet dont get mad lost quest someth bad learn wrong plan next journey finish game use everi resourc advantag read messag player left behind might help might wrote fun miyazaki want commun help other that messag use steam forum ask help ask friend want take glimps guid internet specif npc quest someth asham everyon mistak everyon hit wall sometim mistak npc run better next one use map pin npc resourc anyth boss hard spent hour tri beat look valiant gargoyl mani option request help play friend use summon ash find suitabl ash war fight ai monster miniboss boss learn move mistak unlik past soul game elden ring might get overwhelm long seri fast attack even insta kill learn mistak hone skill possibl beat

"2022 GREAT GAME!!NOT CO-OP. so yeah. I absolutely love the game and reccommend it for single player. But not Co-op. It is not co-op and never really will be unless the devs open the entire world for co-op and not require you to farm a bunch of flowers to re summon your friend. They will also need to allow you to play your character fully in your friends world . Nor is it an ""online"" multiplayer game too. I really love the game but i feel this needs to be clarified that this is in no way a co-op game, you literally can only show up for bosses, and if you wish to continuously play with a friend, you will need a pile of summoning materials. 10-10 would reccommend for single player, and NOT for multiplayer.",great gamenot coop yeah absolut love game reccommend singl player coop coop never realli unless dev open entir world coop requir farm bunch flower summon friend also need allow play charact fulli friend world onlin multiplay game realli love game feel need clarifi way coop game liter show boss wish continu play friend need pile summon materi would reccommend singl player multiplay

"2023 Product received for free As someone who has been playing counter-strike since 2001, I can say this is the worst version yet. Between massive registration errors, terrible graphics that make it feel more for kids, awful lighting affects, the amount of broken spray and pray laser beams even while people are running, taking away the ability to see damage in console(was extremely helpful in cs:go).

2022 Great! 9/10 will be 10/10 once mortal empires map comes and some bug fixes,great mortal empir map come bug fix
"2022 TLDR: Don't buy. Lots of bugs that CA seem reluctant to fix. Plus pricing is a problem. Original review posted July 2022, see bottom of review:So its been almost a year since I wrote my short review. To answer any questions about performance, it has improved greatly, it's still not the best but it is miles better than it was for me at least.As for pricing I stand with the larger community. CA have tried to push a price hike to make up for their predicted losses whilst their other projects are in the works. That's not the communities issue and should not be expected to cover that predicted loss.IS THE GAME WORTH BUYING?? In short I feel it is not. TWW2 is a better game with far more polish at this time. Buy that and any DLC at a key site/on sale and you'll have a blast.Furthermore there has been very little in terms of bug fixing, including a long list of issues that really break any positives I could raise in this review. The following is a comment from the TW subreddit listing a few of the major issues that Dev leads seem to not be willing to fix a year after they were reported:""For me it feels pointless to even consider purchasing DLC when the base game is in a state like this.Most of these have been reported countless times and are often marked as a ""Known Issue"" for many months.To spread awareness in the playerbase/customerbase of the critical/core long-standing bugs & issues in Tww3, here are the ones I know of:-Campaign map AI utterly sucks, unable to put up a proper fight, build/upgrade up its armies or effectively develop its empires.-Diplomacy mechanics and diplomacy AI in all ways & forms is beyond awful, especially around vassals and alliances-AI is bugged/limited in its perception of nearby faction (AI is literally not aware what factions are nearby [no diplomatic contact]).-Unit pathing in manual battles, especially cities with construct-able barricades, is awful-Units refusing to path through broken city gates & destroyed city walls, instead insisting on using ladders to slowly climb up & exhaust themselves.-Cavalry/monsters getting models stuck, which pulls back the whole unit into death.-Units dropping/forgetting orders, even in the middle of pitched melee combat-Units not shooting because they are ""moving fast"" while being stationary-Units unable to shoot despite having clear Line Of Sight-Battle maps being broken for pathing and LOSight, especially on top of wall crenelations-Auto-resolve insists on damaging & killing Single-entity-monsters and especially artillery pieces, even when the player army outnumbers the enemy 5 to 1.-Auto-resolve still gives cities a ridiculous advantage, even when the player army outnumbers the enemy minor settlement garrison 5 to 1.-Certain units & lords/heroes fail to properly do their charging attack-Units (especially large ones) will randomly die when attacking certain walls/gates or being remotely in proximity of a collapsing wall (but nowhere near close enough for it to be a valid danger).-Units (even lords on foot) will randomly die when climbing ladders.-Some lords (Cathay dragons especially) just flat out fail to perform melee attacks for well over 10 seconds at a time.-AI does not understand nor properly react during the defence of siege battles, it will spread out its army across the map and be unable to fight a concentrated force.-AI charging his fastest units at the start of battle into certain death, especially lords/heroes like Belakor-AI clueless about properly using AOE magic & magic in general, which also makes anything ""anti magic"" rather useless-Hundreds of bugs related to skills, techs, items, unit abilities/stats, building mechanics etc etc.-Sometimes two characters (lords/heroes) will be placed on the exact same coordinates on the campaign map, permanently preventing them from movement and interaction.-Item qualities being nonsense, with common ones often being better than rare/special ones.-Lord/Hero traits either not working or straight up inferior compared to other available ones.-WOChaos revive Norsca faction mechanic intentionally broken by CA because they could not be bothered to properly fix it.-Manual battle AI will sometimes simply not activate, instead its units refuse to attack/defend/move. Seen most often in ambush battles and wood elf forest defensive battles.-Countless quests for lord items or unlocking special lords/heroes do not work properly-AI occasionally able to see your ambush/hidden armies from across immense distances & react to their positioning.-Skirmish mode on ranged units often failing to trigger/react, causing the ranged unit to just stand still-AI will often prioritize targeting, sabotaging or annoying the player even if it means certain doom for its faction.-Player units are utterly unable to finish off a broken leadership/fleeing unit, especially if it is a single entity like a foot lord.-Squads of large-sized ranged units (like salamander/razordon hunting packs) after finishing a move order will take forever to ""wiggle around"" before actually firing-Confederated lords for factions that have loyalty mechanics (skaven etc) will often start at zero loyalty.-Confederated lords will sometimes not be able to change their mounts.-Confederated Legendary lords will sometimes lack their immortality trait, meaning their next death is permanent.-Completely non-functional mechanic for automatic development of cities (everyone forgot this even exists in game because it never worked)-AI lacking any proper skill builds for most lords and heroes, which both makes them weaker and makes those lords useless for confederation.-Bugs related to construct-able objects on defensive maps, where units get stuck in barricades or cannot attack them-Fresh bugs like Bretonia damsels, wood elf ariel, Nakai unit recruitment etc etc.-Black Ark unique map army spawn positions AGAIN bugged, after it was fixed in late TWWH 2-Black Ark capability to offer recruitment to nearby Dark Elf armies bugs out when the Black Ark is garrisoned in a city.-AI will readily kill its own armies by trying to occupy ruins that have just been destroyed by extremely unfriendly (but not yet at war) factions which are still surrounding that location (from the previous turns razing).-AI will readily abandon its capital city and flee to some meaningless tier 1 settlement when facing an equal force (instead of fighting where its chance is best, inside the capitol).-Some sea objects (like islands/treasure/skull/carcass) will cause a guaranteed crash to desktop-AI will insist on besieging a weak settlement for 10 turns despite outnumbering & overpowering the garrison 5 to 1, and auto-resolve showing certain defeat for the players city.-Various lord/hero equip-able ancillaries that fail to work properly-Vampire Count/Coast UI for showing raise dead pool possibilities (near city bar UI) does not show units recruit-able from battle casualties.-Certain unique Cathay Caravan rewards are again inaccessible, despite being ""fixed"" in some previous patch (such as the vampire weapon).-There is a limited number of names for generic lords/heroes, and once they have all been used up the game notifications will start showing nonsense (mixing up factions, names & icons etc).""20 mins played with very poor performance. It's difficult to understand why they made changes to the engine when WH2 looked great. 3080ti and 7900k for reference. It's a shame because the game is unplayable on the campaign map with less than 10fps unless I am zoomed right in. FYI I did not pay full price for the game. Edit will likely follow if I get this working well enough.

I don't think I've ever experienced something quite like it. Torturous frustration banging my head against a boss for an hour or so, and then the burst of shear joy when you beat the obstacle. I've had a few framedrops from time to time, but the pure frustration of failure after failure against a boss sort of glazes over those few between technical frustrations. I'm loving it.

"If you are trying to measure this as strictly a standalone video game, and aren't buying this for the IP, it delivers on an 7-8 out of 10 experience fairly well. Nothing too crazy, no standout feature, no unique mechanics. It's a really polished and good looking 3rd person shooter which reminds you of what the bar once was for that genre. Think a 2010s game with 2024 graphics. Move from one area to the next shooting all enemies, rinse repeat. There is no progression of any kind barring the story. There is also no mid-game ability unlocks unlike games. What you see is what you get from mission 1 to the end minus some set piece levels with a flamethrower and a jetpack.For 40k fans though, which I am, this delivers on every promise as a space marine simulator. You now get to BE the little model you spent hours painting (with even the option to customize using actual games workshop paints in multiplayer), and allow yourself to be immersed in the frontline of those epic battles you imagine when you play tabletop. The voice acting is everything you expected. From over the top macho yelling, to fervent screams, and all in the name of the holy emperor.Folks may complain about the simplicity of the game, which is why I started with that point. Still, if you know your 40k lore, and know what to expect of space marines as a whole without dumb expectations (such as characterization from beings who only exist for war), this is all you you would ever need in a space marine game. It doesn't exceed expectations, but it does deliver on its promises.",tri measur strictli standalon video game arent buy ip deliv experi fairli well noth crazi standout featur uniqu mechan realli polish good look person shooter remind bar genr think game graphic move one area next shoot enemi rins repeat progress kind bar stori also midgam abil unlock unlik game see get mission end minu set piec level flamethrow jetpackfor fan though deliv everi promis space marin simul get littl model spent hour paint even option custom use actual game workshop paint multiplay allow immers frontlin epic battl imagin play tabletop voic act everyth expect top macho yell fervent scream name holi emperorfolk may complain simplic game start point still know lore know expect space marin whole without dumb expect character be exist war would ever need space marin game doesnt exceed expect deliv promis

"2022 This used to be a review about how much of a mess this launch was.Let me clarify: It is still a mess. Half the factions you paid for have bugs so severe they can ruin playthroughs.When Chaos Dwarves came out I stopped playing as there was a fatal crash that came with the tooltip ""update"". This took I believe over a month to fix.The game gets no updates, some say only one dude is in charge of updates all-together and honestly, I'm at a point where I'm willing to believe it.They are pooling their money into other projects, all the while draining their succesful franchises for corporate profits. They use their employees as meat shields, saying ""costs are up!"".They've made record PROFITS. I'd be surprised if 1% of the money made from price gouging will go to employees and not the CEO who seems to be an ardent defender of this ""change"". I wonder if this could have to do with the fact CEO's make around 400 more money on average than normal workers, most of which comes from boni gained by... price gouging such as this. None of this will go to the working people, all of it will end in the pockets of people who openly despise you.Let me also here just address the elephant in the room.150% price increase. Yes, you did not misread. This is real. This is reality, as absurd as the idea of a 150% price increase sounds.Nothing more really needs to be said. They killed three kingdoms for cash. Now they're killing this. Is this CA's fault? Is it SEGA's fault? Does it matter?Do not support it. This game, the people behind it, do not respect you.And don't be a fool, you can buy a good game like baldur's gate instead.And that's my recommendation, leave this accursed land of warhammer 3 and never return.",use review much mess launch waslet clarifi still mess half faction paid bug sever ruin playthroughswhen chao dwarv came stop play fatal crash came tooltip updat took believ month fixth game get updat say one dude charg updat alltogeth honestli im point im will believ itthey pool money project drain succes franchis corpor profit use employe meat shield say cost uptheyv made record profit id surpris money made price goug go employe ceo seem ardent defend chang wonder could fact ceo make around money averag normal worker come boni gain price goug none go work peopl end pocket peopl openli despis youlet also address eleph price increas ye misread real realiti absurd idea price increas soundsnoth realli need said kill three kingdom cash theyr kill ca fault sega fault matterdo support game peopl behind respect youand dont fool buy good game like baldur gate insteadand that recommend leav accurs land warhamm never return

It does not hold your hand at all. It is brutal. I have struggled with Souls-like games because of this. However, Elden Ring may be the first one that I will finish. Simply because the open world design really improves the formula. If you're frustrated or stuck on a boss, go somewhere else. There is a ton to explore. Co op is great fun once you get used to how it works. Unfortunately, the servers aren't very stable and it can sometimes be laggy or disconnect.Even with these rough edges, the game is going to go down in history as one of the greatest RPGs. I just hope they'll give it the polish it deserves. The combat and variety of weapons and items is astounding. The world is massive and beautiful.

"Dear CS2 devs,You know what? I’ve finally figured it out. Those ‘cheaters’ we keep complaining about? They’re not cheaters; they’re just misunderstood game testers.Think about it:1. Wallhackers: They’re not seeing through walls; they’re just helping the map designers by pointing out weak spots in the architecture.2. Aimbot Users: They’re not auto-aiming; they’re simply showcasing the game’s advanced AI.3. Speed Hackers: They’re not breaking the sound barrier; they’re just auditioning for the next ‘Fast & Furious’ movie.4. ESP Users: They’re not psychic; they’re just predicting the future.5. Spinbotters: They’re not spinning like Beyblades; they’re just practicing their ballet moves.So, next time you encounter a ‘cheater,’ give them a virtual high-five.

"Solid 8/10 with a side of issuesI played through all of campaign on hard and a bit of multiplayer, long story short: campaign is great, multi could be better. I'm gonna go over what problems I noticed so it may sound a bit negative, but overall I'm having a blast with the game, so if you want some Warhammer power fantasy, this is the gameCampaignI'll try to make this as technical as possible and [REDACT] any spoilersI liked the story, I loved the visuals and cherished the weapons. Not gonna talk much about story overall, characters are servicable, they are Astartes, so you don't expect highly emotional and expressive performance, they do a good job conveying their arcs, and the plot kept me engaged.Visuals are amazing. The arenas and setpieces as well as cutscenes are absoultely gorgeous, however there is a huge whiplash when pre-rendered cutscene cuts to in-game one, and there is one bizzare scene, where the squad lands on planet after orbital drop, during which they obviously they all have their helmets on. When they land there is a small dust cloud, and when it sets after half a second, they have all lost their hekmets, regardless of settings Again, don't wanna get too much into individual examples, cause story, I'll only say they peak in Act III for me, but that may be because I love Thousand Sons.About music... to be honest I didn't hear it most of the time (mixing is a bit weird), so not much to say here.In terms of guns all of them are distinct, the sound and feedback is great (tho there are minor issues, like altfire for underbarrel grenade launcher clipping sideways from hand), and the melee weapons and executions let you unleash absolute, glorious and cinematic carnage only made better with executions.That said, there are also issues. For campaign melee is the way to go, and for a good reason. But there are some tanky ranged enemies, which can be a pain to deal with. You see, most weapons seem to be designed for close- to mid-range combat (in multiplayer I saw a tooltip about most weapons damage decreasing with distance, don't know if it works in campaign too), so you have to either get closer to aforementioned enemies (if you can, they sometimes are on inaccessible ledges/platforms, or they just shoot you on approach), or shoot half your ammo into them, which might be problematic, because most of the time you are engaged in melee. You can use some long range guns, but then they are not very good at dealing with any other enemies. In my opinion adding a bit of stagger to shots and making you able to aim while running with side weapon would solve this a bit, and also make the small gun serve a purpose beside finishers.The second problem: these flying f***s. You'll know which ones. This is mostly extention of previous thing, except you can't get to melee range with them at all. They have powerful range attacks and they buff the hordes. So on one hand game tells you to focus them as sort of sergeants, but you can only do this with ranged weapons (and trust me, those guys soak up your ammo) while dodging their attacks AND managing chaff. Tbh they are manageable on their own, but when there's 2 or more, you don't even have that much time to shoot at them, because you have to dodge them (some cooldown shared between all of them would be nice, but then It'd look like they are getting in queue to attack, I don't know). I'm focusing on them so much, because fighting them is one of the very few moments, that feel tedious during the game.Also, play campaign on the controller if you can, it really isn't made for mouse and keyboard.MultiplayerI'll be a bit more critical here, but that may be, because from the beginning I wanted to play the Assault class, which I think suffers from some key problems in the mode.Remember earlier when I said melee is the way to go in campaign? Well here it's the complete opposite, I have to remind myself constantly to not use melee. During melee you are almost completely still, and time before swings is long enough enemies will just run away and shoot you, and it doesn't do that much damage, (which is weird IMO, in gameplay perspective powerful melee is the incentive to get close and take risks, here it just isn't worth it, on assault after slamming next to an enemy it is better to shoot them with a bolt pistol than use melee. And that is if they don't shoot you down on approach) This may be better with Bulwark, but I haven't played it, and they have a shield, so they at least won't be shot on approach.""So ok, slamming down on enemies doesn't work, so I'll just try shooting them while hovering."" Yeah, about that. Remember when I told you about tooltip saying damage falls with distance? Assault has a sidearm only, so you have to be close to hit your shots and deal meaningful damage. But you don't wanna be close, 'cause then other class with proper range option will just outdamage you (Emperor forbid you get too close to heavy). Long range rifles don't suffer from that, as their damage doesn't fall off, and they love a hovering immobile target on open space. This is a bit of a rant, but I feel like every other class has a way to deal with the disadvantage, I myself had some success with Assault, but mostly when enemy team either didn't look up or I could ambush some solo players, but if they correct for that, it's over. I just love jump packs and desperately want them to have a place, I'm biased here and I don't care. I think melee damage should be upped and some movement during melee added, in this state I think it is just underwhelming, and dueling a World Eater in PvP would be awesome.Also, left side cover is OP, your crosshair being on right side of your model makes peaking from right side of cover very good, and peaking from left side very bad, as enemies see you before you can see them. EA Battlefront solved it by allowing you to switch the side crosshair is on, but I don't know if it is possible here, so I'll just say it's something you have to keep in mind.However, let me reiterateThe game is awesome. The multi is fun. Contents of this review are critical in due to tendency to focus on the bad, me being salty about state of jump pack b0i and avoiding spoiling the game. I had a real blast playing through it and I'll be playing co-op with a friend soon, looking forward to playing this and any future content, great job devs.",solid side issuesi play campaign hard bit multiplay long stori short campaign great multi could better im gon na go problem notic may sound bit neg overal im blast game want warhamm power fantasi gamecampaignil tri make technic possibl redact spoilersi like stori love visual cherish weapon gon na talk much stori overal charact servic astart dont expect highli emot express perform good job convey arc plot kept engagedvisu amaz arena setpiec well cutscen absoult gorgeou howev huge whiplash prerend cutscen cut ingam one one bizzar scene squad land planet orbit drop obvious helmet land small dust cloud set half second lost hekmet regardless set dont wan na get much individu exampl caus stori ill say peak act iii may love thousand sonsabout music honest didnt hear time mix bit weird much say herein term gun distinct sound feedback great tho minor issu like altfir underbarrel grenad launcher clip sideway hand mele weapon execut let unleash absolut gloriou cinemat carnag made better executionsthat said also issu campaign mele way go good reason tanki rang enemi pain deal see weapon seem design close midrang combat multiplay saw tooltip weapon damag decreas distanc dont know work campaign either get closer aforement enemi sometim inaccess ledgesplatform shoot approach shoot half ammo might problemat time engag mele use long rang gun good deal enemi opinion ad bit stagger shot make abl aim run side weapon would solv bit also make small gun serv purpos besid finishersth second problem fli fs youll know one mostli extent previou thing except cant get mele rang power rang attack buff hord one hand game tell focu sort sergeant rang weapon trust guy soak ammo dodg attack manag chaff tbh manag there dont even much time shoot dodg cooldown share would nice itd look like get queue attack dont know im focus much fight one moment feel tediou gamealso play campaign control realli isnt made mous keyboardmultiplayeril bit critic may begin want play assault class think suffer key problem moderememb earlier said mele way go campaign well complet opposit remind constantli use mele mele almost complet still time swing long enough enemi run away shoot doesnt much damag weird imo gameplay perspect power mele incent get close take risk isnt worth assault slam next enemi better shoot bolt pistol use mele dont shoot approach may better bulwark havent play shield least wont shot approachso ok slam enemi doesnt work ill tri shoot hover yeah rememb told tooltip say damag fall distanc assault sidearm close hit shot deal meaning damag dont wan na close caus class proper rang option outdamag emperor forbid get close heavi long rang rifl dont suffer damag doesnt fall love hover immobil target open space bit rant feel like everi class way deal disadvantag success assault mostli enemi team either didnt look could ambush solo player correct love jump pack desper want place im bias dont care think mele damag up movement mele ad state think underwhelm duel world eater pvp would awesomealso left side cover op crosshair right side model make peak right side cover good peak left side bad enemi see see ea battlefront solv allow switch side crosshair dont know possibl ill say someth keep mindhowev let reiterateth game awesom multi fun content review critic due tendenc focu bad salti state jump pack avoid spoil game real blast play ill play coop friend soon look forward play futur content great job dev

"2022 I'm sorry for leaving a negative review, but I feel like this game is going to be the first step in a long, downward-spiralling road for FromSoft. People are playing this up as a masterpiece of FromSoft's when the issues are even more glaring than when people were screeching about DS2's ""faults"". I don't want this to become the Gold Standard for FromSoft (Pun Intended). My complaints have nothing to do with the open-world, and though I wish there were less carbon-copy bosses, I think it was fine to reuse them a little every now and then to fill out the sheer size of the place. Constant boss duos was miserable though, please stop doing that. godskin duo, magma wyrm and the falling star beast particularly were just awful bosses that i loathe to even remember. Nigh-undodgeable shockwaves that every large enemy constantly spams also really doesn't help. Long combos punctuated by the boss delaying for 13 college semesters, allowing you to write a dissertation and graduate summa ♥♥♥ laude with a doctorate's in patience before he decides to hit you for all your HP 3 times over in the span of a millisecond with FromSoft's patented ""funny tracking TM"" also leaves a bad taste in my mouth.The health and damage scaling in this game is unlivable. Everyone is doing the same 4 cookie-cutter meta builds just to survive the game, let alone do PvP. There is *no* room for build variety in this game, even with so many gosh-darn weapons and armor options. I had to ditch the mace partway through for the sword of night and flame because ordinary, mundane weapons just don't survive into the late game, except for maybe the same greatswords that have been equally-busted ever since DS1. Even with all the weapon upgrades, ordinary one-handers just fall off in damage and the way bosses execute combos with blinding speed or with stupidly-long delays, making windows to attack TINY, it's just not worth having a faster-swinging one-hander instead of a hard-hitting two-hander. I am sick of being buried as a sword-and-board build in every game.On top of that, dying in one hit to one attack in a boss' combo if you aren't actively dumping a third of your total levels in an NG into vigor is unacceptable. If there is a previous game that had this issue, then correct me, but I have never seen it be so bad in a FromSoft game before, especially with how this game packages bosses in a way that they fight like bosses from Sekiro while giving you Dark Souls III movement and controls. It is a recipe for disaster. I have never before now had the issue in a FromSoft game where when I kill a boss, I think ""Thank God that's over"" instead of ""That was a cool fight with neat atmosphere."" of course there a few black sheep bosses in every FromSoft game, but I have felt that consistently with every boss after Godrick (I personally liked his fight). It is a chore to fight bosses, especially when their health gets insurmountably high and one single mistake in a fight with them means instant death.People saying to upgrade summons kinda proves my point because the game is so unreasonable in terms of boss health and damage, unforgiving combos, punishing you for punishing enemies and etc. that you are forced to play a very specific way if you want to reasonably win. I don't like games that have only one way to be played, ESPECIALLY when one of their biggest consistent selling points is offering you a wide range of customization options. Also for God's sake please add a left-handed option, DS2 allowed me to beat the game left-handed and it drives me insane that a game touts customization but then refuses to have an option for people who make up 15% of the freaking population. That's gotta be enough to warrant a left-hand option if devs caved to the pressure of the 2 whole people banshee-wailing about replacing gender with body type.I've got a lot of time in all of the fromsoft games, DS 1-3, Sekiro, I've even cleared all the King's Field games except for the first one with a buddy. I wanted to love this game, it looked like a great co-op adventure, and I was willing to overlook the design decisions inspired by George R R Martin (The kinds of stories he writes just don't fit with FromSoft's history of design, in my opinion, George writes too much about sex and political intrigue, and the lore with Mohgwyn and the lover's spat between Radagon and whats-her-face just didn't feel like it belonged, in my opinion) but this game just really made me sad. I was repping this game all the way up to release.All in all, Bok the seamster was my one refuge in this game. I truly loved his character, he was delightful. That's it for my review.",im sorri leav neg review feel like game go first step long downwardspiral road fromsoft peopl play masterpiec fromsoft issu even glare peopl screech fault dont want becom gold standard fromsoft pun intend complaint noth openworld though wish less carboncopi boss think fine reus littl everi fill sheer size place constant boss duo miser though pleas stop godskin duo magma wyrm fall star beast particularli aw boss loath even rememb nighundodg shockwav everi larg enemi constantli spam also realli doesnt help long combo punctuat boss delay colleg semest allow write dissert graduat summa laud doctor patienc decid hit hp time span millisecond fromsoft patent funni track tm also leav bad tast mouthth health damag scale game unliv everyon cookiecutt meta build surviv game let alon pvp room build varieti game even mani goshdarn weapon armor option ditch mace partway sword night flame ordinari mundan weapon dont surviv late game except mayb greatsword equallybust ever sinc even weapon upgrad ordinari onehand fall damag way boss execut combo blind speed stupidlylong delay make window attack tini worth fasterswing onehand instead hardhit twohand sick buri swordandboard build everi gameon top die one hit one attack boss combo arent activ dump third total level ng vigor unaccept previou game issu correct never seen bad fromsoft game especi game packag boss way fight like boss sekiro give dark soul iii movement control recip disast never issu fromsoft game kill boss think thank god that instead cool fight neat atmospher cours black sheep boss everi fromsoft game felt consist everi boss godrick person like fight chore fight boss especi health get insurmount high one singl mistak fight mean instant deathpeopl say upgrad summon kinda prove point game unreason term boss health damag unforgiv combo punish punish enemi etc forc play specif way want reason win dont like game one way play especi one biggest consist sell point offer wide rang custom option also god sake pleas add lefthand option allow beat game lefthand drive insan game tout custom refus option peopl make freak popul that got ta enough warrant lefthand option dev cave pressur whole peopl bansheewail replac gender bodi typeiv got lot time fromsoft game ds sekiro ive even clear king field game except first one buddi want love game look like great coop adventur will overlook design decis inspir georg r r martin kind stori write dont fit fromsoft histori design opinion georg write much sex polit intrigu lore mohgwyn lover spat radagon whatsherfac didnt feel like belong opinion game realli made sad rep game way releaseal bok seamster one refug game truli love charact delight that review

"Product received for free I recently had the pleasure of playing Black Myth Wukong, and I must say that it is truly a masterpiece. The game is a return to form for the action-adventure genre, with its fast-paced combat, intricate puzzles, and beautiful open world. I am grateful to the developers, Game Science, for bringing us such a high-quality game.One of the things that sets Black Myth Wukong apart from other games is its commitment to its vision. The game does not bend to the ""woke agenda"" as many other recent titles have in past years. Instead, it stays true to its roots and delivers an experience that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The performance of Black Myth Wukong is also top-notch. Even on an older system, the game runs smoothly and looks stunning. I was able to run the game on max settings with no issues, which is a testament to the optimization work done by the developers.I will easily put 1000+ hours into this game. The world of Black Myth Wukong is so rich and detailed that I find myself lost in it for several hours at a time. The combat is also incredibly satisfying, with a wide range of weapons and abilities to choose from.In conclusion, Black Myth Wukong is a must-play for any fan of action-adventure games. It is a return to form for the genre, and a shining example of what games can be when developers are allowed to focus on creating a great experience, rather than pandering to a political agenda. I highly recommend checking it out on Steam.444",product receiv free recent pleasur play black myth wukong must say truli masterpiec game return form actionadventur genr fastpac combat intric puzzl beauti open world grate develop game scienc bring us highqual gameon thing set black myth wukong apart game commit vision game bend woke agenda mani recent titl past year instead stay true root deliv experi entertain thoughtprovok perform black myth wukong also topnotch even older system game run smoothli look stun abl run game max set issu testament optim work done developersi easili put hour game world black myth wukong rich detail find lost sever hour time combat also incred satisfi wide rang weapon abil choos fromin conclus black myth wukong mustplay fan actionadventur game return form genr shine exampl game develop allow focu creat great experi rather pander polit agenda highli recommend check

"Much more than what i expected to be, this game really came in as a suprise.Combat is really smooth and theres so many abilities and tricks you can do even 3-4 hours into the game.No need to talk about graphics other than above expected performance, absolutely stunning.Boss fights are really good, some do dodges / feints which is a welcome experience. Not gonna say as hard as sekiro or souls games but i definitely see the potential because i've fought like 5 bosses in 3 hours and im still in the first area i think, stuck at one of them lol.Lastly my favorite thing, cinematic inclusions to bossfights, really increases the production value in my eyes x)Kind of feels like a god of war and sekiro had a child in a good way, buy it \o/",much expect game realli came suprisecombat realli smooth there mani abil trick even hour gameno need talk graphic expect perform absolut stunningboss fight realli good dodg feint welcom experi gon na say hard sekiro soul game definit see potenti ive fought like boss hour im still first area think stuck one lollastli favorit thing cinemat inclus bossfight realli increas product valu eye xkind feel like god war sekiro child good way buy

"2023 I enjoyed playing the game but the game is extremely poorly optimized. I have a RTX 3070 Ti and Ryzen 5800X and it's pushing both to extreme measures for no reason. I tried capping the game with Nvidia software, I tried different settings which only reduce my temps. But the CPU usage and GPU for this game is nuts. Please optimized it better and I'll give it a thumbs up! Another thing which I didn't like was how much the DLC was worth and how much DLC their was to purchase for already 60 dollar title...Edit: Months have passed after this review and yes, performance uptake on my hardware has majorly decrease! Thanks for that, Now I returned back to the game after months of not playing because my hardware wanted to commit PC sapuuko on this game. Either ways, I come back and it turns out the community is ass blasting this game into oblivion for a lot of reasons including not listening to their fan base and releasing two DLC that cost 25 dollars a pop which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ insane in my opinion...

"Basically, Once Human is like a mash up of State of Decay, Fallout 76, and The Division, with some Secret World influence.The game has its issues and a bit janky, but it's just so much fun filled with a lot of content. You've got main quests to follow, side quests that you can find in settlements and the open world, as well as side activities and public events. Main quests are fully voice acted, but side quests are mostly not. Combat is a bit too easy so far, but I haven't progressed that much compared to others. Enemy varieties are at least very robust, you'll always find new enemies as you progress through the map and story. Progression is very natural, and the game doesn't give you new gear at every opportunity, so each upgrade feels substantial. Besides combat, you also progress in the survival aspect to unlock more recipes and building materials. The game is very very generous for f2p lots of stuff that could've been paywalled are totally free in this. Most of the stuff from gears to building materials are free and unlockable via your skilltree. Inventory limit is very generous, and you can build as many storages as you wanted to. You can change appearance for free with a mirror, you can buy your item of choice directly instead of RNG with gacha, there's no premium perk or anything affecting gameplay, etc. Most of the negative reviews came from character creation limitations at launch. Like people couldn't delete theirs and move to another server, leave negative review, and left. The devs fixed it quite swiftly, but the damage is already done. There are also a lot of confusions about the seasons, even though not everything will be wiped. The devs posted a FAQ on it to explained it better, since lots of stuff can be carried over to the new season including gears, mats, cosmetic, and many others. Reviews are moving to positive side nowadays.",basic human like mash state decay fallout divis secret world influenceth game issu bit janki much fun fill lot content youv got main quest follow side quest find settlement open world well side activ public event main quest fulli voic act side quest mostli combat bit easi far havent progress much compar other enemi varieti least robust youll alway find new enemi progress map stori progress natur game doesnt give new gear everi opportun upgrad feel substanti besid combat also progress surviv aspect unlock recip build materi game gener lot stuff couldv paywal total free stuff gear build materi free unlock via skilltre inventori limit gener build mani storag want chang appear free mirror buy item choic directli instead rng gacha there premium perk anyth affect gameplay etc neg review came charact creation limit launch like peopl couldnt delet move anoth server leav neg review left dev fix quit swiftli damag alreadi done also lot confus season even though everyth wipe dev post faq explain better sinc lot stuff carri new season includ gear mat cosmet mani other review move posit side nowaday

STILL does not launch properly and freezes at launch OR otherwise the gameplay freezes every 10 seconds. I got this game on cdkeys so I can't even get a refund either. Simply amazing.I also submitted a ticket on the Focus website and they responded to my ticket saying that they are investigating these issues still but no fix at this time and they did not provide any ETA.I'm no longer wasting my time trying to find a fix. I have almost 2000 games on steam and this is the only one that is having this issue. It's not an issue with my system. This game is very clearly the issue and I highly suggest anyone else experiencing similar issues to report this game as broken on steam.Original review:Game won't even launch. I have a nvidia 3090 gpu, AMD 5950x cpu, 128gb ddr4 ram, m.2 ssd for boot and the game is installed on a separate m.2. When I launch the game it pops up with the anticheat screen loading. After that it goes full screen just black and says not responding. No amount of troubleshooting I seem to do fixes it. I can't even get to the main menu.Figured out to get it to launch literally just click launch from steam and WAIT and eventually it will load. DO NOT CLICK ANYTHING ELSE UNTIL IT LOADS.The default setting when the game starts is set to UNLIMITED FRAME RATE. Like good lord my computer was pushing 240fps in 1440p my computer was just an absolute space heater until I locked the framerate to 60.Even after turning unlimited framerate off I realized simply the act of LAUNCHING THE GAME pushes my GPU and CPU so incredibly hard that both temperatures will reach around 90 celsius almost instantly.When I am able to start the actual campaign the gameplay freezes literally almost 10 seconds. It is like a 50% chance of it crashing whenever it freezes otherwise it just freezes every 10 seconds.Also sometimes the mission gameplay will get sent into a loading screen saying ""disconnected"" and ""changing host"" and will just send you back to the beginning of the mission. Absolutely ridiculous.Turned everything to lowest settings, vsync off.

"2023 Elden Ring is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling. From the get-go, Elden Ring doesn't impose any particular playstyle or route on you. You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game. Where in previous titles you followed a general path to success, Elden Ring allows you multiple avenues and tools to navigate. The game hides many secrets, shortcuts, optional quests that develop the story, simultaneously make you rethink of a path you'll take. The game drew not just from the landscape of Soulsborne titles but also from the successful gameplay. The combat is challenging. No surprise there since it's FromSoftware game. The diversity of weapons and unique variety of enemies and bosses is astounding. This allowed it to be incredibly diverse in design. It's hard to choose a specific thing that makes the game so enjoyable, from the combat system and transportation to landscape, lore and storytelling. This game deserves nothing but praise from Soulsborne veterans and new players alike.",elden ring masterpiec master art show without tell getgo elden ring doesnt impos particular playstyl rout complet free want start game previou titl follow gener path success elden ring allow multipl avenu tool navig game hide mani secret shortcut option quest develop stori simultan make rethink path youll take game drew landscap soulsborn titl also success gameplay combat challeng surpris sinc fromsoftwar game divers weapon uniqu varieti enemi boss astound allow incred divers design hard choos specif thing make game enjoy combat system transport landscap lore storytel game deserv noth prais soulsborn veteran new player alik

"2022 After patch 1.02.1This patch claims to address some performance issues. First of all, on my rig, the loading times became noticeably slower. Before, travelling to Sites of Lost Grace was almost instant, now it's very much not. I checked with my friend who played before and after - he also noticed the same.Furthermore, now I see stutter in some indoor ares, whereas before I had it mostly in the open-world areas. Outdoor areas are not working any better for me, too. Basically, I have worse experience than before the patch.Original reviewOK, the core of the game is brilliant. Sadly, I can't recommend it now (as of patch 1.02). I disregarded all the technical reviews where a lot of people complained about performance. Most of them didn't run the game on the highest end hardware, so I thought - hey, my specs are better, certainly my hardware will manage. No. This is definitely not subjective, not specific to only my software/hardware, as you can see all over the Internet - people with 20 series and 30 series are having the same problems as I am.I have STRIX RTX 3090 OC, i5-12600K, 32 gigs of DDR5 and WD Black SN850. I also have the latest video card drivers (the ones that explicitly mention Elden Ring support), the latest Windows 10 updates. The game manages to drop frames as low as 40 on pretty much any settings. I also have VRR monitor and it helps but not much - I can perceive frame drops without any FPS counters as it reflects on the gameplay. It's especially noticeable in the open-world areas and affects not only the visual fluidity but also the flow of the battle for me. Basically, not only the frame-rate drops make it harder to time a dodging roll just because the game suddenly stutters right during a boss attack, it also directly translate to input lag where pressing a button does not immediately result in a corresponding action. This game requires precision and the stutter cripples that. In ""dungeons"" (literal dungeons or areas behind the fog) it runs pretty well. For instance, I had no problems during the Margit fight and enjoyed it a lot. But fighting Tree Sentinel was so choppy, I just had to quit the game for good. Edit after playing more. Godrick the Grafted - which is not open-world and is not optional - fight was pretty awful performance-wise. Most of the time it was smooth but at random times, when I was very close to the boss and he would do some attack, the game would stutter. Only because of that it took me almost twice as long to defeat him.Now, on the same hardware I can run Dying Light 2 with all the ray-tracing effects on at 4K (with DLSS) with locked 60 FPS (well, it drops very, very rarely and I can see it only from the counter, it doesn't affect the actual gameplay). If I disable RT in that game, it runs so well, my PC is dead-silent (doesn't stress anything enough to engage fans to make them audible enough). This is mind-blowing. I mean, Elden Ring looks great but it doesn't have any of the interesting technical effects (I wouldn't call this game next-gen in any sense). It doesn't have photorealistic textures of Horizon Forbidden West, it doesn't have incredible shadows and illumination of Dying Light 2.Sadly, I can't refund this anymore: more than 2 hours played. Most of that time I spent trying out different video configurations and going to different areas of the game. Finally, I went on and bought the game on Xbox Series X. In performance mode it looks good (never scales up to 2160p in open-world, so it's not as clear on 4K display as the PC version) and runs perceptibly better (it does have FPS fluctuation but it doesn't effect the gameplay as much as it does on PC). Furthermore, XSX runs the game dead silent, while my PC is very audible in open-world areas, as the game makes the GPU card clock speed go to the maximum (frequencies are higher here when in Dying Light 2 with all the RT).Please, don't support this sort of attitude from the developer with your money, I regret that I did. This is the only new game that runs worse on my PC than on the current generation of consoles. It's beyond ridiculous. If you have the chance, go for the console version, if you don't, just wait for some patches.Some additional information for more clarity.GeForce driver 511.79 (has ""Game Ready for Elden Ring"" in the release notes)Things I've tried in the game settings.- Changing pretty much every setting from lowest to max- 2160p resolution- 1440p resolution - pretty much the same issues. I mean, on RTX 3090 - what the bloody hellNow, it's a D2D12 game, so it has direct access to low-level APIs, which means I had little hope in any of the suggestions found online would help, but it didn't take me too long to try, so I did:- The ""High performance"" thing in Graphics Settings of Windows- Unlimited ""Shader Cache Size"" in NVIDIA settings- Disabling ""Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator""None of the above resulted in a smooth experience. Basically, whatever is causing the stutter, would cause the stutter no matter what settings I had. I can run at 1080 with lowest settings and get stutters at exactly the same places as with 2160p and maximum settings. The game is not bottlenecked by any of my hardware, it's something wrong about the way the developers used D3D12, it seems.Out of curiosity, I've underpowered my GPU (from power target 100% to 80%), lowered GPU boost clock from 1860 MHz to 1674 MHz. Listen to this - no effect on the performance whatsoever! I mean, Elden Ring was actually utilizing the GPU to the max and stuttering. Now it works absolutely the same with significantly underpowered GPU.Now, as for comparison to XSX version, as I've played it a bit more now.- Initial loading time (continue from main menu) is twice as slow on Xbox Series X as on my PC! This is a bummer.- Looks like loading time on death are slightly better than the initial loading, but it's still much slower than that of PC.- In open-world the resolution is very noticeably lower than 2160p. Furtermore, the frame-rates are very eager to drop. My current go-to for testing is the very early Tree Sentinel fight. On PC it's jarringly bad. On XSX, in addition to having sub-4K resolution, the frame-rate here goes pretty low but it doesn't feel that bad with VRR. I actually almost killed the boss with the initial-level character on my first attempt on XSX. On PC I struggled to kill him even after gaining levels and downing Margit - only because of the major stutter.In conclusion, please don't give money to this kind of developer. I see already that the game sold very well on PC and it's sad. I mean, who forced the company to release the PC version without properly testing it? I am awfully sure, they were aware of the performance issues when they released it (otherwise they had zero testing, which is even worse). Why not release the console versions first and delay the PC version? Also, I scanned the Steam forums/reviews and there are still plenty of people claiming they have a smooth experience. At this point, I don't believe they do. By now I know some people tend not to pay attention. I've seen plenty of people - before current-gen consoles - claiming they are totally happy with 30 FPS in their games and saying that 60 does not improve the game. Now look - since the PS5 and XSX started having plenty of games supporting higher frame rates, the console crowd is loving it and complainign about new games running at 30 FPS. Now people are saying that anything higher than 60 is unnecessary and not even perceivable (yeah, right). In a couple of generation the consoles will have 120 FPS in plenty of games and people will enjoy that.",patch patch claim address perform issu first rig load time becam notic slower travel site lost grace almost instant much check friend play also notic samefurthermor see stutter indoor are wherea mostli openworld area outdoor area work better basic wors experi patchorigin reviewok core game brilliant sadli cant recommend patch disregard technic review lot peopl complain perform didnt run game highest end hardwar thought hey spec better certainli hardwar manag definit subject specif softwarehardwar see internet peopl seri seri problem ami strix rtx oc gig wd black also latest video card driver one explicitli mention elden ring support latest window updat game manag drop frame low pretti much set also vrr monitor help much perceiv frame drop without fp counter reflect gameplay especi notic openworld area affect visual fluiditi also flow battl basic framer drop make harder time dodg roll game suddenli stutter right boss attack also directli translat input lag press button immedi result correspond action game requir precis stutter crippl dungeon liter dungeon area behind fog run pretti well instanc problem margit fight enjoy lot fight tree sentinel choppi quit game good edit play godrick graft openworld option fight pretti aw performancewis time smooth random time close boss would attack game would stutter took almost twice long defeat himnow hardwar run die light raytrac effect dlss lock fp well drop rare see counter doesnt affect actual gameplay disabl rt game run well pc deadsil doesnt stress anyth enough engag fan make audibl enough mindblow mean elden ring look great doesnt interest technic effect wouldnt call game nextgen sens doesnt photorealist textur horizon forbidden west doesnt incred shadow illumin die light cant refund anymor hour play time spent tri differ video configur go differ area game final went bought game xbox seri x perform mode look good never scale openworld clear display pc version run percept better fp fluctuat doesnt effect gameplay much pc furthermor xsx run game dead silent pc audibl openworld area game make gpu card clock speed go maximum frequenc higher die light rtpleas dont support sort attitud develop money regret new game run wors pc current gener consol beyond ridicul chanc go consol version dont wait patchessom addit inform claritygeforc driver game readi elden ring releas notesth ive tri game set chang pretti much everi set lowest max resolut resolut pretti much issu mean rtx bloodi hellnow game direct access lowlevel api mean littl hope suggest found onlin would help didnt take long tri high perform thing graphic set window unlimit shader cach size nvidia set disabl microsoft devic associ root enumeratornon result smooth experi basic whatev caus stutter would caus stutter matter set run lowest set get stutter exactli place maximum set game bottleneck hardwar someth wrong way develop use seemsout curios ive underpow gpu power target lower gpu boost clock mhz mhz listen effect perform whatsoev mean elden ring actual util gpu max stutter work absolut significantli underpow gpunow comparison xsx version ive play bit initi load time continu main menu twice slow xbox seri x pc bummer look like load time death slightli better initi load still much slower pc openworld resolut notic lower furtermor framer eager drop current goto test earli tree sentinel fight pc jarringli bad xsx addit resolut framer goe pretti low doesnt feel bad vrr actual almost kill boss initiallevel charact first attempt xsx pc struggl kill even gain level down margit major stutterin conclus pleas dont give money kind develop see alreadi game sold well pc sad mean forc compani releas pc version without properli test aw sure awar perform issu releas otherwis zero test even wors releas consol version first delay pc version also scan steam forumsreview still plenti peopl claim smooth experi point dont believ know peopl tend pay attent ive seen plenti peopl currentgen consol claim total happi fp game say improv game look sinc xsx start plenti game support higher frame rate consol crowd love complainign new game run fp peopl say anyth higher unnecessari even perceiv yeah right coupl gener consol fp plenti game peopl enjoy

"2022 I put 1,700 hours into WH2 and I just can't get into 3. There are things that are great, like the improvements to diplomacy. But overall I find actually playing the game outright unpleasant. By far the biggest problem for me personally is the settlement battles, These are a slog, with endlessly respawning towers, narrow streets that the game's pathfinding is clearly not good enough to handle, AI that has no idea how to actually fight the battles, and battles that seem to drag on forever without much excitement. Turning minor settlement battles into siege battles has also had the effect of making field battles fairly rare, and the latter are far more satisfying to fight. This all has the effect of making me dread actually fighting battles in this game, and given my dislike of the campaign and its mechanics, this means there's little I'm actually enjoying while playing.The campaign took everything bad about the vortex campaign in 2 and doubled down on it all. There's very little freedom in how you approach the campaigns and everything is on a timer. The game penalizes you for expanding beyond a few small provinces. The chaos realms are tedious to get through, each with some gimmick that that just serves to slow the whole process down and which the AI can often bypass entirely. The survival battles at the end of each realm are like siege battles but somehow even longer and less fun, though mercifully you can autoresolve to skip them. Finally the army rosters are disappointing, especially for the demon factions who not only share units between them but who also have fewer units in the first place than the other factions. This compounds the problems with the battles by making them all feel very samey after a short while.As it is right now, I can't really recommend it. I've been lucky to avoid most of the bugs and performance issues other people are experiencing. But even when it's all working as it should, what's here just isn't very compelling. It feels very thin, repetitive, unpolished, and at its worst just straight up boring. Wait until immortal empires or a couple DLC packs drop. What's here right now just isn't worth your time or money. Though even then, this game has issues that go beyond not just having enough content, and I have doubts about the foundations of this game and its longterm quality I was not expecting to have.",put hour cant get thing great like improv diplomaci overal find actual play game outright unpleas far biggest problem person settlement battl slog endlessli respawn tower narrow street game pathfind clearli good enough handl ai idea actual fight battl battl seem drag forev without much excit turn minor settlement battl sieg battl also effect make field battl fairli rare latter far satisfi fight effect make dread actual fight battl game given dislik campaign mechan mean there littl im actual enjoy playingth campaign took everyth bad vortex campaign doubl there littl freedom approach campaign everyth timer game penal expand beyond small provinc chao realm tediou get gimmick serv slow whole process ai often bypass entir surviv battl end realm like sieg battl somehow even longer less fun though merci autoresolv skip final armi roster disappoint especi demon faction share unit also fewer unit first place faction compound problem battl make feel samey short whilea right cant realli recommend ive lucki avoid bug perform issu peopl experienc even work what isnt compel feel thin repetit unpolish worst straight bore wait immort empir coupl dlc pack drop what right isnt worth time money though even game issu go beyond enough content doubt foundat game longterm qualiti expect

On a game that I would consider my favorite of all time. a 150% price increase on DLC when they are reporting that profits are exceeding costs in their latest annual report (when they justify the price increase by saying things are getting more expensive)They than make it worse with their PR manager advertising to us and not addressing the concerns. Such as the latest DLC that is being charged 150% more giving LESS content than the cheaper packs. Holding bugfixing behind DLC launches, and threatening to drop support of the game if we don't buy DLC. Normally I'd laugh that off.

"I've never been so impressed by a game before and I've only beaten the first chapter which took me around 3.5 Hours with minimal sight seeing. Production value is otherworldly. Played the entirety of the souls franchise , and Nioh 2 is my favorite game of all time. Here's some of its strong points.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the introduction sequence. If you've never seen gameplay, don't ruin it for yourself. You'll want to experience it firsthand.- The game doesnt focus on an uphill battle to reach bosses and the bosses are where the majority of effort was placed, which is how it should be. If you've played the souls series you might have been beaten into submission and forced to think that going back to the boss should be a miserable experience, but it shouldnt be and this game reflects it.- Bosses have incredibly dynamic and cinematic attack patterns, additionally the game has perfect dodges and rewards you for doing so. Not only with resource generation but also makes the combat that much cooler with the visual effects. Well played boss fights make you feel like a god.- The attacks / gameplay loop feels clunky at first but within the first 30min youll realize that you can gain the ability to continue a light attack chain even if you've dodged. this is important because the last attack of that combo chain is the only free move that can produce stagger. Whole system is extremely fluid, but youll be thinking at first if its just a 1 button game, it's not. It's just trying to ease you into it so don't worry.- Baked in , out of the gates, unlimited respecs with no punishment for build creativity. Sounds crazy how easy of a W this is and how long its taken a studio to deliver.- Game is absolutely stunning. Only other game that i can compare that has that 'wow factor' of visual fidelity is the Demon Souls remake, if you know you know.- I usually skip cinematics because i cba, but for Wukong i've sat through every one grinning. All in all i thought this level of production was dead in games. Very very very happy to see this game finally release and its not a pile of ♥♥♥♥.

"2023 To be honest, CS2's performance is completely below expectations. After such a long polishing process, the outcome is quite disappointing. Ignoring the existing bugs, which I assume will be fixed in future updates, the main issues for me are the strange feel of the weapons and odd feedback on headshots, giving a waxy sensation. The game's visuals, perhaps due to my unfamiliarity, seem tiring, with overly bright brightness. Despite expecting to adapt quickly to lower graphics settings as in CS:GO, it's evident that the experience lacks the satisfying feeling of the GO era. Lastly, it feels like CS2 is leaning towards CF, and while some added features like throwable monitoring aren't necessarily bad, they seem unnecessary, adding an extra layer that might be considered superfluous.

"2023 New review: I think this game is worth it now. I feel Creative Assembly has FINALLY learned their lesson. Give the customers what they want and they will be happy to buy DLC and play the game. Thrones of Decay DLC is excellent. CA has been responsive on the bug fixes. Sieges still need work (units refuse to enter the city through the gate and will go over the wall instead as an example). Older races need some work due to power creep but I am hopeful they will get the attention they deserve. Full disclosure, I play with SFO overhaul.Original review: Lack of bug fixing and awful siege mechanics make this game a slog right now. So much potential, but I would avoid buying.

"2023 Product received for free Total War: Warhammer 3 is an achievement. They've taken three titles and mashed them into one giant game. It's impressive. It's almost unique and it ""should"" be their magnum opus. Unfortunately they've tripped at the last step and the game is unpolished to a degree that I struggled to recommend it. Should you play this game? Yes, but... be prepared for bugs, and AI issues and seeing the same battle maps again and again and again. You will get frustrated and annoyed with how the game treats you and how it can be a struggle to interact with it sometimes.At it's best Warhammer 3 and Immortal Empires is a visual and strategic feast and one of the best strategy games ever made. Unfortunately tarnished by a stubborn resistance to spending time on fixing bugs and introducing new content to make Warhammer 3 the best game it can be.It really feels like CA have washed their hands of Warhammer 3 and are phoning it in.

Black Myth: Wukong hit practically everything out of the park for me. The visuals are stunning and amazing, the world feels alive and vibrant, bosses are difficult and carefully crafted, the story was intriguing and interesting, and the game was challenging and rewarding. Never have I even thought about looking at and reading enemy and boss bios and stories until this game. That is how thoroughly it got me interested. If I can do anything with this review I would like to convince the reader of this review to buy, download, and play this game. It's a masterpiece and a truly amazing experience.

This is not the case with this game, every corner of the map has a 'surprise' for you to get.It rewards you with every curiosity you tried to do, but it also comes with a price.

"2022 Elden Ring is a phenomenal game but it's hard to look over the hurdles I had to overcome in order to fully enjoy this game.Gameplay: The initial 20 hours of this game were tolerable at best. The first area is too dense for it's own good, filled with the most amount of copy and paste catacombs/caves, containing useless loot 90% of the time. I felt as if my thorough exploration wasn't appropriately rewarded. While this problem persisted throughout my 80 hour play through, it became far less egregious as the filler content became far and few between with an increase in more intricate world and level design.The game truly opens up after you conquer the first legacy dungeon. Suddenly, most of the gear actually becomes useful, and it was refreshing to finally swap weapons 20 hours into the game. This gameplay loop of exploring, killing bosses and looting never got tiresome, because the game gives plenty of opportunities for experimentation and trying new things. Despite the abundance of reused enemies, it was still fun to tackle them with a different strategy.Story: Like every other souls game, the devs didn't bother to explicitly tell me what was going on so I responded by not bothering to pay any attention to the story. The cutscenes and voice acting were cool though.Difficulty: Enemies are extremely aggressive and fast, making these some of the most brutal battles in the series. However, the late games bosses are the definition of artificial difficulty.Overall 9/10",elden ring phenomen game hard look hurdl overcom order fulli enjoy gamegameplay initi hour game toler best first area dens good fill amount copi past catacombscav contain useless loot time felt thorough explor wasnt appropri reward problem persist throughout hour play becam far less egregi filler content becam far increas intric world level designth game truli open conquer first legaci dungeon suddenli gear actual becom use refresh final swap weapon hour game gameplay loop explor kill boss loot never got tiresom game give plenti opportun experiment tri new thing despit abund reus enemi still fun tackl differ strategystori like everi soul game dev didnt bother explicitli tell go respond bother pay attent stori cutscen voic act cool thoughdifficulti enemi extrem aggress fast make brutal battl seri howev late game boss definit artifici difficultyoveral

"2022 In alignment with the sentiments echoed by the community, I find it difficult to ignore the evident case of price gouging here. It's disappointing to witness such a scenario where the value proposition of the DLC SOC seems mismatched with its cost. It would be greatly appreciated if the pricing strategy were reconsidered to better reflect the content's worth, or alternatively, if efforts were directed towards enriching the DLC's offering. This could ultimately lead to a more positive and equitable experience for all users involved.",align sentiment echo commun find difficult ignor evid case price goug disappoint wit scenario valu proposit dlc soc seem mismatch cost would greatli appreci price strategi reconsid better reflect content worth altern effort direct toward enrich dlc offer could ultim lead posit equit experi user involv
"2022 It's finally in a spot where I can confidently say; Yea, go for it. There's still some annoying performance bugs lurking around such as random temporary freezes and slow downs and the like, but no more crashes. Thankfully they're not really annoying enough, or frequent enough, to be bothersome or hamper my enjoyment of the game anymore.Old review (everything not striked out is still relevant as of IE release. I also added some points from post IE release):Honestly a phenomenal game through and through. If you enjoyed the previous TWWH games then you're sure to enjoy this one as well, same as me. However there's too many issues right now for me to really recommend it.Patch 1.1.0: The alt-tab crashing issue (""detailed"" below) seems to be fixed but there's still infrequent crashes usually while loading or just after a load finishes. As well as several strange, random, slow downs.One black screen on alt-tab, which forced me to quit through Task Manager, then two crashes on the following alt-tabs. All under the course of my first three hours. Maybe hold off until this stuff is ironed out.EDIT: I've had four more crashes in the following two hours..and one was when I opened TW:Access from the in-game promt. Good times. mini-edit: Also several more crashes in the chaos realms while just interactive with the objective..EDIT: (Tested in the first two weeks of release and again shortly after IE release) Multiplayer is absolutely shafted right now. Chugs every 2 seconds, then freezes for a solid 5-20 seconds, repeat. It's so awful. There's also this lag of about 2 seconds when clicking on anything. It's pointless to do coop right now. It was perfect in TWWH2 with the same people I tried TWWH3 with. (apparently not everyone has this issue so...keep that in mind). mini-edit: So turns out that verifying game files actually mostly fixed this....but introduced new issues by crashing either our games when we would initiate certain battles. mini-edit-2: the issues are back as of IE release <3EDIT: I've kept having issue like the above, as well as other bugs scaling from passable to incredibly annoying and plenty of performance issues after the first 5 hours of my original review.

"2022 As of now, I must admit that I am fairly disappointed with the game which makes me a lil' sad, since I love Total War Games and especially WH2.The hype was real and WH3 was THAT ONE GAME in years which I pre-ordered / bought full price without a second thought. My complaints arn't based on performance stuff, technical issues, etc.My complaints are based on the gameplay which I find in comparison to WH2 tedious and boring. When you start a campaing in WH2 it's like a rapidly growing snowball. Within the first 50 turns you secure a homebase, you can have one army of semi-elite troops and 1 to 2 basic armies and epic army clashes happen all the time. With WH3 everything is different.- you have much less money to play with (at least with Kislev and Chaos factions, havn't tried others yet). You can barely finance one army with your first one province and second province doesn't really change that.- the movement points of lords and heros don't scale well with the huge map, it takes ages to get around. worst experience is with Slaneesh, it takes sooooo long just to cross the lands 'cause regions are so spread out- it takes ages until your armies are replenished, even basic troops need something like 6 turns to geht from 25% to 100%- AI is often running around avoiding combat. even if I debuff there movement speed it happens very often, that I cannot catch them. but I can't ignore them either, cause then they lay siege on my provinces. - Auto Calc is broken atm. especially with sieges of smaller regions. you need to play every little battle cause otherwise you loose way too many tropps (and remember my complaint with replenishment rates). I don't want to fight small fights, which I win 100%, it gets boring. I only want to fight the epic battles.- Realm of Chaos stuff is way to tedious for my taste. I mean it's a great idea and I wish I liked it more. Worst is Tzeentch Realm where your just walking around some kind of labyrinth trying to find the correct portal. booooring. And at the same time your homeland is insecure and you can't do other ♥♥♥♥ because remember, you can only really fund a single army and that army is away in a Chaos Realm.- even if your're a person who likes the Realms of Chaos I bet after the 2nd, third or fifth time, you're done with it as well. There should be a way to de-activate it or whatever. It's like the Maelstrom in WH2, after a while you don't wanna do these kind of scripted stuff anylonger- some of the Chaos factions mechanics don't really work so well, looking at you Slaneesh and Tzeentch. At first they sound super cool, but then you realize they don't really have the impact you expected (example I never saw a Tzeentch provoked revolt being successfull. usually they spawn to close to the settlements. So AI has an easy time crushing them with a lord and just a few troops, cause settlement troops are within reach and help clear the stack before it grows to 20)These are the major issues I am having with the game right now. There are countless other small things that add up to that. What I like is the love for the details regarding map, factions and faction diversity. And to be fair, when WH1 and 2 launched, they were not polished either. So I am confident that CA will be fast in adressing all the technical and gameplay issues within the next few month, allowing me to enjoy the game more then I do now.Thank you for reading",must admit fairli disappoint game make lil sad sinc love total war game especi hype real one game year preorder bought full price without second thought complaint arnt base perform stuff technic issu etcmi complaint base gameplay find comparison tediou bore start campa like rapidli grow snowbal within first turn secur homebas one armi semielit troop basic armi epic armi clash happen time everyth differ much less money play least kislev chao faction havnt tri other yet bare financ one armi first one provinc second provinc doesnt realli chang movement point lord hero dont scale well huge map take age get around worst experi slaneesh take sooooo long cross land caus region spread take age armi replenish even basic troop need someth like turn geht ai often run around avoid combat even debuff movement speed happen often catch cant ignor either caus lay sieg provinc auto calc broken atm especi sieg smaller region need play everi littl battl caus otherwis loos way mani tropp rememb complaint replenish rate dont want fight small fight win get bore want fight epic battl realm chao stuff way tediou tast mean great idea wish like worst tzeentch realm walk around kind labyrinth tri find correct portal boooor time homeland insecur cant rememb realli fund singl armi armi away chao realm even yourr person like realm chao bet third fifth time your done well way deactiv whatev like maelstrom dont wan na kind script stuff anylong chao faction mechan dont realli work well look slaneesh tzeentch first sound super cool realiz dont realli impact expect exampl never saw tzeentch provok revolt successful usual spawn close settlement ai easi time crush lord troop caus settlement troop within reach help clear stack grow major issu game right countless small thing add like love detail regard map faction faction divers fair launch polish either confid ca fast adress technic gameplay issu within next month allow enjoy game nowthank read

Every region got in nothing is cut!That means the mortal empires map is no longer squished and it adds the WH 3 map on top of it without cutting anything. Its the total campaign experience.The performance is better then expected but since WH 3 reworked graphics it still needs more recources then WH 2.The Warriors of Chaos rework is awesome. The faction is finally very fun and very diffrent from other factions though you need the new DLC for the full experience but its worth it.On top of that Belakor got added as a FREE faction as well.The patch brought factions up to WH 3 standarts though there are some balance issues looking at you infinite healing cap Zombies ;)The game has bugs but way less then you expect. I havent had anything major so the BETA tag should not discourage you from enjoying the game.The game has 2 major issues though and thats AI passiveness on higher difficultys and confederations beeing way too hard for both the player and the AI. Its confirmed that they will adress confederations and AI will surely be fixed as well.WH 3 is very fun and while it still needs some work it looks like its going in the right direction.

"2023 I should mention I adore this game, but I can't recommend anyone buy it. The dev has been straight up pretending it's DLC is oil and pricing it accordingly. It's ridiculous to charge 25 dollars for DLC that doesn't even add much. Remember the Ikit Claw DLC from Warhammer 2? That was 9.99. And it rocked. It felt worth it. You got 2 new unique lords and subfactions to play with. Now what? We get 2-3 lords for 25 dollars? How about instead of releasing more predatory-priced DLC, you balance your game? Give a tiny amount of a ♥♥♥♥ about the people who give you money. There is a free mod that balances ♥♥♥♥ better then any update CA makes for this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. It's ridiculous. They've been making essentially the same game since TW:WH1, and they still haven't figured out how to balance certain factions. On top of that, the constant price hikes show they give zero ♥♥♥♥♥ about their players. People who bought BOTH the previous games and this one are pissed off and buying ♥♥♥♥ from key-sellers because of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they're being treated. This review would swap over to a thumbs up really fast if they actually stopped constantly increasing the price of their DLC. I bet a lot of others would too. I'm gonna add to this review how hopelessly broken the balance is.

"After clearing a stage 4.5 hours in I feel like there is a big ""something"" missing from the combat.It's quite disappointing as the rest of the game looks and feels excellent, from the story telling choices and the UI's.But combat being the main aspect of the game I can't really bring myself to play any further than the Electric Frog Boss very early in the second Chapter.I feel like there is no impact when striking my opponents, the peons are very weak and die too quickly to get that satisfying final hit during the combo but it feels like a waste to use a fully charged heavy to quickly dispatch them with that satisfying smack.When fighting a boss I feel like I'm a flea using CQC on an Ox. I'm relying on my cool-downs to rinse and repeat every single time and after a few too many encounters I can feel the repetitive nature scratching away at my brain.I really wanted to like this game as it IS beautiful the illustrations, the effort in the descriptions of the Yaoguai is insane.I don't know if this is me being picky... but the very obvious invisible walls seems a tad lazy for the quality we see in many areas. I feel like this is an example of ""Being a mile wide but an inch deep"" when it comes to their level design. UE5 is beautiful but it isn't a crutch.I know it's not an open world game but I'd like some creativity when it comes to blocking my path.Pros:- Storytelling- Stunning illustrations- Unintrusive UI (for how many mechanics are at play)Cons:- Flat feeling combat- Early repetitive nature",clear stage hour feel like big someth miss combatit quit disappoint rest game look feel excel stori tell choic uisbut combat main aspect game cant realli bring play electr frog boss earli second chapteri feel like impact strike oppon peon weak die quickli get satisfi final hit combo feel like wast use fulli charg heavi quickli dispatch satisfi smackwhen fight boss feel like im flea use cqc ox im reli cooldown rins repeat everi singl time mani encount feel repetit natur scratch away braini realli want like game beauti illustr effort descript yaoguai insanei dont know picki obviou invis wall seem tad lazi qualiti see mani area feel like exampl mile wide inch deep come level design beauti isnt crutchi know open world game id like creativ come block pathpro storytel stun illustr unintrus ui mani mechan playcon flat feel combat earli repetit natur
"I absolutely recommend this game. I am not a big fan of free to play games. I do however like survival games. I have played most of the big ones. This game is probably the most user-friendly one I've ever played. On top of that even being a free-to-play game It is super dense with content and doesn't have ads playing in your face 24/7 and doesn't feel like you have to pay to advance. I have a decent amount of hours in the game and this feels like one of the most for the people games I play since hell divers. On top of that for this game having just came out the level of thought and content in the game is mindful. A lot of the annoying Misess in other games tend to not exist in this one. Things like having to individually loot items off the ground, not being able to easily see leave around, having to rebuild the same base over and over and over again from scratch. The game feels extremely well thought out and seems like it is built by players. They also implement a live service system that somehow doesn't suck. They make it rewarding and fun to come back to the game week after week. They also do it in such a way that you're worried about messing out. You can always come back 2 weeks late and collect all the rewards from the prior week. The level of respect that is shown to the player in this game shows how little other game show. They also respect grind in that they give you bonuses between certain times for those who work a little bit more. They also have enough content that you don't feel like you're ever stuck and having to grind. There is always something to be unlocked explored or to do. I would have been satisfied spending $40 on this game. There's no way I would believe it was free. If you're wondering why this game has a mixed review and gets so much hate this is why. In the TOS it is stated that your ID may have to be linked to the game. If you are in the Western world this is not a problem for you you are exempt. However in countries such as China that is a requirement by law. This TOS is to address that. However a lot of Western readers of the TOS have obviously flagged this as a problem. However they have an acknowledged that they are exempt from the problem. So that is a resulted in this game getting a massive review bomb that it just blatantly does not deserve.",absolut recommend game big fan free play game howev like surviv game play big one game probabl userfriendli one ive ever play top even freetoplay game super dens content doesnt ad play face doesnt feel like pay advanc decent amount hour game feel like one peopl game play sinc hell diver top game came level thought content game mind lot annoy misess game tend exist one thing like individu loot item ground abl easili see leav around rebuild base scratch game feel extrem well thought seem like built player also implement live servic system somehow doesnt suck make reward fun come back game week week also way your worri mess alway come back week late collect reward prior week level respect shown player game show littl game show also respect grind give bonus certain time work littl bit also enough content dont feel like your ever stuck grind alway someth unlock explor would satisfi spend game there way would believ free your wonder game mix review get much hate to state id may link game western world problem exempt howev countri china requir law to address howev lot western reader to obvious flag problem howev acknowledg exempt problem result game get massiv review bomb blatantli deserv

"2022 Most disappointing game since Cyberpunk.Being a big fan of Total War games in general and Total War: Warhammer II in particular, I REALLY expected to love this game. However, this broken betrayal of a product is not worth your time or money in its present state.Indiana Jones and the Race for the Soul FragmentsThe rifts to Chaos realms opening up COULD have been a very interesting addition to the game. However, the way the game works is that you win the game by entering these rifts and collecting soul fragments. This could be an interesting sort of dynamic story challenge if not for the fact that EVERY OTHER FACTION can do the same thing meaning that even when you are playing in single-player, the whole game just turns into race for the soul fragments VERY EARLY in the campaign.I'm not the only one who noticed this. Angry Joe noted that this ""killed"" the campaign in his review (skip to 27:25) YouTube™ Video: Total War: Warhammer III - Angry Review Views: 655,778 💥Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/AngryJoeShow 🔥YT Join ► https://youtube.com/angryjoeshow/join 👕Our New Merch!► https://www.roguesapparel.com AngryJoe gets in touch with his Inner Demon to rule the... and Mandalore Gaming noted that this basically makes winning any other way almost impossible. YouTube™ Video: Total War Warhammer 3 Review Views: 3,466,500 Total War Warhammer 3 has arrived in a month absolutely stacked for games. This review covers anything and everything that came to mind so prepare for trees and menus. What's worse, the rifts can only be entered by your faction leader which means that winning the game is all about creating min-maxed doomstacks and using them to play what is basically a bad MOBA rather than coordinating armies and managing kingdoms as you would in say, an actual TOTAL WAR game. Broken StoryThis game has one of those awful stories that was clearly put together by people who worked separately and hated each other. For instance, the story clearly states that only a certain person can enter the realms of chaos to do the thing needed to win the game but literally EVERY AI faction actually does that the first chance they get. Characterization is also off. For instance, Kostaltyn is a well-played, sympathetic character in cutscenes but he's an ugly, deranged blowhard on the campaign map. Terrible performance and DenuvoKeep tolerating bugs and so will the devs, This is the most unreliable Total War game I have played so far with all of the issues you might expect including broken AI that can't move properly, constant de-synchs in multiplayer, and of course, crashes that frequently cause you to lose your progress after a tough battle...It's impossible to tell how many of these problems are linked to the use of Denuvo but it certainly isn't helping.ConclusionThis is the first Total War game for which I have posted a negative review and I have been playing the series since the early 2000s.

"2023 What is the current status of TWW III 3.0? Quite simple to describe. Shiny on the outside and rotten to the core. But you have to take a closer look to see it. Which, apparently, not many are capable of.To be honest, I have no problem with the price. For me it's about something completely different.For more than 5 months, the numerous bugs haven't really changed to the better at all. In just under 5 hours with the new patch, I've seen the same problems, even worsened in some cases.... . Especially in sieges. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... . Still invisible enemies, the AI with completely stupid deployment in cities! Ungrim Ironfists Journeys End still doesn't work. Waaagh! of orc AI factions in battles still not working. Pathfinding in sieges still incredibly bad. STILL! Also, it seems the performance on the campaign map has worsened again. Movement of the vampirates seems buggy, also the rites of the vampirates. Frigg, I don't want to list everything... .The DLC looks really good and great, but if you put more resources into new stuff like the Intel thing instead of fixing the old and known problems/bugs, then I don't see the point in buying the DLC. In fact, I won't be buying any more DLC until something improves in terms of the endless bugs. In my case, the new stuff is not relevant right now.I encourage everyone here to reconsider their buying habits. For God's sake, stop pre-ordering everything! That's one of the reasons why the quality is getting worse every year.CA, get your act together or this will be an even bigger ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than it already is. As long as nothing changes, I will not recommend the game.Edit:As of today, 08/17/2023, nothing has fundamentally changed. And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, today's official statement from CA... .

"2022 Great game, definitely worth the money in playtime. Huge world to explore and hundreds of hours of playtime.Is it a great game? yes. Is it a masterpiece? totally no, most people that say so, they're either still on the honeymoon phase or haven't left the starting zone yet.The game has lots of content to explore. The world building, level design and lore is some of the best in souls series. Gorgeous views, super complex domains to get lost into. Lots of secrets and surprises when exploring the open world. At least on the first couple of areas.Sadly the quality dips a bit after around half the game, and the open world areas start to feel more generic fields with stuff thrown around.This applies as well to the boss design. The quality dips down on the second half of the game, and there are notable design problems. First, the lack of originality, since every boss has basically the same moveset: every boss has a big AoE that oneshots, every boss throws puddles of poison/dots around the arena, every boss has a grab attack that oneshots, every boss has an anime multihitting unrollable dash that you need to run away from... Also if you're one of those people who disliked DS2 for the ganks, I got bad news for you, cause again past the midpoint of the game, they just started doing ctr+c ctrl+v to most of the early game bosses, so you'll have to face 2 or 3 at the same time.Then some other boss fights are straight up bugged or clunky. From bosses too big to fit the room where you are fighting, making them glitch through the walls or the floor, to bosses that you fight in the open world that can get bugged with height changes on the terrain, making them glitch up and down from rocks or cliffs.If you are interested in pvp, other than duels, there isn't much going on. Covenants are gone, and invasions only work if the host is playing coop. And as of the day of the review, there are several instant kill cheap builds ruining the scene that hopefully will get patched.Personally I'd give it an 8/10. Is a great game, specially if you want to get into souls games, since the open world design allows to take it easy and progress somewhere else if you get stuck, plus there are several new systems added to make the game more accessible. This also sadly lowered the quality of boss fights, which is the biggest appeal for me.",great game definit worth money playtim huge world explor hundr hour playtimei great game ye masterpiec total peopl say theyr either still honeymoon phase havent left start zone yetth game lot content explor world build level design lore best soul seri gorgeou view super complex domain get lost lot secret surpris explor open world least first coupl areassadli qualiti dip bit around half game open world area start feel gener field stuff thrown aroundthi appli well boss design qualiti dip second half game notabl design problem first lack origin sinc everi boss basic moveset everi boss big aoe oneshot everi boss throw puddl poisondot around arena everi boss grab attack oneshot everi boss anim multihit unrol dash need run away also your one peopl dislik gank got bad news caus past midpoint game start ctrc ctrlv earli game boss youll face timethen boss fight straight bug clunki boss big fit room fight make glitch wall floor boss fight open world get bug height chang terrain make glitch rock cliffsif interest pvp duel isnt much go coven gone invas work host play coop day review sever instant kill cheap build ruin scene hope get patchedperson id give great game special want get soul game sinc open world design allow take easi progress somewher els get stuck plu sever new system ad make game access also sadli lower qualiti boss fight biggest appeal

"I have been following Black Myth Wukong since its first footage reveal during development... I watched summaries and adaptations of Journey to The West and this game by far is the most artistic, and beautiful tributes to the Mythology. Story: A little confusing unless you have knowledge on Wukong's lore, but the animations inbetween chapter clears were wonderful, the True Ending was really neat but it requires alot of things to be done such as beating all secret bosses and doing certain quests.Gameplay: It's not bad, there's alot of cool moves you can do but the boss quality is variable, sometimes there are annoying bosses, sometimes there are fun and challenging ones. Looking up guides is helpful to understand where to go or what to build. Versatile upgrade systems.Graphics: I need not say anything else, Unreal Engine 5 displayed wonderfully, vibrant and realistic graphics I couldn't be happier with the performance on my 3080.Music: Top notch, very heartfelt in certain moments.Overall 8.5/10I would give it a better score if the boss quality was consistent.",follow black myth wukong sinc first footag reveal develop watch summari adapt journey west game far artist beauti tribut mytholog stori littl confus unless knowledg wukong lore anim inbetween chapter clear wonder true end realli neat requir alot thing done beat secret boss certain questsgameplay bad there alot cool move boss qualiti variabl sometim annoy boss sometim fun challeng one look guid help understand go build versatil upgrad systemsgraph need say anyth els unreal engin display wonder vibrant realist graphic couldnt happier perform top notch heartfelt certain momentsoveral would give better score boss qualiti consist
"2022 One of the few modern AAA games you can buy at full price and get a huge amount of hours per dollar paid.This is Dark Souls ramped up. The world is bigger, the weapons are crazier, the bosses have more BS moves then before and there is just sooooo much to find in the game. Don't go thinking this will be an easier game straight away. It IS easier but not for any mechanical or gameplay reason. It's easier because you can just bypass most roadblocks and go exploring, find more materials and weapons and get levels much easier then previous Souls games. The actual fights will still be challenging and require you to spend time learning boss attack patterns.The game design overall is still ""hard but fair"" but be aware that by ""fair"" they now mean you can utilise just as much broken stuff as the enemies can, and not utilising it will often hamstring yourself.Overall it's still not that super tight DS1 design, but it's so, so much larger in scale that it's it's own beast and an absolutely amazing game to play.",one modern aaa game buy full price get huge amount hour per dollar paidthi dark soul ramp world bigger weapon crazier boss bs move sooooo much find game dont go think easier game straight away easier mechan gameplay reason easier bypass roadblock go explor find materi weapon get level much easier previou soul game actual fight still challeng requir spend time learn boss attack patternsth game design overal still hard fair awar fair mean utilis much broken stuff enemi utilis often hamstr yourselfoveral still super tight design much larger scale beast absolut amaz game play
"2022 Elden Ring on PC is a technical mess and I can't recommend it. The world, Bosses, and Core Gameplay look great but the issues are simply unacceptable for this age of gaming. A 60FPS cap in 2022 is ridiculous, And unfortunately even a stable 60 seems unachievable. With a Ryzen 5900x and a RTX 2080 I encountered FPS Drops, Stuttering, and a Unresponsive and frustrating to navigate menu. For some reason it Shows PlayStation Controller inputs with both my Xbox Controller and M&K. Don't bother Playing on M&K as it has some insane delay and acceleration that makes it unplayable. Also less important but should be mentioned: co-op in this game is awful. The need to use fingers to group up and then regroup whenever you do bosses or enter a dungeon. Progression in co-op is only for the host, so you have to run it for every party member in your group to not be locked out. I know this system is in Dark Souls but this is a new IP and having advertised co-op i expected a much better system. It's really disappointing it hasn't improved after all these years.",elden ring pc technic mess cant recommend world boss core gameplay look great issu simpli unaccept age game cap ridicul unfortun even stabl seem unachiev ryzen rtx encount fp drop stutter unrespons frustrat navig menu reason show playstat control input xbox control mk dont bother play mk insan delay acceler make unplay also less import mention coop game aw need use finger group regroup whenev boss enter dungeon progress coop host run everi parti member group lock know system dark soul new ip advertis coop expect much better system realli disappoint hasnt improv year
"2023 It's really disheartening to see the direction CA has been taking with their DLC as of late. Even with the extra work that was put in campaign features, Shadows of Change feels like a DLC that should have cost $15 instead of $25 given the amount of units it adds. The price could have been justified if they at least added more units and generic lords/heroes, but even though the content that's currently in the DLC is amazing, the price is just incredibly overbearing. I deeply hope that CA will look at the community outcry as something to learn from. If Thrones of Decay will be $25 as well, then I hope they at least go the extra mile in creating more units and generic lord/heroes to make it worth the price.",realli dishearten see direct ca take dlc late even extra work put campaign featur shadow chang feel like dlc cost instead given amount unit add price could justifi least ad unit gener lordshero even though content that current dlc amaz price incred overbear deepli hope ca look commun outcri someth learn throne decay well hope least go extra mile creat unit gener lordhero make worth price

"2023 I've been a huge fan of the Total War series ever since Shogun Total War. When they made the first Warhammer Total War I was over the moon which was followed by an improved Warhammer Total War 2.Sadly Warhammer Total War 3 does not live up to the previous installments. The launch was a failure filled with bugs, and the new campaign took the worst of the mechanics from the previous game and made them worse (Timed rush for souls).The siege rework was not an improvement. The adding of deployable towers and walls in the settlement doesnt add to the game, but rather subtracts. Whilst the enemy is marching on your gates, and you should be setting up your own men, you are busy either trying to locate the towers or walls to build or just ignoring the mechanic in it's entirety. The AI has changed from game 2 and again to the worse. It feels more dumb and passive in some regards, and also some things are just ludicrous - Enemy moving an army all the way across the map through enemy territory, just to assault you.Futhermore the prices of the new DLC are not worth the money they ask for them. There has been a huge price increase which just signals greed.All in all - avoid buying this and stick with the previous installments.

There's no limit to the class you play. Can't wait to see what more they plan to add to it.Now for the only negativity I have for this game. The Operations. They're alright, it's simply another campaign that goes along with the main campaign and adds some context here and there and it's pretty fun. If you're into immersion though and think you're your own space marine, tough luck. You're still seen as an Ultramarine. The actual main downside with Operations in my opinion is locking classes if a player has chosen it first. I see no reason to do this when other games like Darktide allow it. I get that these classes are apparently actual characters in the Ultramarine chapter, but it's such an irritating block. You'll have two brothers who want to be the same class and neither of them wish to change, forcing a third player to just stand and wait until one decides to finally leave the lobby. It's infuriating.It's an amazing game that brings a huge win for the Warhammer 40,000 franchise and I really hope it has a good life with future content.

"Between 7-8/10. The game is as good as god of war. It genuinely looks incredible. It plays pretty good. With minor exceptions the bosses are fair and usually can be beaten after changing your loadout. You don't have to farm and you can't ""outlevel"" your bosses like e.q. nearly every souls-like game.The game has huge technical problems that will lead to your cpu usage to be at 100% in certain places.It isn't perfect but still very fun and enjoyable.The hit- and hurtboxes are atrocious and even worse than dark souls 2, but still didn't take away the fun you can have fun with this game.",game good god war genuin look incred play pretti good minor except boss fair usual beaten chang loadout dont farm cant outlevel boss like eq nearli everi soulslik gameth game huge technic problem lead cpu usag certain placesit isnt perfect still fun enjoyableth hit hurtbox atroci even wors dark soul still didnt take away fun fun game
"2023 Steam needs to add 2 more review things under ""recent"" and ""all"", for ""Developer"" and ""Publisher"".I can't in my right mind support CA after finding out all the stuff I did today, and I have never really liked SEGA with all the crap they pull. (basically all publishers suck though...)I highly enjoy this game, when I am actually able to play it, that's a fact...But this will likely be the last game I buy in this series, assuming more even get made. I have the two previous games and (probably?) about half of the DLC's for each. I bought The Ogre Kingdoms for this game as well. Even though I own some DLC's though, the literal ONLY race I play 99% of the time is dwarves, and 80% of the time it's Karaz A Karak (other 20% is the Rune guy at the bottom of the map lol). I dont' have any real need/desire to actually get these DLCs other than supporting the development. I bought the DLCs because I wanted to support the devs, but I think it's time for me to stop even having this mindset. Everyone, buying the DLCs does 0% money to devs, it goes to the company and then pays whatever they pay from there. It DOES show the big companies that it's worth making more DLC, or that it's worth making new games, but it doesn't help the individual developers. The Developers who pour their blood into the game don't get anything more than their salary from big corporate games like this, and if we don't want this half finished game stuff to keep going, like it has been for a while now in the AA and AAA space, we need to stop allowing this. We need to vote with our wallets. No pre-ordering. No extra money after launch. Nothing. Many people I know, and formerly myself a while back, seem to feel that buying random DLC and micro-transactions is like tipping at a restaurant... but it's not. The programmers, artists, etc.... they never see that money unless the company makes more than god and they get some pittance of a bonus.",steam need add review thing recent develop publisheri cant right mind support ca find stuff today never realli like sega crap pull basic publish suck thoughi highli enjoy game actual abl play that factbut like last game buy seri assum even get made two previou game probabl half dlc bought ogr kingdom game well even though dlc though liter race play time dwarv time karaz karak rune guy bottom map lol dont real needdesir actual get dlc support develop bought dlc want support dev think time stop even mindset everyon buy dlc money dev goe compani pay whatev pay show big compani worth make dlc worth make new game doesnt help individu develop develop pour blood game dont get anyth salari big corpor game like dont want half finish game stuff keep go like aa aaa space need stop allow need vote wallet preorder extra money launch noth mani peopl know formerli back seem feel buy random dlc microtransact like tip restaur programm artist etc never see money unless compani make god get pittanc bonu

"2017 It's legit one of the worst games of all time. (I rate it 1/10, even that's too high)Let me explain why:- The anti-cheat systemThere is no need to explain how bad it is. It's so bad, that people are getting banned instantly for using skinchanger, but a friend of mine got OVERWATCH banned (not even vac) 7 (!) months after he started cheating. Good job valve. Oh btw, it was a public hack, he didn't even pay a single cent for it.- The communityIt's cancer overall. Seriously, so many people in the community are either toxic, can't speak English, or are just trolling around and thinking that's fun. I lost so many ranks and matches just because some c*nts don't speak any language or don't even speak at all (yes, there are people who don't even talk to you). If you kill someone in a cheeky way, you are called a cheater instantly. - The matchmaking systemLet me explain it: You are playing with 4 other people (which can be your mates aswell if you queue with them) against 5 opponents. Basically, it's meant to be competitive. But in some cases the matches are so one-sided, that it makes you rage so hard that your neighbours call the police at 2 a.m. Ranking up takes up to 17 wins in a row (I had to win 17 games in a row to rank up to global), but you can rank down 3 ranks after a lose (happened to a mate of mine). It's absolute bullsh*t, and don't even bother trying to play.- The servers64 tick, extreme lags, hitreg and server delay are enough cancer. But there are some bugs which are so weird and wtf that it's ?? For example, there used to be a glitch that if you spammed a buy bind, that you spawned as a spectator. IN MATCHMAKING FFS. If there are such glitches and volvo still doesn't care and add sh*tty gloves, you know that it's over.- Valve itselfAs mentioned earlier, they don't give a sh*t about anything the community says. They used to care about the community back then in 2013, when skins weren't even added yet.In 2014, they added the CZ-75. It was legit better than rifles. For 300 dollars... A pistol... It took them 8 months to nerf it, until it was nerfed to hard that it was rekt completely.In 2015, they added the revolvo. It was a pocket awp. It had the same stats as the awp, before it was nerfed 2 days later. After this, it was clear that valve doesn't give a sh*t about anyone. They kept adding stuff like graffitis, gloves, new skins...In 2017, they still don't care about anything. They ""UPDATED"" the negev. Great update.In conclusion, please don't play it. It's not worth your time.",legit one worst game time rate even that highlet explain anticheat systemther need explain bad bad peopl get ban instantli use skinchang friend mine got overwatch ban even vac month start cheat good job valv oh btw public hack didnt even pay singl cent communityit cancer overal serious mani peopl commun either toxic cant speak english troll around think that fun lost mani rank match cnt dont speak languag dont even speak ye peopl dont even talk kill someon cheeki way call cheater instantli matchmak systemlet explain play peopl mate aswel queue oppon basic meant competit case match onesid make rage hard neighbour call polic rank take win row win game row rank global rank rank lose happen mate mine absolut bullsht dont even bother tri play tick extrem lag hitreg server delay enough cancer bug weird wtf exampl use glitch spam buy bind spawn spectat matchmak ff glitch volvo still doesnt care add shtti glove know valv itselfa mention earlier dont give sht anyth commun say use care commun back skin werent even ad yetin ad legit better rifl dollar pistol took month nerf nerf hard rekt completelyin ad revolvo pocket awp stat awp nerf day later clear valv doesnt give sht anyon kept ad stuff like graffiti glove new skinsin still dont care anyth updat negev great updatein conclus pleas dont play worth time

"its terrrible. At least if you like gameplay over visuals. Here are some of the things that makes it a low tier DS clone:Game is mostly a boss rush but fighting the bosses arent fun. very little downtime between bosses. Mostly just spam dodge since they have very bad tells and 0-frame attacks.the combat is floaty where dodges arent the same. 1. is good, second is okay i think and then the 3rd have a delay between getting to dodge again.It has both immortal weapons from nioh and an immobalize spell you can use on bosses, so most of the time you are just waiting for that to come back online. You have light and heavy attacks but some light attacks take muuuch longer to finish so you have to try and just use light attack 2 time and then dodge to reset combo. Also at a boss that has an ability that hits a bigger area than the visual indicate and can go invulvuable and if in a bad part of the arena attacks faster than intended so you cant even dodge spam to avoid dmg.furthermore took an ability that should let me negate incomming dmg if i heavy strike combo but that dosent seem to work.Many of the bosses also have that elden ring boss design where they stop mid swing and then hit with all the momentum as if they dident stop.Camera tracking is ♥♥♥♥, a lot of the time the boss is only half visible on the side of the screen after dodging attack past thenso with all these tings i would consider bad. there isent anything good except its mytholigy and boss visuals that are new.",terrribl least like gameplay visual thing make low tier ds clonegam mostli boss rush fight boss arent fun littl downtim boss mostli spam dodg sinc bad tell attacksth combat floati dodg arent good second okay think delay get dodg againit immort weapon nioh immob spell use boss time wait come back onlin light heavi attack light attack take muuuch longer finish tri use light attack time dodg reset combo also boss abil hit bigger area visual indic go invulvu bad part arena attack faster intend cant even dodg spam avoid dmgfurthermor took abil let negat incom dmg heavi strike combo dosent seem workmani boss also elden ring boss design stop mid swing hit momentum dident stopcamera track lot time boss half visibl side screen dodg attack past thenso ting would consid bad isent anyth good except mytholigi boss visual new

"2022 Despite many flaws, TWW3 has finally managed what no other total warhammer in the series has yet. It made me complete (multiple) campaigns.The warhammer series is like a slow cooked brisket, and looking back at its predecessors, I'm happy to see how far we've come. Warhammer 1 inspired many of us with the promise of a vast trilogy capturing the entire fantasy world in all its chaos. Warhammer 2 built on that legacy. CA finally found their stride and a newfound freedom to experiment with a host of wacky and inspiring faction mechanics. Yet as time passed and other historical total war titles where released, Warhammer 2 started to feel dated. Lacklustre diplomacy, a seemingly abandoned multiplayer co-op mode, tedious sieges and a vortex campaign I could never find much reason to care for in the face of the immortal empires sandbox. If not for the staggering replay-ability of its factions and mods, I would not have spent as much time as I did with it.Warhammer 3 has finally introduced many of the QoL improvements so desperately needed to re-invigorate my enthusiasm for this game.Elaborate siege maps, Lord speeches, diplomacy improvements, beautiful visuals, faction unique theme music, unique faction mechanics and a simultaneous turn multiplayer campaign mode that stands head and should above the prequals. The highlight for me thus far has been the multiplayer campaigns, and the potential of this mode only grows with the promise of the immortal empires campaign. I find myself engaging with TWW3 in a way that TWW1 and TWW2 are unable to achieve. Time is precious, and all the new multiplayer tools available ensure that battling your friends or fighting alongside them has never been better and/or easier. All this improvement hasn't come without downsides. Unit responsiveness, a number of uninspiring technologies, predictable AI and a campaign objective which can at times feel forced and intrusive do tarnish an otherwise excellent experience. That said, as a person with hundreds of campaigns that have ended prematurely, having a cultivated finale is refreshing as opposed to the, at times, directionless mess of immortal empires. I've enjoyed my experience with TWW3 thus far and am eagerly awaiting the release of the immortal empires campaign. It goes without saying that the delivery of the immortal empires campaign could make or break this series. Regardless of the outcome however, I've had a blast dabbling in CA's rendition of the Warhammer fantasy world. It's portrayal is vast and comprehensive and something we are unlikely to experience ever again in such careful detail.",despit mani flaw final manag total warhamm seri yet made complet multipl campaignsth warhamm seri like slow cook brisket look back predecessor im happi see far weve come warhamm inspir mani us promis vast trilog captur entir fantasi world chao warhamm built legaci ca final found stride newfound freedom experi host wacki inspir faction mechan yet time pass histor total war titl releas warhamm start feel date lacklustr diplomaci seemingli abandon multiplay coop mode tediou sieg vortex campaign could never find much reason care face immort empir sandbox stagger replay faction mod would spent much time itwarhamm final introduc mani qol improv desper need reinvigor enthusiasm gameelabor sieg map lord speech diplomaci improv beauti visual faction uniqu theme music uniqu faction mechan simultan turn multiplay campaign mode stand head prequal highlight thu far multiplay campaign potenti mode grow promis immort empir campaign find engag way unabl achiev time preciou new multiplay tool avail ensur battl friend fight alongsid never better andor easier improv hasnt come without downsid unit respons number uninspir technolog predict ai campaign object time feel forc intrus tarnish otherwis excel experi said person hundr campaign end prematur cultiv final refresh oppos time directionless mess immort empir ive enjoy experi thu far eagerli await releas immort empir campaign goe without say deliveri immort empir campaign could make break seri regardless outcom howev ive blast dabbl ca rendit warhamm fantasi world portray vast comprehens someth unlik experi ever care detail

"Product received for free Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 – A Brutal War in the Grim Darkness of the Future! (ฅ'ω'ฅ)""An exhilarating, gory, and action-packed sequel that lives up to the scale of the Warhammer 40K universe, but with some notable flaws in balance and technical polish.""[1] Intro : Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 thrusts players into the brutal and unrelenting world of the Warhammer 40K universe, continuing the tale of the Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. Developed by Saber Interactive, this third-person action game places you in the superhuman armor of a Space Marine as you combat the horrifying Tyranid swarm in intense, blood-soaked battles. Building on the success of its predecessor, Space Marine 2 offers solo and co-op gameplay, featuring both player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player (PvP) modes to keep the action fresh and chaotic.[2] Game Experience : The moment you step into Titus' power armor, the scale of Space Marine 2’s combat becomes apparent. The game’s standout feature is its seamless combination of gunplay and melee combat, allowing players to switch between devastating bolter shots and brutal close-quarters executions. The spectacle of mowing down endless Tyranid swarms is both thrilling and terrifying, thanks to the sheer number of enemies onscreen, powered by Saber’s Swarm Engine.The visuals are equally impressive, capturing the grim, gothic aesthetic of the 40K universe. From the ruined hive cities to the expansive battlefields littered with the corpses of xenos and humans alike, the game never shies away from its dark atmosphere. The orchestral score and guttural sounds of bolters firing and chainswords revving heighten the sense of chaos, making every battle feel cinematic.However, the combat system, while exhilarating, does suffer from balance issues. Melee attacks dominate the battlefield, often making ranged weapons feel underpowered, particularly when faced with larger enemies. The tactical depth you'd expect from wielding the mighty bolter or plasma gun is somewhat diminished by their lack of punch, especially when it inexplicably takes a full magazine to down a basic Tyranid warrior. This can lead to frustrating moments, especially for players who prefer a ranged combat style.The co-op and PvP modes are a welcome addition, extending the game’s replayability. Operations, the co-op missions, allow players to team up with friends to tackle harder challenges, but the real test comes in the PvP mode, Eternal War, where teams of Space Marines face off against the forces of Chaos. Both modes offer progression systems with plenty of unlockable perks and cosmetics, though the limited variety in mission design can make long play sessions feel repetitive.[3] Pros and Cons : (+) Pros Incredible Atmosphere: The game nails the Warhammer 40K vibe with dark, grim visuals and an immersive soundscape. Fast-Paced Combat: The combat system is brutal, fast, and satisfying, especially for fans of melee action. Co-op and PvP Modes: Operations and Eternal War offer extensive replay value, particularly when played with friends. Enemy Variety: The Tyranids and Chaos forces present varied and challenging foes with unique behaviors and attack patterns.(-) Cons Weapon Imbalance: Ranged weapons often feel underpowered, making melee combat the dominant strategy. Technical Issues: Bugs, including floating objects and texture pop-ins, disrupt the immersion. Weightless Power Armor: The lack of impact when moving in power armor detracts from the feeling of being a superhuman warrior. Co-op Limitations: Progress in co-op isn’t always saved for non-host players, leading to frustration for those playing the campaign with friends.[4] Final Thoughts : Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 delivers on its promise of fast, bloody, and exhilarating combat in the vast and unforgiving Warhammer 40K universe. The game’s atmospheric design, gripping story, and expansive multiplayer modes make it a must-play for fans of the franchise and action games alike. However, the imbalance between melee and ranged combat, along with some technical glitches, prevent it from reaching its full potential.For those who love diving into the lore of Warhammer or who are looking for a gory, action-packed co-op experience, Space Marine 2 is a solid recommendation. Just don’t expect a perfectly polished experience or to rely heavily on your bolter.[5] Side Note : Nyanco Channel?

"2022 I still can’t believe my GTX 1050 (i5 8th gen, 8GB Ram) can run this game with 1080p, 30 FPS . It’s NOT amazing numbers but hey, it’s playable for me. I can easily fight bosses and mobs without issues or heavy stuttering. SO, writing this early review to give hope to all GTX 1050 players!! GOOD LUCK! Amazing game so far.Edit: I completed the game and I must say, WOW! The world is so vast and boundless and went way beyond what I expected initially.. also, the sheer number of bosses scattered around the map was truly astounding! Every boss that I defeated made me feel like on top of the world just as always in every soulslike games...The thing I'm most amazed about the game is how the open world didn't feel empty nor repetitive..all bosses or mobs in different areas looked different and had different skillsets.. As a big fan of open worlds, Elden Ring didn't disappoint at all.. TRULY deserving of a GOTY. I've already played other souls-like games so ER wasn't too difficult for me except for a few bosses.. but it might pose a challenge for new players.. One thing tho.. with Mimic Tear, the game becomes easier.. by a lot. And if you face too much difficulty, just look up meta overpowered builds (currently, bleed ones i think) and your game will be a breeze from then on.

"Playing this, gave me the same amount of excitement when I played God of war (2018) for the very first time. Being the first AAA title from the developer, I think they pretty much nailed it.This is what I was able to gather during my short playtime.Pros:1. A+ combat mechanics. Easy enough to learn, complex enough to keep it interesting.2. Art and sound direction are on point. Absolutely stunning. Especially the variety of bosses.3. Well optimized. I'm averaging 70-80 fps in high settings on my Zephyrus G14 4060.4. The skill point system is well thought of. Rewards you even if you keep dying when doing boss rush. Cons:1. I wished the game had mo-caped for English dialogues and had better dialogues in general. It kinda throws me off when the characters talk.

"2022 Product refunded I want to like this game but its seriously un-optimized and at this point in time, I would expect the game to look better overall.

"I mean, of course I recommend it. It's free, fun, and has a super healthy monetisation system.It's actually pretty good. I haven't really been gnashed by the MUSTPLAYMOAR bug, but the game mechanics are great. It's survival crafting with big boss fights. But survival/crafting lite to be fair. The game mechanics and systems are great. I've not had any frustrating moments. I feel like my time is respected. QOL features are really through the roof.As for the feel of the game it's like... Fallout76 (but released in a good state) meets The Secret World. Some cool horror/great old one content mixed with Survival crafting light and elements of Palworld and Conan Exiles thrown in. It's a mixture of a lot of great features from a lot of great games.There's a lot of infantile internet rage being thrown at it for the way it has planned seasons, and I'm not thrilled with the way it sounds it's going to work either, but I'll play it and enjoy it and when the season ends, if I really hate what they are doing and they offer no alternate options, I'll go play something else.The only true criticism I can direct at it is that it's easy. It's hard to feel challenged. You are soft-gated into following the story but if you want a challenge you need to go play in regions 10 levels above you. But you cant progress those areas without completing the prior areas which will level you up to be level appropriate for the next region. Hopefully they will release some hardmode servers next season.",mean cours recommend free fun super healthi monetis systemit actual pretti good havent realli gnash mustplaymoar bug game mechan great surviv craft big boss fight survivalcraft lite fair game mechan system great ive frustrat moment feel like time respect qol featur realli roofa feel game like releas good state meet secret world cool horrorgreat old one content mix surviv craft light element palworld conan exil thrown mixtur lot great featur lot great gamesther lot infantil internet rage thrown way plan season im thrill way sound go work either ill play enjoy season end realli hate offer altern option ill go play someth elseth true critic direct easi hard feel challeng softgat follow stori want challeng need go play region level cant progress area without complet prior area level level appropri next region hope releas hardmod server next season

"9/10A masterpiece that effortlessly blends breathtaking visuals, exhilarating combat, and a captivating narrative. From the moment I stepped into the vibrant world inspired by Journey to the West, I was completely immersed. The game's graphics are simply stunning. Every detail, from the lush forests to the intricate architectures is rendered with meticulous care. All the elements of the game: animations, cutscenes, music, UI, portraits and gameplay were equally impressive.IMO, if you want to really feel what the ""hype"" is about, then you play this game at the highest possible graphic settings (High -> Cinematic) that your PC spec allows you to.If it's not , then I would suggest to play this game maybe 5~10 years from now in which the current high-end GPUs that you can upgrade into.-----Combat/Enemy:There's no difficulty selection in this game so your experience may vary on how easy or difficult you can progress throughout chapters. But despite the struggles, I enjoyed the trial & errors from learning the combos, perfect dodge, and attack timings from boss attacks. It took me 78 hours to finish the game which includes secret locations/bosses from Chapters 1~5 (yes, including secret ending).Apparently, not all bosses were created equally, some of them were quite annoying in terms of their hit box (YEP, I'M LOOKING AT YOU ""Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master"", YOU PRICK!) but still I enjoyed trying to learn and adapt to different attack tempos, mechanics, and changing my playstyle if the situation needs to. Overall, I think 90% of the boss encounters I have good experience.Perfect dodge mechanic is what I also like about in this game, it's a high-risk high-reward kind of maneuver to pull because you need to get hit before you dodge NOT dodging before you get hit kind of thing, it gives me the sense of fulfillment when everytime I am learning the attack timings from the boss. Alternatively, there are different staff skills/stance that allows you to parry or dodge which varies from your playstyle.Transformations were also really cool! Although I only used quite few of them because of personal preferences with their added buffs.The armors and weapons are fairly balanced in this game some of them are situational or will vary to your playstyle and some armor gives unique effect without having to wear a set. But overall it's really good.Story:The game's story adapted from the ""Journey to the West"" novel but not in its entirety, you don't really need to read the novel to understand what the story is about since this game takes a different route for its own franchise hence part of the name ""Black Myth"", atleast from what I've observed, this game takes place after the events in the novel + some twists.The animation & cutscenes really exceeded my expectations, it has a balance amount of cutscenes from actual gameplay and it gives you that immersion to Chinese mythologies.Exploration:The level design is god-tier, every detail is meticulously created from lush forests to intricate architectures, it's just simply stunning.Also, I cant' stress this enough but exploring really pays off in this game! It will either reward you an upgrade or a secret boss encounters so definitely a huge W for people who are into exploration.----Overall, despite my experience of playing the game in a lower than 60 FPS (and mostly unstable), I think it really outweighs the level of effort that the game developers have poured into this game in terms of ""next-gen"" graphics, they really pushed the limits of Unreal Engine 5 to the point that there are technical limitations from the game engine itself. My commendation is not only solely to the graphics but to other aspects of the game as well the quality of animation, cutscenes, music, and level design they have delivered exceeds expectations.This is a must-play for fans of action-adventure games and Chinese mythology. It's a game that will leave a lasting impression for its breathtaking visuals, exhilarating combat, and a captivating narrative.",masterpiec effortlessli blend breathtak visual exhilar combat captiv narr moment step vibrant world inspir journey west complet immers game graphic simpli stun everi detail lush forest intric architectur render meticul care element game anim cutscen music ui portrait gameplay equal impressiveimo want realli feel hype play game highest possibl graphic set high cinemat pc spec allow toif would suggest play game mayb year current highend gpu upgrad intocombatenemyther difficulti select game experi may vari easi difficult progress throughout chapter despit struggl enjoy trial error learn combo perfect dodg attack time boss attack took hour finish game includ secret locationsboss chapter ye includ secret endingappar boss creat equal quit annoy term hit box yep im look hundredey daoist master prick still enjoy tri learn adapt differ attack tempo mechan chang playstyl situat need overal think boss encount good experienceperfect dodg mechan also like game highrisk highreward kind maneuv pull need get hit dodg dodg get hit kind thing give sens fulfil everytim learn attack time boss altern differ staff skillsstanc allow parri dodg vari playstyletransform also realli cool although use quit person prefer ad buffsth armor weapon fairli balanc game situat vari playstyl armor give uniqu effect without wear set overal realli goodstoryth game stori adapt journey west novel entireti dont realli need read novel understand stori sinc game take differ rout franchis henc part name black myth atleast ive observ game take place event novel twiststh anim cutscen realli exceed expect balanc amount cutscen actual gameplay give immers chines mythologiesexplorationth level design godtier everi detail meticul creat lush forest intric architectur simpli stunningalso cant stress enough explor realli pay game either reward upgrad secret boss encount definit huge w peopl explorationoveral despit experi play game lower fp mostli unstabl think realli outweigh level effort game develop pour game term nextgen graphic realli push limit unreal engin point technic limit game engin commend sole graphic aspect game well qualiti anim cutscen music level design deliv exce expectationsthi mustplay fan actionadventur game chines mytholog game leav last impress breathtak visual exhilar combat captiv narr

"2023 This is tale of modern gaming developers and publishers. Taking a beautifully well-done game, clearly the product of equal parts passion and skill, and slowly choking the promise and life out of it through corporate greed. I'm not surprised. It is everywhere today, not just in gaming. But what is so fascinating to me is that this same greed that is killing companies the world over could be sated by a few good consumer-focused decisions. They could, with a little hard work, have their cake and eat it too. I know what is happening. The business side of the company made the determination that raising prices and reducing content, ignoring bugs and focusing on new content, is the most profitable and efficient method of doing business. Less work, more money. After all, the company needs profit to survive. But this model of thinking is grossly short-sighted. I would ask the stakeholders of the company the following question: Which is preferred? A 100% increase in profits in the next fiscal year from WH3, but due to horrific understanding of the consumer base, the game dies on the vine, and the player count (and population of consumers of future content) decreases to the point where it is no longer viable to continue supporting the game within two years.-OR-A slow increase of 10% profit per quarter over the next 5 fiscal years, shoring up a rock-solid foundation of consumers who will loyally purchase every release of content for the entire life-cycle of the game. Additionally, the community relations ensure that the next game in the franchise is eagerly anticipated and pre-ordered, continuing to grow the company exponentially. Everyone is picking the first option and not even considering the second, even though long-term, that would be the most profitable decision, and the most welcomed by the consumer. The problem is that the business side of the company does not understand how the money is made. You do not succeed in business by spitting in the face of the customers who have spend hundreds of dollars on your products in the name of quarterly earnings. If you do that, you may not survive (financially) to see another quarter. You succeed by doubling down on the things which made you successful in the first place: attention to detail, understanding your community and communicating openly with them, and working tirelessly within your own company to produce a culture of full-spectrum consumer-focused effort rather than deadline-driven content generation (READ: bug fixes, community engagement media, and then quality DLC in equal measure rather than the current high-price low-content DLC rush). It is a circle of growth. The consumer sees what they want to see. The consumer spends their money on the products the company produces. The money is used to payroll the employees, increase the wealth of the stake-holders, and grow the company to produce more content in the same vein of what the consumer wants to see. And so on and so forth.But enough of my own analysis. If anyone from the company is reading this, I'll provide you some data points, and you can do your own analysis. I won't draw you any conclusions. I won't tell you WHY I stopped playing. But I'll tell you a little about what matters most to you (what I bought from the company) and WHEN exactly I stopped playing.I have purchased every single item in the Total War: Warhammer franchise except the Shadows of Change DLC. Most I purchased at full price, many I pre-ordered. As the time of this review, I had 86.9 hours on record in WHIII. I had 542.6 hours in WH2. I own every single Total War title in the franchise except Thrones of Britannia, Troy, and Pharaoh.I stopped playing WHIII when I noticed that the animations for the Witch Hunter and Free Company Militia (they share the same animation set) was completely broken. This was a year ago now. Simply put, their mouths do not open or move, their pistols were floating magically from their belts to their hands when swapping from idles to attacks, and eventually, their swords were invisible. Despite being reported by multiple users on both Steam and the forums, it was never even added to the known issues list. Eventually, a low-effort fix was pushed to bring the swords back, and to shove the pistols into the off-hand of the model. But to this very day, the grip of the pistol is horribly clipped into the thumb of the hand, and nothing was done to address their broken mouth rig. I purchased the Forge of the Chaos Dwarfs, but never played because the aforementioned bug wasn't addressed, and once I had noticed my favorite hero unit from my favorite faction was broken, it became too frustrating to ignore.I did not purchase Shadows of Change. So there you go. Analyze away. Why might I have stopped playing? Could there by a linkage between terrible community relations and profit? Could seemingly minor cosmetic bugs really cause someone to stop playing? Could ignoring issues like that (despite multiple reports and video evidence) create a perception of not caring about the player base so powerful it drives decisions to purchase future content? Could it be, after all this time, the little things which create success? Could this really be what kills a multi-million dollar franchise?There are thousands of other players just like me. If you can get my money, I think everyone wins. You included. I wish you nothing but the best. I'm rooting for you guys.",tale modern game develop publish take beauti welldon game clearli product equal part passion skill slowli choke promis life corpor greed im surpris everywher today game fascin greed kill compani world could sate good consumerfocus decis could littl hard work cake eat know happen busi side compani made determin rais price reduc content ignor bug focus new content profit effici method busi less work money compani need profit surviv model think grossli shortsight would ask stakehold compani follow question prefer increas profit next fiscal year due horrif understand consum base game die vine player count popul consum futur content decreas point longer viabl continu support game within two yearsora slow increas profit per quarter next fiscal year shore rocksolid foundat consum loyal purchas everi releas content entir lifecycl game addit commun relat ensur next game franchis eagerli anticip preorder continu grow compani exponenti everyon pick first option even consid second even though longterm would profit decis welcom consum problem busi side compani understand money made succeed busi spit face custom spend hundr dollar product name quarterli earn may surviv financi see anoth quarter succeed doubl thing made success first place attent detail understand commun commun openli work tirelessli within compani produc cultur fullspectrum consumerfocus effort rather deadlinedriven content gener read bug fix commun engag media qualiti dlc equal measur rather current highpric lowcont dlc rush circl growth consum see want see consum spend money product compani produc money use payrol employe increas wealth stakehold grow compani produc content vein consum want see forthbut enough analysi anyon compani read ill provid data point analysi wont draw conclus wont tell stop play ill tell littl matter bought compani exactli stop playingi purchas everi singl item total war warhamm franchis except shadow chang dlc purchas full price mani preorder time review hour record whiii hour everi singl total war titl franchis except throne britannia troy pharaohi stop play whiii notic anim witch hunter free compani militia share anim set complet broken year ago simpli put mouth open move pistol float magic belt hand swap idl attack eventu sword invis despit report multipl user steam forum never even ad known issu list eventu loweffort fix push bring sword back shove pistol offhand model day grip pistol horribl clip thumb hand noth done address broken mouth rig purchas forg chao dwarf never play aforement bug wasnt address notic favorit hero unit favorit faction broken becam frustrat ignorei purchas shadow chang go analyz away might stop play could linkag terribl commun relat profit could seemingli minor cosmet bug realli caus someon stop play could ignor issu like despit multipl report video evid creat percept care player base power drive decis purchas futur content could time littl thing creat success could realli kill multimillion dollar franchisether thousand player like get money think everyon win includ wish noth best im root guy

"I'll point out the same thing someone else said in a review. ""As someone who's put nearly 200 hours across the betas and tests. There's a severe abundance of misinformation being spread about the game so let's hit all the main points quickly, shall we? I'm losing precious game time having to respond to these goofballs"" - Within hours of launch, the team fixed the ability to create characters on other servers- The gacha ""Wish Machine"" is used to unlock blueprints of some powerful weapons and it is a gamble. THE ONLY TWO WAYS of receiving this currency is playing the game, and available in the FREE battle pass tiers. There's literally no way to exchange real money for this currency. You have to earn it.- Spyware/cryptominer claims is just baffling- The terms of service and privacy policy issue: one guy read it and everyone else is vomiting that information based on that person's findings. These terms are no different from the majority of other modern games you accept today.I'll update this review when I see more nonsense being spread.-My take on this. Yeah, they're 100% correct. I've played the betas and such before it hit steam. Half the nonsense you keep seeing about data is just idiotic. Firstly, steam wouldn't in no way allow such a title with a wide threat as deep as you say to even be here, period. Use common sense. As for the terms though? As the guy mentioned from the review I copied above, This is essentially... EVERY EULA ever, which I now half of you skip through as usual so you never knew or cared til one guy spoke up and said some bs about it. As for the game its self? The devs have listened to a lot of feed back from the tests! Loving the direction its going and far from the bore fest it kinda felt like before. As for over heating? Some people have CPU issues pegging their system at 100% usage, thats usually a ""YOU"" issue, look into it, other wise, yes it could be a bug, wait it out and see. My self?7900 XT , 7900X, 3440x1440, Running it maxed around 98-115+ fps ranges, Cpu sitting at 67c full time on air, The game hardly uses any CPU honestly, it sits at 3.5 to 3.8ghz vs its full 5.6 I see in most games. So I suggest some of you check your PBO or other boost scenarios. Might be your issue.As for intel? They do have an issue as intel stated themselves for quite a few engines out there.

Not very fun at all just getting your lands over run with portals, plague and Chaos armies. It sad I just use heroes to close the portals and never really bother entering them. It's sad CA does not take any outside input during Alpha. So much of this could of been play tested and improved before release. Like most others, I'm just waiting for Mortal Empires to be released.

"Space Marine 2 is a welcome addition to 40k games. It plays like the first, but in every way better (minus a couple technical issues I ran into). Space Marine gives you the power fantasy of being an Ultramarine with third person hack and slash combat and shooting. It feels very much like a fast paced Gears of War, but without the cover system, seeing as you're a walking tank. I don't know a lot of 40k lore, but the game does a very good job in immersing you in the world and showing you different sides to a very expansive franchise. It's made me want to get into the books and learn more. The game has several moments that strike you in awe, whether it's a mountain of Tyranids climbing up to kill you, or standing in the halls of an Imperial Battle Barge while listing to chanting religious fanatics appeal to the Machine God. Game ran alright on my system. Using a Ryzen 5 3600 and RTX 3060 Ti, I ran the game on high settings with DLSS rendering set to Quality. My game stayed in the 40s or 50s for the most part and dipped to the high 30s for some sequences, but I hardly noticed. I was too busy watching the execution animations. Far as technical issues, I ran into the ""joining server"" hug once, which they've said they've since fixed (and I haven't seen it again). There's also an issue with two players attempting to make an execution on an enemy at the same time where you will freeze in place until the other player completes another execution. I've had this happen twice. The first time I was stuck for almost a minute. The second time, less than 10 seconds. I've also had my friend crash once during a boss fight but he managed to restart him game and rejoin in the middle, so the drop in coop seems to work. I hope they add more content to the game soon, per their roadmap. I need more excuses to come back to the world of the Ultramarine.

"2022 If you are like me and hate the Souls games for being overly difficult and for always working against and not for the player, do give Elden Ring a try, you might end up loving it as much as I did.Before getting into the review I'd like to give my opinions some merit by saying that I played over 50 hours of Demon's Souls in 2010 on PS3, made decent progress too, then I played Lords of the Fallen on Steam(Not a From Soft game) and gave Sekiro a try and hated it. I also played a bit of the PS5 Demon's Souls remake.I have also tried other games with Souls mechanics and did not care for them one bit with the exception of Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order which had multiple difficulties and I loved from beginning to end.With that in mind, let's get into my Elden Ring review.Elden Ring is the single, best action RPG I have ever played bar none. I even took the time to ""Platinum"" the game which I pretty much never do. Sure it had its shortcomings but the overall experience was simply unmatched by anything.In order to keep it clean and easy to understand I will post pros and cons of the gamePros:- STUNNING Art Direction, the game looks like a moving painting at every turn. I was in awe from beginning to end- Even though the game has a rather sparse and vague storytelling, if you stick to quest lines you're actually going to relate to the characters and that's very sweet. They all have very little dialogue yet it's well written and acted enough to make the player care about them.- The game is full of AMAZING Random moments you wouldn't even think could occur- Incredible, epic, amazing boss fights- Fantastic gameplay that works FOR and not against the player unlike other Souls games which do everything they can to screw the player over- Essentially infinite healing items that only increase and get stronger as you explore the world- Weapons and armor don't break! Maintaining your equipment ruined so many games for me including Demon's Souls and even Breath of the Wild (I still finished BotW at least)- Very frequent checkpoints, a checkpoint before every major encounter- Specifically dedicated Farm Zones that make leveling up a breeze, they also have checkpoints right next to them- The world is full of content yet never once felt overwhelming or boring much less like some kind of a checklistSense of discovery like no other game before it, I was genuinely happy and excited to discover new dungeons, places, items, characters, vistas, everything is just so well put together it's incredible.- Brilliant eerie somber music and ambience that fit the world perfectly- Satisfying sound effects, from the sounds the main character makes as they walk or roll around to weapon clashes, hits, everything it's just perfect. With headphones on the game's sound helps with gameplay too.- Elden Ring lets the player make mistakes, experiment with fights, take risks without punishing them by wasting their time which is something other souls games doCons:- Quest lines could and should have been clearly outlined IMO, unless you follow a quest guide you have pretty much no chance of discovering or progressing through these quest lines- Some bosses were idiotic, mainly the 2nd form of the final boss and 2nd form of that one other boss tho her I dealt with by summoning two other players to help withMaking it complicated to get all three endings on a single file for console users, fortunately I was on PC so it was a nonissue for me- TERRIBLE CLUNKY MOVEMENT AND JUMPING which sadly comes into play in 2 optional areasMost spells, armors, items and weapons are fairly useless and only a few are worth using, so that's pretty disappointing- Unable to respec an unlimited number of times, you need respec items, I had 10 and used two I believe, but it would've been so much more fun if I could infinitely play with my build. You also need to find these items tho I seem to have found them without trying so there's thatMy final rating - 10/10An absolutely amazing experience, only marred by the final boss' 2nd phase for me----------------------------I still strongly dislike Souls Games for the following reasons, none of which are present as much in Elden Ring:- Even the slightest mistake can and will mess up your run in other Souls games, but not in Elden Ring- HP and MP healing items cost souls, souls take time to farm up, it's not your choice to farm, the game essentially makes you- Dying sets you back to the beginning of a level, if you opened up shortcuts cool but some levels don't have them, fighting the same damn enemies over and over is tedious when it is NOT your choice to do so. Meaning you are either perfect or you mess up, end up wasting healing items and what not just to die at the end of the segment and try again and again to no end.I play plenty of retro games, they give you far more room for mistake than the average Souls game.- Demon's Souls for example LOVES putting the player in small, narrow spaces with enemies. If you're melee good luck becuase your sword will bounce off walls, if the camera decides to mess up and it will, it's even worse. Elden Ring very rarely did this. Tho there were some camera issues in Elden Ring as well here and there but nothing major. - IIRC the more you die in Demon's Souls for example, the more difficult the game becomes, something about world tendency getting darker but I can't confirm this for sure, Elden Ring does none of this stuff.",like hate soul game overli difficult alway work player give elden ring tri might end love much didbefor get review id like give opinion merit say play hour demon soul made decent progress play lord fallen steamnot soft game gave sekiro tri hate also play bit demon soul remakei also tri game soul mechan care one bit except star war jedi fallen order multipl difficulti love begin endwith mind let get elden ring reviewelden ring singl best action rpg ever play bar none even took time platinum game pretti much never sure shortcom overal experi simpli unmatch anythingin order keep clean easi understand post pro con gamepro stun art direct game look like move paint everi turn awe begin end even though game rather spars vagu storytel stick quest line your actual go relat charact that sweet littl dialogu yet well written act enough make player care game full amaz random moment wouldnt even think could occur incred epic amaz boss fight fantast gameplay work player unlik soul game everyth screw player essenti infinit heal item increas get stronger explor world weapon armor dont break maintain equip ruin mani game includ demon soul even breath wild still finish botw least frequent checkpoint checkpoint everi major encount specif dedic farm zone make level breez also checkpoint right next world full content yet never felt overwhelm bore much less like kind checklistsens discoveri like game genuin happi excit discov new dungeon place item charact vista everyth well put togeth incred brilliant eeri somber music ambienc fit world perfectli satisfi sound effect sound main charact make walk roll around weapon clash hit everyth perfect headphon game sound help gameplay elden ring let player make mistak experi fight take risk without punish wast time someth soul game docon quest line could clearli outlin imo unless follow quest guid pretti much chanc discov progress quest line boss idiot mainli form final boss form one boss tho dealt summon two player help withmak complic get three end singl file consol user fortun pc nonissu terribl clunki movement jump sadli come play option areasmost spell armor item weapon fairli useless worth use that pretti disappoint unabl respec unlimit number time need respec item use two believ wouldv much fun could infinit play build also need find item tho seem found without tri there thatmi final rate absolut amaz experi mar final boss phase mei still strongli dislik soul game follow reason none present much elden ring even slightest mistak mess run soul game elden ring hp mp heal item cost soul soul take time farm choic farm game essenti make die set back begin level open shortcut cool level dont fight damn enemi tediou choic mean either perfect mess end wast heal item die end segment tri endi play plenti retro game give far room mistak averag soul game demon soul exampl love put player small narrow space enemi your mele good luck becuas sword bounc wall camera decid mess even wors elden ring rare tho camera issu elden ring well noth major iirc die demon soul exampl difficult game becom someth world tendenc get darker cant confirm sure elden ring none stuff

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

"2023 It is painful to write this review since i play total war games since rome total war yet here we go, again.. In order for someone to enjoy everything that this game has to offer, he has to pay 🥁🥁🥁 263€..Seriously, that's amazing that they can get out with this, but is it?Who enabled them to get this far? Well, we did it. Thinking that things will get better..With every broken release, we rewarded them with our money and they just kept going, and going without fixing any of the bugs, addressing the balance between the factions and so on.The first Warhammer total war was released back on 2016, it had its bugs yet it was a fresh installment in the franchise and most of us were exited with what was to come. Then came the first DLCs which were alarming but the ""hype"" was still strong.With the release of the 2nd Warhammer total war, they added a couple of factions and a new campaign and here is where it gets interesting. In every other title in the franchise that would be an expansion/DLC for the core game like the Age of Charlemagne in Attila total war yet here the majority accepted something like that and yes, it is awful. Then came the extra DLCs with additional lords that were also overpriced yet people still found my review back them as funny even if at that time i stated the obvious missing features and bugs.Now after so many years we still have (without mods):- random crashes in battles - random crashes in changing turns- awful siege battles, the outer walls are like decorations, the inner towers are like a joke and it is pretty weird since they created Empire total war and they could just place towers manned by missile troops and have extra barricades by the units in order to actually feel that you have ground control- awful battle optimization, create a doomstack of strong missile units and you are good to go even if your enemy has armored knights or infantry since the ai is weird focusing on the lord most of the time.- awful bonuses for the ai in battle map and campaign, i mean if i played against someone that uses cheats then i would just stop playing yet in almost every total war title and here there is no exception, the ai will probably beat you but only because it's cheating, so if you play against a hard ai it will not just outsmart you, it will get the bonuses and beat you, challenging isn't it? I thought that a strategy game is all about finding the most fitting strategy to overcome your opponent- no formations for the troops like shield wall, testudo, schiltron, pike phalanx, fire by rank and so on, and the long requested mix between melee and missile units which will be useful for the starting troops to counter the beasts of this world- no meaningful upgrades for the units, it feels that the experience bonuses are like a joke with no real impact in the battle, same goes for the technology buffs of the units- no visual unit upgrades by the armory like in medieval 2 total war or like in Attila through the technology tree- awful balance between the factions, no counter strategies for certain skills/abilities- very few lord in accordance with the lore of warhammer universe, i can think of almost 40 khorne heroes yet the game has 2, well, we actually know why- poor compatibility with the mods in workshop. sometimes it's the modders fault but most of the times that comes a new patch then all of the mods need to be reworked in order to be playable- Governing systems between races are missing and the one that the empire has it's still not fixed with each electoral faction almost acting on each own without being able to allied with each other..At the end of the day, they just lost a costumer since i will never buy another of their titles if they insist on the same money grabbing practices...",pain write review sinc play total war game sinc rome total war yet go order someon enjoy everyth game offer pay that amaz get itwho enabl get far well think thing get betterwith everi broken releas reward money kept go go without fix bug address balanc faction onth first warhamm total war releas back bug yet fresh instal franchis us exit come came first dlc alarm hype still strongwith releas warhamm total war ad coupl faction new campaign get interest everi titl franchis would expansiondlc core game like age charlemagn attila total war yet major accept someth like ye aw came extra dlc addit lord also overpr yet peopl still found review back funni even time state obviou miss featur bugsnow mani year still without mod random crash battl random crash chang turn aw sieg battl outer wall like decor inner tower like joke pretti weird sinc creat empir total war could place tower man missil troop extra barricad unit order actual feel ground control aw battl optim creat doomstack strong missil unit good go even enemi armor knight infantri sinc ai weird focus lord time aw bonus ai battl map campaign mean play someon use cheat would stop play yet almost everi total war titl except ai probabl beat cheat play hard ai outsmart get bonus beat challeng isnt thought strategi game find fit strategi overcom oppon format troop like shield wall testudo schiltron pike phalanx fire rank long request mix mele missil unit use start troop counter beast world meaning upgrad unit feel experi bonus like joke real impact battl goe technolog buff unit visual unit upgrad armori like mediev total war like attila technolog tree aw balanc faction counter strategi certain skillsabl lord accord lore warhamm univers think almost khorn hero yet game well actual know poor compat mod workshop sometim modder fault time come new patch mod need rework order playabl govern system race miss one empir still fix elector faction almost act without abl alli otherat end day lost costum sinc never buy anoth titl insist money grab practic
"2023 The game isn't perfect, there are areas to improve. However this is almost a new game compared to how it was at the release of total war warhammer 3. Its in a decent state. Generally gameplay, and fun has only improved as post release development has happened. The DLC is expensive. To get the most out of it you at least should own the DLC for the factions/races you enjoy the play of. If it is a game 2 faction in IE it will cost you a bit. I should assume by end of the dev phase of 3 it will be the same with a lot more factions.Be aware of this before going in. Theres no way to test factions as DLC, a try before you buy function, and the price can add up. However the gameplay is fun, it has good visuals, the over world campaign has a lot to do. The AI needs a bit more work, but even that is getting to a good point. The DLC team as well consistently does good work.

"2014 Hey, i am just curious if anyone else does this. Every day when i take a shower, i like to turn the water super hot, hold my nuts in my hand and let the scalding hot water run over them.Lately my balls have been extremely itchy for some reason, so instead of itching them, i burn them with scalding hot water to relieve the itching and it is quite possibly the most amazing sensation i've ever felt in my life. It feels amazing and i'm doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. I just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else. As i've been doing this, the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working.I know it's weird but i'm telling you it feels incredible. I'm not saying other people should try it, but if you've got an itch, perhaps a better alternative is to burn them with scalding hot water.",hey curiou anyon els everi day take shower like turn water super hot hold nut hand let scald hot water run themlat ball extrem itchi reason instead itch burn scald hot water reliev itch quit possibl amaz sensat ive ever felt life feel amaz im less damag skin scratch care hot water hit hand thigh hurt realli bad difficult let scald hot water hit nut noth els ive itch gotten less intens day go treatment seem workingi know weird im tell feel incred im say peopl tri youv got itch perhap better altern burn scald hot water

"Game Review: A Journey Worth Every SecondGood: This game hooked me like no other, and I found myself immersed for five days straight. The combat is exhilarating, the graphics are stunning, and the story is captivating—one of the best I’ve seen in a while. However, it’s not as straightforward as most games. To fully appreciate the narrative, you need some background in Chinese mythology, particularly the classic tale ""Journey to the West."" I had to watch a few YouTube videos to get up to speed, but it was worth it.The boss fights, in particular, are nothing short of spectacular. Each one is unique, challenging, and utterly insane. The best for me was the ERLANGGGGGGGG boss fight. I had to do the same fight for 6 hrs straight. Some times the theme plays in my head when I go sleep.The music also deserves special mention. The soundtrack perfectly complements the action and story, heightening the emotional impact of key scenes. The music team absolutely nailed it, delivering hype and tension exactly when needed.Bad: While the game is nearly flawless, there are some technical issues that can be frustrating. Occasionally, I encountered glitches that required a quick restart to fix. It’s a minor inconvenience, but something I hope gets patched soon.Conclusion: Overall, this game is a masterpiece that’s absolutely worth the price. The storytelling, combat, graphics, and music all come together to create an unforgettable experience. Even with its minor technical hiccups, it’s a solid 10/10 in my book. If you’re a fan of mythology or just looking for a game that will consume your time in the best possible way, this is it.",game review journey worth everi secondgood game hook like found immers five day straight combat exhilar graphic stun stori captivatingon best ive seen howev straightforward game fulli appreci narr need background chines mytholog particularli classic tale journey west watch youtub video get speed worth itth boss fight particular noth short spectacular one uniqu challeng utterli insan best erlangggggggg boss fight fight hr straight time theme play head go sleepth music also deserv special mention soundtrack perfectli complement action stori heighten emot impact key scene music team absolut nail deliv hype tension exactli neededbad game nearli flawless technic issu frustrat occasion encount glitch requir quick restart fix minor inconveni someth hope get patch soonconclus overal game masterpiec that absolut worth price storytel combat graphic music come togeth creat unforgett experi even minor technic hiccup solid book your fan mytholog look game consum time best possibl way

"2022 At the point I refunded this game, it had no mortal empires campaign, and no Workshop support. This is probably the most barebones Total Warhammer release by far; it lacks content, lacks diversity in the content it does have, and suffers from performance issues. These performance issues are due to the very strange choice of CA's to use Denuvo. I wonder which came first: these people having disastrous launches every time they release a game, or people pirating their games at release. It seems to me that they could resolve their piracy woes by just releasing their games when they're finished, rather than ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game's performance with Denuvo.",point refund game mortal empir campaign workshop support probabl barebon total warhamm releas far lack content lack divers content suffer perform issu perform issu due strang choic ca use denuvo wonder came first peopl disastr launch everi time releas game peopl pirat game releas seem could resolv piraci woe releas game theyr finish rather game perform denuvo
this game is a fantastic hack and slash with dramatic visuals. I highly recommend this game to both old 40K fans and new. i only have 2 small compliants. 1 the controls are a little unorthodox in my opinion. not impossible to figure out. just odd ball. but this could be easily rectified in the game menu with the key bindings. 2 there is no ultra wide support which in my opinion is very disappointing for a new game in 2024. but again this can easily be rectified with a future update to the game. other than that its a great game.,game fantast hack slash dramat visual highli recommend game old fan new small compliant control littl unorthodox opinion imposs figur odd ball could easili rectifi game menu key bind ultra wide support opinion disappoint new game easili rectifi futur updat game great game
"2022 Finally, after two years of slogging through painfully poor optimization, lackluster content updates, and inane design decisions, I can finally recommend this game. Sort of. The game still has massive issues. Pathing for units is a bit borked, particularly in siege battles. Sieges themselves, while no longer overbearing, are still not great and are long slogs to get through. There are still many noteworthy bugs. I recently started a skaven campaign, only to realize about 20 turns in that and entire lord option was just missing from the UI, and had to restart my campaign from scratch which somehow fixed the issue. There are massive terrain deformations, ranged units have to do a little dance before they acknowledge a new attack order, and plenty more. But things are in a much better state than 2 years ago, and CA do seem committed to fixing up the game and adding new and better stuff. After some content updates, the Shadow of Change and Thrones of Decay DLCs are a lot more appealing now. It is now a more complete Warhammer Fantasy experience, where the positives have begun to outweigh the negatives significantly. CA still have a lot of work to do, but if you love Warhammer and strategy, you probably won't find a more robust game to get... but you should still probably wait for a sale.",final two year slog pain poor optim lacklust content updat inan design decis final recommend game sort game still massiv issu path unit bit bork particularli sieg battl sieg longer overbear still great long slog get still mani noteworthi bug recent start skaven campaign realiz turn entir lord option miss ui restart campaign scratch somehow fix issu massiv terrain deform rang unit littl danc acknowledg new attack order plenti thing much better state year ago ca seem commit fix game ad new better stuff content updat shadow chang throne decay dlc lot appeal complet warhamm fantasi experi posit begun outweigh neg significantli ca still lot work love warhamm strategi probabl wont find robust game get still probabl wait sale

"2022 The game seemed to be going in a good direction with the past two DLCs, but with the new developments, it's curving away from its positive trajectory quite significantly. The game is still very buggy and the pace of bugfixes being tied to DLCs is far too slow. This latest DLC being short on content and particularly pricey, it feels particularly bad. As such, I am switching back my review to negative, as I don't think it's a good time to get in the game right now. Wait and see, and definitely wait for sales if you are going to get anything.For reference, my old review after the Champions of Chaos DLCWith the release of Immortal Empires and the new narrative campaigns for the champions of chaos, fixes to autoresolve and anti-player bias, the game has recovered from its disastrous launch. Just gotta wait for the workshop to get all the essential WH2 mods transferred and this will be the must have sequel that it should have been at launch.For reference, my old review at launch:As it is now, you will probably have a better time in WH2 than in WH3. At least the mod workshop got activated so modders can fix the game for CA.Early final verdict: If you're pretty much done with WH2 and itching for something new, find it on sale and you'll get your money's worth, if not now then over time. If you're not done with WH2, wait for a bigger sale.Such a weird launch for this hugely anticipated sequel to one of the best game series ever. Everyone had high expectations since Total War: Warhammer 2 has done so well with releases with the recent DLCs. Unfortunately, the WH3 teams dropped the ball in many aspects of the game:- Implementation of the narrative: It is not engaging. You have to wait for rifts, then you ""lose"" your legendary lord to race for souls in a format that is hugely biased for the AI (Tzeentch being the worse, but attrition in Nurgle's realm, or battles in the other two because of major faction auto-resolve bias), then if you finally get through, you get a pretty flavorless reward (why not boons tied to the identity of the souls, CA?!) or, if someone succeeds first, you just wasted your time and get kicked out (except in Tzeetch's realm if you mapped a part of it. The God of Change's realm is surprisingly static so next try will be faster)- Reciprocity of the game mechanics: Many mechanics in the campaign are far more punishing in the hands of the AI than for players. Most glaring of all is the auto-resolver which favors the AI so much you're forced to fight meaningless battles to not get your army (not unit(s), army!) wiped out by a clearly inferior opponent. Waiting 2x load times to fight a boring one-sided battle is not a good experience. It doesn't add to game difficulty either, just tedium. The anti-player bias is also stupidly strong. Then there's the faction stuff: Nurgle plagues aren't very effective for the players as the AI recruit armies from nowhere, barely suffers attrition and rarely relies on replenishment, but devastating against the player who has fewer armies, generally tries to not lose units and normally relies on replenishment. Similarly, the changing of ways is absolutely unfun when yielded by the AI. Spend the next turn not doing anything? Come on... Bombardments being easily dodged by the AI (but not wind/vortex spells??) but devastating for the player who can't keep an eye on everything. The list goes on.- Building design and balance. Buildings that are useless, other far more useful. Overall, the selection is bloated and building upgrades are often not worth it. (Ex.: Khislev markets: 4000 gold for a 50 gold income increase? That'll take 80 turns before it's useful. I probably can do something better with that gold right now, that will benefit me much sooner).- Tech tree design and balance. Some techs and tech trees are far superior to others. There is a big difference between choices because it's all good, and because it's all meaningless. Both are present for different factions.- Quality: SO many bugs and problems. Whack-a-tower is not a fun game to play in the already overly common minor settlement battles. Abilities not working. The *awesome voice* docking areas being a trap that nerf your archers. and more. This looks rushed.The game does certain things well though (faction identity, graphics), and it is still a decent game. But it's barely now in the stage it should have launched in and still worse than the current state of its predecessor. Overall, it seems like CA spent a lot of time working on engine stuff and graphics, but very little on making sure the game is actually fun to play. Works ok, looks good, release!

"i wish steam had an in-between option for reviews, because while the gameplay is fun, i don't think it's worth the price with the current level of content. there's a fairly short (6 mission) campaign, 6 operations missions which play out alongside the main campaign, and a barebones PVP mode which is okay. The combat is good but can be a bit janky, especially the melee combat. the control scheme isn't great for mouse & keyboard and was obviously designed with console controllers in mind. I had a few weird bugs, including character/weapon/enemy models becoming invisible & connection issues trying to play operations with a friend, but i appreciate it's still very early days and these will likely be fixed. i'll almost definitely come back to this game in future if/when they add more content, but currently it's far too expensive for what you get.",wish steam inbetween option review gameplay fun dont think worth price current level content there fairli short mission campaign oper mission play alongsid main campaign barebon pvp mode okay combat good bit janki especi mele combat control scheme isnt great mous keyboard obvious design consol control mind weird bug includ characterweaponenemi model becom invis connect issu tri play oper friend appreci still earli day like fix ill almost definit come back game futur ifwhen add content current far expens get

"It feels like I'm doing chores then the developers come into the room and throw paint on the walls and say, ""We've reset the map so it can feel fresh.""GraphicsYup, good graphics. The scenery is beautiful.StoryThe underlying scenario is good enough that it hurts so much that the story is absolute dog poop. There are literally only two characters in the game (everyone else acts like a mannequin).The first character is a woman named Mitsuko dressed in all white who is heavily selling a combination of damsel in distress, amnesiac, and demure. Except this doesn't work at all! She's a mary-sue who has incredible psychic powers; is never once actually in any real danger; and can cross dimensions at will.Some gross creative director leaned over the modeler's shoulder and told them, ""Make her look like she's 18 then make her shirt just every so slightly transparent."" It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ creepy as hell.Mitsuko is obviously supposed to make the player want to protect her, but she's so aggravating. The player is never given any reason at all to care about this person, but the story keeps trotting along with the main character expressing ever more concern.I am trying to express just how badly this story is written. It's so divorced from the reality of events around you. The stakes are never there. Like the awful Star Wars prequels: I keep getting told by the narrative what my character feels and never shown any reason to back it up. I completely tuned out after a while. It's a slog to get through the story sections. I cannot overstate just how uninteresting the story for this game is.The second character is your robot bird thing that's always around you. The voice actor did a good job. It's doing the amnesiac thing, too, which was super annoying.Meat was attempted to be given to the story by adding groups like Rosetta, Mayfly, and Vultures. They're talked about but are completely indistinct from each other. Every single group member simply stands around and shoots you when you get close. Look, this guy is wearing a torn jacket and is behaving exactly like every other NPC. Incredible environmental story telling!Don't forgive bad stories. Bad stories mean that the developers thought so little about your intelligence that they assumed they could shovel nonsense and tropes at you and you'd still spend money because they have women in tight clothes and spent almost their entire budget on lots of special effects.EngagementThe core gameplay loop is to run around collecting things and shooting enemies so you can craft better gear and survive the next area. It's generally enjoyable There are two main types of areas. A boss arena and an overworld.Collecting weapons is done by receiving a random drop (rare) or by crafting the weapon. Crafting and upgrading weapons requires blue prints and the rarer blueprints are the entry point for taking real world money from you. There is a punishing durability aspect to each weapon that further encourages you to spend more time and money on getting more weapons or gathering materials to repair your weapons so you can ... keep gathering materials.All the things!I am impressed at how many distinct features and interfaces are shoved into this game! There are 3 rewards screens. Three. There is so much here that I was still discovering new menus and interactions months into playing. It doesn't need to be this complex. Does complexity equal fun? Nope.OverallThis is a product that spent a lot of money on graphic design while skimping on the things that would make players feel good about playing.Even given all that I've written, I'd still enjoy the game while playing with friends except that the world gets reset every six weeks so what's the point?",feel like im chore develop come room throw paint wall say weve reset map feel freshgraphicsyup good graphic sceneri beautifulstoryth underli scenario good enough hurt much stori absolut dog poop liter two charact game everyon els act like mannequinth first charact woman name mitsuko dress white heavili sell combin damsel distress amnesiac demur except doesnt work she marysu incred psychic power never actual real danger cross dimens willsom gross creativ director lean model shoulder told make look like she make shirt everi slightli transpar creepi hellmitsuko obvious suppos make player want protect she aggrav player never given reason care person stori keep trot along main charact express ever concerni tri express badli stori written divorc realiti event around stake never like aw star war prequel keep get told narr charact feel never shown reason back complet tune slog get stori section overst uninterest stori game isth second charact robot bird thing that alway around voic actor good job amnesiac thing super annoyingmeat attempt given stori ad group like rosetta mayfli vultur theyr talk complet indistinct everi singl group member simpli stand around shoot get close look guy wear torn jacket behav exactli like everi npc incred environment stori tellingdont forgiv bad stori bad stori mean develop thought littl intellig assum could shovel nonsens trope youd still spend money women tight cloth spent almost entir budget lot special effectsengagementth core gameplay loop run around collect thing shoot enemi craft better gear surviv next area gener enjoy two main type area boss arena overworldcollect weapon done receiv random drop rare craft weapon craft upgrad weapon requir blue print rarer blueprint entri point take real world money punish durabl aspect weapon encourag spend time money get weapon gather materi repair weapon keep gather materialsal thingsi impress mani distinct featur interfac shove game reward screen three much still discov new menu interact month play doesnt need complex complex equal fun nopeoverallthi product spent lot money graphic design skimp thing would make player feel good playingeven given ive written id still enjoy game play friend except world get reset everi six week what point

"2022 Good entry to the souls like games. 8/10 game. Feels like it is Dark souls 3 the sequel. FromSoftware didnt really take too many risks with innovation aside from a free roam map and a new skill system for your weapons this plays exactly like other souls like games. They have learned from some mistakes in their other games but some frustrating issues are still present from other games. The hitboxes in this entry are finally good, you can duck under swings from a sword, jump over attacks its honestly pretty cool but then you still have the same issues that were present in previous games such as enemies being able to hit through walls, AOE projectiles will hit you through floors etc. Performance has also been quite inconsistent. They are still using their really poorly designed (at least imo) summon system. For some bosses if you wish to summon a player but theres not many players currently on that boss (or at least want to be summoned for the boss) then you will see only a small handful of summon signs and by the time you have interacted with them someone else has summoned the player so you missed them. It happens constantly in areas with few summon signs and it is essentially a race to the sign. Summoning your friends has now been made ""easier"" with a password mechanic so only you and your friend can see eachothers summon signs which is fine but if I want me friend to help me with a boss that they have not discovered yet I have to wait for them to get to the area and clear it and get to my location before I can summon. Its just time wasting and it would be so much handier if they could for example just join me through steam to fight the boss and they go back to their own game instead of wasting 30 minutes of both our time. Its an issue iv had with all the souls games I just think the summon mechanic is really bad.Invasions have also been changed in this game to the point where I honestly thought they just got rid of invasions. Instead they have been changed. You can now only be invaded if you are exploring with a coop partner or if you happen to have found and used a specific item that allows players to invade your solo world (why even call it Invasion if you allowing it? Its not really an invasion if you have a choice to be invaded). Most players (or at least among my friend group) do not summon for simple exploration but to fight bosses and seeing as you cannot be invaded mid boss fight we have essentially seen no invasions.The world and dungeons are once again beautifully crafted and if you loved the older games big dungeon design you will feel right at home. The game does suffer however from a few smaller dungeons/caves that are in my opinion poorly designed. You will notice that these smaller dungeons/caves are essentially copy and paste jobs of one another with just a different layout. Some of them are even the exact same layout. There are a few really fun ones that have the most different layouts or require you to do some thinking on how to progress but for the most part the dungeons are quick, easy, and very similar to one another.Enemy and boss designs are once again amazing looking however I still do not understand why they put Margit as one of the first bosses as he is far harder than even some late game bosses.The Horse is fine. It is mostly used for traversal. Mounted combat on horseback is very basic and aside from using the horse to help with fighting the games many Dragons (mostly using it to dodge firebreath attacks when the Dragon flies) it is pretty boring to fight whilst mounted.Overall it is probably one of the best of FromSoftwares games. Is it a masterpiece? No. The devs have improved on nearly every aspect of the series but have taken few risks in innovation and actually doing anything new. I think FromSoftware can do better as this just feels like a souls game but with an open world.",good entri soul like game game feel like dark soul sequel fromsoftwar didnt realli take mani risk innov asid free roam map new skill system weapon play exactli like soul like game learn mistak game frustrat issu still present game hitbox entri final good duck swing sword jump attack honestli pretti cool still issu present previou game enemi abl hit wall aoe projectil hit floor etc perform also quit inconsist still use realli poorli design least imo summon system boss wish summon player there mani player current boss least want summon boss see small hand summon sign time interact someon els summon player miss happen constantli area summon sign essenti race sign summon friend made easier password mechan friend see eachoth summon sign fine want friend help boss discov yet wait get area clear get locat summon time wast would much handier could exampl join steam fight boss go back game instead wast minut time issu iv soul game think summon mechan realli badinvas also chang game point honestli thought got rid invas instead chang invad explor coop partner happen found use specif item allow player invad solo world even call invas allow realli invas choic invad player least among friend group summon simpl explor fight boss see invad mid boss fight essenti seen invasionsth world dungeon beauti craft love older game big dungeon design feel right home game suffer howev smaller dungeonscav opinion poorli design notic smaller dungeonscav essenti copi past job one anoth differ layout even exact layout realli fun one differ layout requir think progress part dungeon quick easi similar one anotherenemi boss design amaz look howev still understand put margit one first boss far harder even late game bossesth hors fine mostli use travers mount combat horseback basic asid use hors help fight game mani dragon mostli use dodg firebreath attack dragon fli pretti bore fight whilst mountedoveral probabl one best fromsoftwar game masterpiec dev improv nearli everi aspect seri taken risk innov actual anyth new think fromsoftwar better feel like soul game open world

"Black Myth Wukong Review I played 9 hours but 4 were offline so I think it will say I played 5 hours, I didn't beat the game, yet I still made this comprehensive review to explain the core aspects of the game and it's quality. This review uses my own experience and those of my friends who got ahead in the game. I am 30 years old, and I don't enjoy souls likes anymore in the long term. Still, I did my review objectively and I think you might find it useful. Cheers!~Black Myth Wukong is a soul-like game that adds some interesting elements to the genre by incorporating new ideas into its gameplay through the legendary tale of Sun Wukong. Players can transform into bosses they defeated before (with some limitations), and Wukong's tricks are plenty. They can range from transforming into rock to making multiple clones of themselves or freezing foes in place, unable to move or fight back.The player will explore the tale of the legendary monkey king while fighting challenging bosses and recovering the artifacts of Wukong. The game starts easy but rapidly reaches difficulty levels of your most popular soul games, requiring skill, strategy, and wits to defeat fearsome foes. What Makes It Worth Playing?If there is something people hear about this game, it is two things: transforming into bosses and ray tracing. The ray tracing of the game looks beautiful, as reflections and environments look superb on the screen. The requirements are quite bulky, as I used an RTX 4070 Super and could either go 2k with Ray Tracing at medium with settings on very high for 70-90 FPS or 4k with no ray tracing at the same frame rate. Explore the story of Sun Wukong in a blockbuster fashion! A Screenshot of Black Myth: Wukong By: Nirhildija The story is surprisingly very good and interesting, voice actors do well in their assigned roles, and the opening of the game is similar to a blockbuster movie. The tale deals with wanting to be free, which Wukong wants, but the Celestial Court won't let him be. In addition, the court enjoys mocking him and other beast-like creatures, angering him as he rebels to prove his might. The difficulty is another aspect that might attract players looking to establish themselves and face off against challenging foes in exciting and nerve-wracking gameplay.Core GameplayThe game's core combat focuses on options and the availability of resources. The player has multiple avenues for choosing how to fight enemies, such as spirits that they can summon and take their form to unleash special attacks, becoming bosses, using skills such as invisibility, or using their pole to get above the enemy and avoid attacks. Having so many assets to use on foes and see what works best against certain enemies is incredibly fun and rewarding. Fight fearsome foes that will make your blood burn hot! A Screenshot of Black Myth: Wukong By: Nirhildija The premise is that the game is a boss rush; you go to a place, explore it, beat the boss, and move on. If you defeat bosses effortlessly, you run into a lot of bosses on the norm, and each combat is intriguing and unique. Battle monks that summon the fallen, rat siblings in a 1vs2, giant tigers that bathe in the blood of their foes with big swords, etc. The game action is fast, so you have to act quickly before enemies resume the onslaught of attacks. There is no co-op for this game (so those that like souls games with co-op experiences, be warned, it is only going to be you!), and there is no punishment for dying in-game, so you are stress-free and don't have to pick up your ""souls"" or currencies of other types.My ExperienceI enjoyed my time in the game, as brief as it was (I am getting old to be playing this hardcore game, I swear, haha~). I didn't find the stances attractive, as the default stance worked better for me than the other two. The tricks of Wukong are fun to use, and in boss fights, you need to use all of your arsenals intelligently to emerge victorious on the challenging boss fights, which is a great gameplay design. Enemies often have their particular bag of tricks they will use on the player. Defeat enemies and take their form to use to your advantage! A Screenshot of Black Myth: Wukong By: Nirhildija I used many points in the foundation, mainly HP and stamina. I also used some points in transformations and the immobility spell, as they are instrumental. The gameplay is like a combination of souls, like in action games. It is hard, but you are as powerful as your foes, making the soul-like experience less stressful and difficult. The game's presentation is fantastic; enemies react to your boss's transformations, and the dialogue in fights is on par with the rest of the game. Long Term Appeal A game playthrough will last between 40-60 hours, depending on your skill, and you can always replay the game after beating it to challenge even stronger foes. I am getting burned out of the genre. Go there, fight a powerful enemy, get destroyed, do it again until you succeed, and repeat for another 40 hours. I may have been playing too much Elden Ring, but I don't enjoy Souls games as much as I did before.Back to the review, if you like challenges meant to block your progression and prove your skills, this game is impressive. It excels at all its facets and is incredible to experience. If you prefer to avoid difficulty, be wary. It is a marathon to get to the end of this title, as the mountain is rather tall and complex to climb. Price Point AnalysisIt is an easy buy for its asking price. If your computer can run it, you are guaranteed to have a good time with this game.ConclusionIn a genre so cluttered with so many games that it feels oversaturated, Black Myth Wukong succeeds in adding a new spice to the genre by revolutionizing the gameplay and rewards of its core experience. It is a must-play for all souls, like fans who enjoy this title, and an invitation to try it out for those who feel braver and confident in their skills. This game's graphics, music, story, gameplay, and design are superb and worth all the praise it's been getting.10/10 MASTERPIECE:) If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator!

"2022 There's a lot of new and good things they tried which is a net good. However as most reviews point out, the game is unfinished and non-functional at times. Ranged units stand around even when their default state is fire at will. If there's a large corpse on the battlefield, units struggle to pathfind around it to the point of them being stuck in a walking loop. Campaign gets stuck if you so much as click at the wrong time. Prologue / tutorial as good with the amount of voice acting and cutscenes - main campaign feels bare-boned in comparison. Summed up, people are frustrated that CA ""broke"" stuff that was already working fine in TWW2 in trying to remake the wheel. Here's to hoping they fix it soon but yeah, can not recommend it at in its current state.",there lot new good thing tri net good howev review point game unfinish nonfunct time rang unit stand around even default state fire there larg corps battlefield unit struggl pathfind around point stuck walk loop campaign get stuck much click wrong time prologu tutori good amount voic act cutscen main campaign feel barebon comparison sum peopl frustrat ca broke stuff alreadi work fine tri remak wheel here hope fix soon yeah recommend current state

"Lets talk about their privacy policy:https://protocol.unisdk.easebar.com/release/latest_v475.html Over-collection of Personal Information and security risks: The policy collects a wide range of personal data, including sensitive information like government-issued IDs, which is typically excessive unless specifically required by law or for a legitimate purpose. Collecting and storing extensive personal and sensitive information like government IDs, credit card details, social media data, and communication history poses significant security and privacy risks. They also list numerous third-party recipients of personal information without specifying how these parties will handle the data.Lack of Transparency and Purpose Limitation: It's unclear why such extensive details are needed for ""correction of personal information."" Transparency about data collection purposes is crucial for users to understand why their data is being collected. There's also little to no mention of user consent or control over their data. GDPR and similar regulations require clear consent mechanisms and user rights, such as the right to access, correct, and delete personal data. While it mentions consent in some contexts (e.g., marketing), it's unclear how users can exercise control over their data, such as accessing or deleting it. GDPR and similar regulations require clear mechanisms for users to manage their data. The policy also doesn't specify how long different types of data will be retained, which is essential for users to understand their data lifecycle and rights regarding data deletion.Legal Basis and Justification: Although the policy mentions legal bases for processing personal data (e.g., legitimate interests), it does not elaborate on how these bases apply to specific data processing activities, which is crucial for compliance and user understanding.TLDR; this privacy policy is problematic because it lacks clarity, transparency, and appears to over-collect personal information without sufficient justification or safeguards for user privacy. regularly, privacy policies should prioritize user consent, data security, limited data collection, and clear communication of data usage purposes.Personal peeve: You also cant claim closed beta rewards on steam unless you download their NetEase spyware launcher.

"2022 How we can come from the brilliance of TWW2 to this is baffling. Wait for (Im)Mortal Empire, and a remake of siege battles. UPDATE after a couple of days and some hours of gameplay: So many bugs, things that doesn't gets added/calculated, missing game mechanics, stupidly created maps that the AI cannot navigate, general bad movement meaning you have to micro manage all units all the time, etc. UPDATE 04/09/22: Immortal Empire Beta is released. The game is still not good, but at least it's not as bad as it was at release. Play TWW2 if you want a good game. 3.5/10 (formerly 3.5). IM is FULL of bugs, missing features and crap that just doesn't work. Rituals that doesn't work or cannot be activated, ambush zones that doesn't work, idiotic choices in the max 20 units in a city defense, some maps are ridiculous badly programmed, city sieges are basically just a waste of time (it's not difficult at all but it will steal hours of your life). Oh, and victory achievements doesn't work. Don't wait 6 more months. Just bypass the game. It's not worth it. Why CA? Why did you have to ♥♥♥♥ up this game and not fix it?EDIT: After patch 4.0 they still haven't fixed achievements unless you do a domination victory on IE. Latest DLC price is €25. And there are still a ♥♥♥♥ load of bugs. This game is, unfortunately, dead.EDIT after patch 5.2.2: So many, many bugs. Every time the dev's fix something, something else stops working. I have almost 1500 hours in this so I definitely got my moneys worth no matter how many times I forgot to turn the game off. But I still cannot recommend the game.

"I recently had the pleasure of diving into ""Black Myth: Wukong,"" and I must say, it stands out as a breath of fresh air in the souls-like genre. While many games in this space are known for their punishing difficulty, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" offers a more casual experience that still retains thrilling combat and exploration.The gameplay feels fluid and accessible, allowing me to fully enjoy the stunning visuals and intricate world design without being stuck in a loop of frustration. The combat mechanics are engaging, with a variety of moves and combos that make each encounter feel unique. What truly sets ""Black Myth: Wukong"" apart is its captivating storytelling and rich cultural references, drawing from the classic tale of the Monkey King. The game beautifully integrates myth with action, resulting in an experience that’s both entertaining and thought-provoking.Overall, if you’re a fan of souls-like games but prefer a more casual approach, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a must-play. The blend of accessibility and depth makes it not just a worthy competitor, but in my opinion, an even better experience than other souls games.

Yes, yes it does, but right now the BIGGEST problem I have with it, is that on occasion the game crashes if I tab out, yea that is annoying, but of all the things that could have gone wrong, that is a very minor problem for me. I see a' lot of people complaining about the multiplayer and or the performance, but me and my friends have no issues with that at all.

"For a free game, I'm actually very impressed.Could definitely use a few tweaks, but overall I'm enjoying so far.Cons:The patch screen after downloading and installing is a bit of a pain. When I first launched I had to wait an hour to play. A few days later there was another unexpected patch after loading up the game and I had to wait again. It would be nice to have updates/patches just go through steam so I know when the game is actually playable.Enemy difficulty could use some adjustments. The bosses can get real tricky, but the normal deviants that you encounter, even the bigger versions of them are a piece of cake. Far too easy and the melee animation can take a bit too long for low health deviants I don't feel like wasting ammo on. I find the story a bit boring, I skip through a lot of the dialogue because it's too much reading for me (adhd brain, so grain of salt) Pros:The map is huge and there's a lot to explore and loot. Lots of side quests and boss battles. As a builder I'm fairly happy with the building system and love that I can easily move structures up and down.

"2022 This title, including its two predecessors, is my all-time favorite game. I'm certain that it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, as I don't think I'll ever be as invested or hyped for a game again.Let me provide a little backstory. Back in 2004-2006, my cousin and I spent all our time and money in a local paint store that sold Warhammer. We would arrive in the morning and stay until our moms would come take us home for dinner. I don't think the store owners liked us much, probably because we were broke kids who spent hours just staring at the box art, imagining epic battles. In 2009-2010, I got my first Total War game, Empire Total War. It didn't take me long to realize that Total War and Warhammer were a perfect match.Around 2013, I saw a blog post on the Total War forum or CA webpage (I can't remember exactly where) that said CA had obtained the rights to make a game for a GW IP. I was beyond excited. Then, in 2015, the first trailer dropped, and since then, I've easily spent over 300 hours listening to lore videos and prediction videos. Every single DLC announcement feels like Christmas to me. I think I've spent more time imagining what will come next for the title than actually playing the game. Without overreacting, I can say that I've thought about this game at least once every day since the first announcement.Another thing I appreciate about this game is the community. It's full of fans who are just as excited as I am, and what's unique about this community is that everyone seems really pro-DLC. People are begging CA to release more DLC and new content more often, which is a rare sight in a lot of gaming communities. But it's for good reason that people praise DLC for this game. I've bought every game and every single DLC without regrets, and I'll continue to support them until it's over. Everything they deliver is worth it in my opinion, and the game is a dream come true for Warhammer Fantasy tabletop players.If you're a fan of Warhammer fantasy and video games, Total War: Warhammer is a must-have. I feel sorry for the 40k community because there is no 40k game that can compete with this.

"2022 Just like any other Souls game in the series, there is something so lovingly hated about the best and worst parts of this game. Your cookie cutter favorites will never live up to the hype of this title. A mash up of all the desired pieces of gaming history has created a hodgepodge of pure bliss. Love or hate the title, it's a game that has truly become the foundation of ""Souls-like"" titles. Never has there been such an accessible title in the Souls franchise that many can enjoy to their heart's conten--- YOU DIED --- as I was saying, this game is great. Let's start with the mechanics: thoroughly improved over some of the older classics. Crafting? Got it. Death? Pffft, it wouldn't be a Souls game if your monitor didn't have the words YOU DIED burned into your screen. Ashes of War is something relatively new to the franchise. Customize your favorite weapons to better suit your build. Scale your weapons to fit your attributes, and voila: you have a recipe for pure chaos. They have expanded on some of the earlier concepts, turning this title into the mega-ultra-super --redacted-- version of what a Souls game could have been 15 years ago. It truly hits home in so many aspects that I was engulfed by it's Flamed Frenzy for 200+ hours before I finished the game. In fact, the game is so accessible that people who would generally hate titles like this, or maybe even hated Souls games a decade ago, are now playing this game and realizing, ""Hey, this game is HARD AS ♥♥♥♥. But WOW, I killed that boss after 15 tries and it FELT SO GOOD"". It's Euphoria to say the least. The open world has really garnished a new set of players that, to be honest, would never play a Souls game. Now that there is an enormous player base, there is more love to share when--- YOU DIED ---- well, I think you get the picture.Masochism, sadism, religion, destruction, it all behests the title of Elden Ring.But honestly, do YOU have the balls to become the Elden--- YOU DIED --- ....um, ya.

"Space Marine 2 is a long-awaited, much-hoped-for sequel to the first Space Marine game. You play as <REDACTED> (jk it's freaking Titus like that wasn't obvious enough) who starts off using Primaris-styled equipment as a regular first-born marine. Hmm. Can't say that's particularly lore accurate, but whatever, it's Titus so that's cool. Unfortunately he's no Mark Strong this time, can't blame him after everything that happened. Be aware. I tried playing the campaign missions on Angel of Death difficulty. This will color my breakdown below.The 'nids are, as expected, annoying ass space bugs that swarm you faster than skaven do at a Warpstone rave party, and they're fairly dangerous. In fact, each of them individually might not seem like a problem but start throwing in 3 or so hormagaunts and you'll start having more stab wounds than a mugging victim in London. The termagaunts, those little annoying freaking shooty bugs, appear to not wield regular fleshborers, since the damn things flash green like miniature rapid-fire venom cannons. If you don't know what a venom cannon is, I'll explain it further down below in the Warrior section.All of these swarm mechanics overwhelming you through sheer numbers is really pronounced. I started having to take engagements carefully and seriously right from the get-go. You can't regenerate any health from simple executions this time either, you need to have taken damage recently (a la Bloodborne) and this makes Titus not only feel like tissue paper, but unable to recover easily. You need to use the medical stims and those are far and few in between, so they definitely took the 'its too easy' critique about the first game too much to heart. Titus will find these enemies dangerous and annoying in equal measure as a result, so don't go thinking you can charge into the jaws of hell and not get tarpitted harder than Abbadon facing a 50 block of guardsmen backed up by a Commissar Lord. They are just as fearless as said guardsmen and unlike Abbadon, Titus can't ♥♥♥♥ out like 10 attacks in a single round of combat, so you better hope you're good at parrying. Note that while parrying or dodging or attacking, you are more or less animation locked. You can't cancel easily, and this honestly makes you feel a lot more sluggish than Captain Titus, who is now obviously the best version of Titus there was. This means you have to thin their numbers at range, hopefully reducing the 'gaunt variants down to less than 3 by the time the Warrior rushes you down.Let's talk about Warriors. Warriors are the big 'nids that have that annoying ass whip, that annoying ass paired boneswords, that really annoying ass devourer, or that annoying ass venom cannon (that long snout thing).The Whip is not too bad in a 1 on 1, just make sure to either stay clear of it while wiping out the small forms or...dunno, charge in and beat it to death before it can get really annoying. When it does that lash combo attack, it's very hard to parry so you're better off just trying to keep your distance and shooting it down.The twin boneswords is just tanky. That's it.The devourer is basically a rapid-fire fleshborer, and the Warrior who uses it is the most irritating PoS you will ever encounter. It will constantly skate away to the backline to pepper you with clusters of projectiles and it adds up a lot of damage very fast. Snipe this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as soon as possible. If you try to close in melee, it will sometimes unload every shot into you at point-blank range and you can die from this.The last one, the venom cannon wielder, is the sniper variant. A venom cannon is like a biological railgun except instead of shooting a metal projectile it shoots this venomous acidic crystal that is superheated by the electrical discharge (yes, this is how it works in lore) and is launched at high speed to penetrate vehicles...or something. It didn't really work against real vehicles, but it definitely works against MEQ (shorthand for 'marine equivalent') like Titus. You will get a warning in the form of a sickly green laser tracking you and you can dodge the shot quite easily with good timing. The real problem is when one of them shows up and you are fighting a swarm or two and their Warrior melee cousins all at the same time, which is when things get nasty. Even then, its particular attacks are not hard to avoid, so either trust in your mobility or kill them off first, your choice.There's more bug variants and their stupid tactics but I'm tired of talking about bugs so let's talk about weapons.Gunplay and melee aren't mutually exclusive, it retains the general fluidity of the first game and you can swap between the two styles of combat very fast. Pistols are actually useful, they take their own slot and can help offset some disadvantages of your primary, while also serving as a way to perform kill shots on parried enemies.Bolters. Holy Emperor the bolters. There are so many bolter variants, and some of them being very cross purposes with their actual function to the point it makes you wonder who needs this many variants. They are all lifted from the Primaris arsenal, and you get the whole freaking line of them (except Assault Bolters). Bolt carbines, heavy bolt pistols, auto bolt rifles, you name it they have it. In fact, I would argue that there are simply too many bolters. In the first game most of the same roles were replicated by unique weapons, such as the plasma gun, the lascannon, the vengeance launcher, and so on. Now you get...bolters.Some of them are effective and some are not, but all of them are only average on Angel of Death difficulty so I didn't really find them to be that unique. What stood out were the non-bolter weapons, the Plasma Incinerator and the Melta Rifle.The Plasma Incinerator is like a cross between the regular plasma gun and a very small plasma cannon, and it performs well enough in that role. It's plasma and it hurts.The Melta Rifle is basically just like the melta gun from the first game. Tight AOE cone that does more damage the closer to the center of the aiming circle you get, huge shotgun blast that can melt anything.There's some other stuff like the Las Fusil, which is basically just a lascannon if they scaled it down and in-game it's basically a Charge Rifle from Titanfall. It's still a good weapon, but they clearly learned their lesson from the first game where the lascannon's instant shot could utterly destroy an unfortunate enemy's face at close range.Melee weapons unfortunately all feel a little samey. The chainsword is effective but it only swings in tight arcs and relies on a charge attack combo to stun enemies, which is extremely awkward compared to the first game where your stun/charge attack was another key altogether. This means it is very easy to start a chainsword combo then get hit for your trouble because you have no way of interrupting your enemy.The power sword is a little more forgiving as it has actual stances that emphasize AOE or single target combat. It still has the issue of not being able to stagger big creatures reliably, or having a charge attack combo that matters, but it is reliable enough with its large sweeping attacks to actually outperform the chainsword on a regular basis.The thunder hammer took a big hit from last game. It is just as sluggish and slow despite Titus' better augmentations, but is weaker. You can put a lot of hurt on enemies, but you have too many gaps open that leave you unable to defend yourself properly. Compare that to the first game, where the hammer's instant-kill damage and reliable stun combo can AOE wipe out hordes of daemons or whatever. It's very weak in this game.The power fist staggers most enemies. Good enough.So Is game gud? yes. Get. Play.

"It's a good game sir. Only real issues I have with it are that Tyranids just can't compete with the Space Marine 1 Orks, and that single player almost feels like an afterthought when you look at all of the multiplayer only stuff like classes, perk systems, better weapon selections, armor customization. There are certain sections while playing the highest difficulty solo in campaign that I felt were definitely designed around having multiple players and the AI just wasn't cutting it so I had to get creative on just surviving. Not a gigantic issue and I'm sure playing the highest difficulty wasn't helping me.Something I do want to mention is that the story is not as interesting as it could have been. Space Marine 1 had an ending that could have a much more interesting followup. Instead a more interesting short story was put in White Dwarf to kind of get Titus to Space Marine 2s starting point, and Boltgun was created to cover the other half of the story stuff they needed to put in place.Otherwise the game is generally an improvement over 1.",good game sir real issu tyranid cant compet space marin ork singl player almost feel like afterthought look multiplay stuff like class perk system better weapon select armor custom certain section play highest difficulti solo campaign felt definit design around multipl player ai wasnt cut get creativ surviv gigant issu im sure play highest difficulti wasnt help mesometh want mention stori interest could space marin end could much interest followup instead interest short stori put white dwarf kind get titu space marin start point boltgun creat cover half stori stuff need put placeotherwis game gener improv

"2022 My advice at this point is to wait for the immortal empires release to see if this is worth playing.Pros-Relatively fun units, lords and faction mechanics.-The graphics are about what you would expect from a sequelCons-The campaign just fails on so many levels. 1) The actual campaign mechanics don't feel rewarding and are oftentimes more punishing as you progress. Realm of Chaos is just a torturous bore that doesn't really offer any reward and particularly in Tzeentch's realm its a crap shoot of racing the enemy AI and hoping you randomly choose the correct portal path. 2) Random warp portals. This is just monumentally frustrating and with limited armies can often lead to positions of you just hoping you've lucked out in having the appropriate forces in the right position if the AI goes for any kind of jankiness. Expect to waste an army or several dedicated to sitting in your important economic/production territories. This is particularly necessary if the AI decides to build up a few stacks before bumrushing a city.- City battles. The AI does not interact well with cities offense or defense. Units defending points that you aren't attacking or wandering units back and forth at random between points. -The AI in general is just... bad. Easily abuseable at all difficulties on the battle map and there are many times you will have to abuse it because the AI cheat stats at higher difficulties makes trying to play with basic tactics moot. i.e. spears/anti-large infantry don't really do anything to units they supposedly counter. Melee infantry is basically useless in the face of more ranged units. Regular cavalry units are generally not good. So basically the strat tends to wind down to hide the army exposing a single fast moving unit usually a lord and break the AI by luring out a unit at a time to pound into the dust via mass range spam/magic. (khorne has some leeway with the free armies they can spam out for disposable melee but yeah ultimately not a good time)-The campaign AI is just bad with the cheats to compete with the player. Also anti-player bias is hilarious watching the AI ignore 6 full stacks of another AI they are at war with to come barreling down at you the player's out of the way undefended minor settlement while they get utterly ransacked and it doesn't mean anything because the AI isn't playing under any of the constraints that the player has to deal with on the campaign map beyond movement.",advic point wait immort empir releas see worth playingprosrel fun unit lord faction mechanicsth graphic would expect sequelconsth campaign fail mani level actual campaign mechan dont feel reward oftentim punish progress realm chao tortur bore doesnt realli offer reward particularli tzeentch realm crap shoot race enemi ai hope randomli choos correct portal path random warp portal monument frustrat limit armi often lead posit hope youv luck appropri forc right posit ai goe kind janki expect wast armi sever dedic sit import economicproduct territori particularli necessari ai decid build stack bumrush citi citi battl ai interact well citi offens defens unit defend point arent attack wander unit back forth random point ai gener bad easili abus difficulti battl map mani time abus ai cheat stat higher difficulti make tri play basic tactic moot ie spearsantilarg infantri dont realli anyth unit supposedli counter mele infantri basic useless face rang unit regular cavalri unit gener good basic strat tend wind hide armi expos singl fast move unit usual lord break ai lure unit time pound dust via mass rang spammag khorn leeway free armi spam dispos mele yeah ultim good timeth campaign ai bad cheat compet player also antiplay bia hilari watch ai ignor full stack anoth ai war come barrel player way undefend minor settlement get utterli ransack doesnt mean anyth ai isnt play constraint player deal campaign map beyond movement

"I know I going to be on the unpopular side here, but I just want anyone thinking of buying the game to get the chance to see a review that tells it like it is.I have never played a 40k game before, so without any passion or connection to the universe, I only can judge this game off of what it provides to me. This game is... not horrible, but it certainly isn't great either.The campaign is short. Very short by today's standards. Like 6 hours, short. I finished in one sitting after work. Now, this isn't horrible, but it since the campaign is arguably the best part of the game, it being that short doesn't really bode well. Fun combat, great visuals, and an entertaining story... that you'll be done with at the end of the day. Multiplayer is, well, not as great. The operations are interesting at best, monotonous at worst. You essentially get to play through a co-op mission of the campaign as the ""B-team"" that you would always order to go do stuff. It provides an interesting and new perspective, but is certainly nothing great. The ""endless"" war multiplayer, I.E the PvP, is fun for about, well, 2 days. Afterwards you realize you only have 3 game modes on 3 maps. It gets repetitive instantly. Now I know what you're gonna say, ""oh but there will be updates, and look at the roadmap!"".

"2013 Initially I was very hesitant about this game; it seemed very risky to make so many fundamental changes to a formula that was barely changed through Counter-Strike: Source and Condition Zero. However, seeing how much Valve has listened and continues to listen the community, and how quickly they make changes in both the short and long term, it has completely restored my faith in the game. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is incredibly fun and feature-rich, with plenty to do for both casual and competitive players. On top of this, there is also plenty of ways to promote and support eSports, which is a much-needed and fundamental step in reinvigorating Counter-Strike in the competitive gaming scene. However, the most important thing with this game is that the community is incredibly nice and friendly - and with a game as difficult and intense as Counter-Strike, it's extremely welcoming.

"2022 Sieges and battles: Sieges are full of choke points, little open space. Any units can scale the walls, they aren't equippable and the units don’t have to drag the ladders to the walls. Battles more generally are more simple than other Total War titles. Feels like they took some of the challenge out of the game, in order to make it appeal to a wider audience. Graphics: This is the best aspect in my opinion, the game looks gorgeous. Map(s): With the immortal empires patch you get the entire world, which is great.Lore: I feel the game could tell the story a bit more, in Three Kingdoms, there are cut-scenes when you reach certain goals, you get an idea and feel for the events around you. Heroes: Sometimes the heroes can get a bit jarring. I wish there where a “records mode” type of option, not because I don´t like heroes, rather because it would bee more challenging in certain situations to have a generals retinue. The Daemon Prince for example is kinda weak and tends to be useless. Balthasar Gelt can almost alone defeat armies with his magic artillery spells. Another solution would be to rebalanced the heroes.Unit size: I also find the unit sizes of the different units quite small, this is important since this game is supposed to be an fantasy epic, but with tiny battles. Well, what about fixing this with mods? You can, there are mods in the workshop that increase the unit size, however, the AI tends to get stuck at the gate and exhibit odd and often devastating (for them) behavior. While, in three kingdoms I use similar mods and have massive battles with a full stack army almost reaching 10,000 warriors. The AI in Three Kingdoms doesn’t exhibit the same issues.AI: I personally find the AI a bit lackluster compared to other titles, though not as catastrophic as Thrones of Britannia. It’s not bad, just not cutting it for an experienced player like me. I also tend to be against increasing the difficulty to legendary, due to the AI getting modifier boosts, thus I prefer to use a AI mod that makes the AI smarter instead. Found that Hecleas AI Mod works well. Diplomacy: I find that the diplomatic options to interact with other factions are a bit limited. Currently you can sway someone with giving them money, but you can’t for example trade ancillaries like in Three Kingdoms. Sometimes I might be just short of getting that trade agreement, but not enough money to to finish the deal, while sitting on a pile of old/useless ancillaries that I could do away with.Linux: Works great, I personally have used it with Proton and played with my friends.SummaryHmm, it’s a good total war game in my view, but not a great one. The game looks just gorgeous and is pure eye-candy, the fantasy setting is also interesting. If you really love fantasy, stuff like Lord of the Rings etc. then you might find the full price justified, but if Fantasy is cool, but not your absolute favorite thing then, I would personally recommend waiting for a -50% sale and then get it.",sieg battl sieg full choke point littl open space unit scale wall arent equipp unit dont drag ladder wall battl gener simpl total war titl feel like took challeng game order make appeal wider audienc graphic best aspect opinion game look gorgeou map immort empir patch get entir world greatlor feel game could tell stori bit three kingdom cutscen reach certain goal get idea feel event around hero sometim hero get bit jar wish record mode type option dont like hero rather would bee challeng certain situat gener retinu daemon princ exampl kinda weak tend useless balthasar gelt almost alon defeat armi magic artilleri spell anoth solut would rebalanc heroesunit size also find unit size differ unit quit small import sinc game suppos fantasi epic tini battl well fix mod mod workshop increas unit size howev ai tend get stuck gate exhibit odd often devast behavior three kingdom use similar mod massiv battl full stack armi almost reach warrior ai three kingdom doesnt exhibit issuesai person find ai bit lacklust compar titl though catastroph throne britannia bad cut experienc player like also tend increas difficulti legendari due ai get modifi boost thu prefer use ai mod make ai smarter instead found heclea ai mod work well diplomaci find diplomat option interact faction bit limit current sway someon give money cant exampl trade ancillari like three kingdom sometim might short get trade agreement enough money finish deal sit pile olduseless ancillari could away withlinux work great person use proton play friendssummaryhmm good total war game view great one game look gorgeou pure eyecandi fantasi set also interest realli love fantasi stuff like lord ring etc might find full price justifi fantasi cool absolut favorit thing would person recommend wait sale get

"2023 I was in a Tomb Kings Mortal Empires campaign on WHII when I bought Warhammer III, I started the same campaign to compare. The difference was instantly noticeable, especially in terms of the diplomacy system. The improvements are so significant that going back to WHII felt like a step backward. The diplomacy in WHIII actually makes sense now!Outposts makes complete sense in the context of the game, whether you're building them yourself or getting them from allies. It adds an extra layer to the strategy and alliances.The Quality of Life improvements are also great. Things like auto-building and an easier level-up system have made the gameplay smoother. However, there's still no auto level-up feature, which is a shame. But hey, Middenheim wasn't built in a day, right?The game world is also significantly larger this time around, which is a massive plus. There's so much more to explore and conquer, adding to the depth and longevity of the game.That being said, the campaign map leaves much to be desired in terms of performance. It's not as big of a deal as some people make it out to be, but it's certainly not a highlight of the game. While the map struggles to maintain 40-50 FPS, the battles are a different story altogether. The battles run at a crisp 60+ FPS, making each clash a visually stunning spectacle.So far I had one crash during my battle, one that stopped happening once I disabled 'Control by AI' for my alliance army.In the grand scheme of things, Warhammer III is a huge step forward for the franchise.

"2022 The third and final game in a series that allowed Warhammer to become cool for a brief time.✔️ In 1 year this will probably be good, (When modders and other people have done Creative Assembly's Job).✔️ New (But buggy as hell) Minor Settlement & Battle types.✔️ New factions at-least play differently; although some seem much stronger than others.❓Art style has changed to a more Cell shaded style. Feels a little diss-jointed when playing a faction all about death and plague.❓UI Re-Vamped to match different art style. ❓Single campaign but more to come (no idea when though) ❌ Main menu wouldn't be out of place in a mobile game. Did you fire the UX team wtf?.❌ This game runs like cyberpunk for me? (3070 ti, 5950 CPU) I rarely hit 60 fps, i stutter at 20FPS on the campaign map, the cut-scenes skip frames? Legit struggling to play this game right now. ❌ Unit Roster is laughable, Some factions have like 10 troops. I don't think there are even 50 unique units across all the factions, (Bare in mind Radious-Mod added 300+ new units) You've had years to make these, most of the humanoids use the exact same skeleton and animations did you run out of ideas??.❌ Cannot play old factions (even in custom games or multiplayer) You are literately limited to the 8 new factions right now..... Even though on the Campaign Menu if you select ""Unit & Spell Browser"" You can actually select all the other factions in the game before it reverts back... ❌ No workshop support? What the ♥♥♥♥? Modder's literally carry these titles because Creative Assembly (ironically) have no Creativity.❌ Super bare bones and lacking (like all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tipple AAA games these days). ❌ Tutorial (Prologue) crashes for me each time, Ended up skipping this..❌ Enjoy an array of new bugs! Such as- losing battles even though troops are still alive. Losing battles because your troops become stuck in the new minor settlements. Losing battles because you've destroyed the AI's wall, then they instantly re-build it at full HP splitting your army in half!❌ WAY less content on release than the previous 2 titles.",third final game seri allow warhamm becom cool brief time year probabl good modder peopl done creativ assembl job new buggi hell minor settlement battl type new faction atleast play differ although seem much stronger othersart style chang cell shade style feel littl dissjoint play faction death plagueui revamp match differ art style singl campaign come idea though main menu wouldnt place mobil game fire ux team wtf game run like cyberpunk ti cpu rare hit fp stutter campaign map cutscen skip frame legit struggl play game right unit roster laughabl faction like troop dont think even uniqu unit across faction bare mind radiousmod ad new unit youv year make humanoid use exact skeleton anim run idea play old faction even custom game multiplay liter limit new faction right even though campaign menu select unit spell browser actual select faction game revert back workshop support modder liter carri titl creativ assembl iron creativ super bare bone lack like tippl aaa game day tutori prologu crash time end skip enjoy array new bug lose battl even though troop still aliv lose battl troop becom stuck new minor settlement lose battl youv destroy ai wall instantli rebuild full hp split armi half way less content releas previou titl

"2022 The game has teething issues for sure, but any game of this size is going to. The first patch smoothed a lot of the corners and the roadmap demonstrated that they're in this for the long haul of improvements and content drops as things go on. In terms of its improvements over TWW1 and 2, the game has mostly shown improvement, a few things have stayed more or less the same, and there's been a couple of declines, so overall good. The map design is improved, the campaign map is one of the largest and most interesting in the series, the unit variance is nice, there are very distinct factions and races, diplomacy is better, battles are better, magic is better, and there's generally more content in here at launch than either of the two predecessor games. The main campaign is iffy in terms of its goals and how you get there, but ultimately plays out fine. It has a lot of potential to be better but hard to say how far out they'll develop the ideas. The RoC has a lot better potential than (and to me is more enjoyable than) the Vortex campaign of game 2. If the RoC Campaign doesn't get hugely expanded it's still mostly fine, just isn't sure how to get its ideas together. The combined map will ultimately be good, so like game 2 I'll be able to go between them to keep it fresh. One of the best improvements this game has is in the Co-op campaign aspects. FINALLY we can do 3+ player campaigns and it is glorious fun. Co-op campaigns have been vastly improved, the way turns work and alliances etc. is far more nuanced and interesting than it was. Playing co-op often improves an average campaign, but the Realms of Chaos main campaign almost feels like it was designed with co-op in mind, as it makes the race for souls more interesting and factions can work to cover each other as others do the race. The race itself is usually over within 150 turns, and from there you have a giant map to conquer so it's not a big deal really and we've been having a lot of fun with it. I've seen people disappointed over how long it's going to take for the combined map between the games to come out but anyone with a basic grasp of reality can see that this is a monumental sized project so of course it's going to take time for things to happen. That's kinda just physics at play really, but as with the other two games things will come out as they do and the game will only get better. WH2 at the end of its cycle was an amazing game and WH3 will likely be no different. Overall, I recommend the game and I'm looking forward to what's coming later this year.",game teeth issu sure game size go first patch smooth lot corner roadmap demonstr theyr long haul improv content drop thing go term improv game mostli shown improv thing stay less there coupl declin overal good map design improv campaign map one largest interest seri unit varianc nice distinct faction race diplomaci better battl better magic better there gener content launch either two predecessor game main campaign iffi term goal get ultim play fine lot potenti better hard say far theyll develop idea roc lot better potenti enjoy vortex campaign game roc campaign doesnt get huge expand still mostli fine isnt sure get idea togeth combin map ultim good like game ill abl go keep fresh one best improv game coop campaign aspect final player campaign gloriou fun coop campaign vastli improv way turn work allianc etc far nuanc interest play coop often improv averag campaign realm chao main campaign almost feel like design coop mind make race soul interest faction work cover other race race usual within turn giant map conquer big deal realli weve lot fun ive seen peopl disappoint long go take combin map game come anyon basic grasp realiti see monument size project cours go take time thing happen that kinda physic play realli two game thing come game get better end cycl amaz game like differ overal recommend game im look forward what come later year

"2022 FIrst of all: i still play this game casually from time to time, it's good but still, the release was a total mess and now that IE (Beta) dropped out a few days ago, there's a bit more content and there is still so much potential.If you play co-op campaign with more than one other friend, very often from round 30-35 there will be a desync error and this can break the entire campaign for you and your friends. No previous save file or restart of the game will help you. It's like there's that one specific timer triggering the desync error and you can't play beyond that point. This happens in RoC and IE. In other words, you have to restart but as long as 3 people play this campaign, this will happen almost every time. If you play with just one more friend it's ok and the error won't occur.Gameplay is sometimes very tedious. Factionwide, all Units suffer some sort of Alzheimers and they will forget orders in a battle. Sometimes they stop midway, sometimes the won't even react in the first place. In this case, you will have to molest your mouse with rapid clicks and start frantically checking the whole map for your units if all of the commands reached their brain or got lost in their track and start sending out commands again. Rince and repeat... until you develope some sort of paranoia. Damn those foul chaos gods of bad programming.They changed the minor settlement fights so every battle will be a siege (with walls to climb, gates to destroy an points to take) and it's just time consuming. Auto-resolve is still a joke even when you have a good and experienced army, so enjoy fight from now on manually. Imagine playing past round 100 and still expanding your faction. Of all Battles, 80% will be at settlements and therefor a siege battle. Optimization of this game could be better. There were some tweaks but with the release of IE, frame drops and long loading screens are more common again.The current price tag is too damn high for a game that is still in Beta and probably will be for the next 1-2 years, so I don't recommend it in it's current state. If you're about to get your first total war: warhammer, don't let it be this one. There are still two others to chose from._______________________________________________________________________Update after the ""Shadows of Change"" Update:it still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sucks.

"2022 Okay, I think it's okay to say now. Having gotten through those first two patches, (1.1 & 1.2) the game is now safe to recommend. Initially, I think CA had botched it. The patches that addressed the build to reduce portals (1.1) and the auto-resolve (1.2) have saved this game. It is now in a place where I can more enjoy the mechanics and tempo of the game.Yes, once the big map that joins the three games AND all the races together will be what we've all been waiting for. But for now, getting familiar with the new and very different races and race mechanics, the minor settlement rework, the constant threat of the portal race that means you can still lose even when steamrolling. Yeah, this is a good game and I'm enjoying it.Would I have said that a month or so ago?

"2022 Reason for PurchaseI love the entire Souls Like series. I started with Bloodborne earlier and then moved on to Dark Souls. After that I played Demon Souls which I thought was fantastic. And then I heard that ''From Software'' is releasing a new part which should even have an open world. At first I was a bit skeptical because I didn't know how ''From Software'' would deal with this new idea but I could say... They exceeded all my expectations.GraphicThe graphics are truly stunning. Everything is designed in such detail. Both the world (which I still haven't fully explored) as well as the NPS's, enemies, bosses and much more. What I want to say is that I can't see the graph difference between Low and Maximum. From that point of view, I mainly play on Low so that everything runs smoothly.Game MechanicsI haven't played a Souls Like part on PC before. However, I have to say that it was implemented very well. And besides, I love this game more than any other Souls Like parts and for a reason. There is a separate jump button! In the other parts it was or is quite annoying and sometimes hectic when you have to press several buttons at the same time.Positive and negativeFrom my point of view, there is nothing negative anymore. Previously, for me, the negative was that it came to such frequent game crashes. Now there is nothing negative for me anymore. The price of Elden Ring does justice to the game in everything. So ''From Software'' has really surpassed itself.FutureI'm going to play Elden Ring for a very long time, as I haven't fully explored the Big World yet. My goal will be to reach the maximum ''99'' for all stats. I also hope that there will be DLC expansions at some point. In addition, I would like to see a few more achievements because I now have them all.Game RatingGraphic: 10☆ <3Game Mechanics: 9☆Spielspaß: 10☆Recommendation of the gameElden Ring is in my opinion a good game to get in because you can get a lot of support from the incantations of ghosts. If you add another player, the boss gets even more life than usual, which is why I would prefer the ghosts.

"1440p, RTX 3080 user here.The game is awesome, and it runs very well if tweaked correctly - below are my suggestions.First of all, download DLSS Swapper, as the game is using an older DLSS version you can improve on it by swapping to the latest version (3.7.2).About the graphic settings, these are the 2 most demanding ones:Shadows > going from VERY HIGH to HIGH I was able to gain 8-10 fps on averageGlobal Illumination > same as shadows, going from VERY HIGH to HIGH I was able to gain 10 fps on averageSo with only these two settings I went from 55 to 75 fps.All the other settings give minor fps returns.My suggested settings for people with an rtx 3080 / 3070ti are:- DLSS at 80%- Textures on Cinematic- Shadow on High- Global Illumination on High- Everything else on very high (you can crank up Hair Quality and Vegetation Quality to Cinematic with just a 2-3 fps loss)The only downside for me at the moment is the lack of a FOV slider.I'm very sensitive to narrow FOV but so far I was able to play without getting sick, will update this review if things change.",rtx user hereth game awesom run well tweak correctli suggestionsfirst download dlss swapper game use older dlss version improv swap latest version graphic set demand onesshadow go high high abl gain fp averageglob illumin shadow go high high abl gain fp averageso two set went fpsall set give minor fp returnsmi suggest set peopl rtx dlss textur cinemat shadow high global illumin high everyth els high crank hair qualiti veget qualiti cinemat fp lossth downsid moment lack fov sliderim sensit narrow fov far abl play without get sick updat review thing chang

"What we have here is a weird mixture of various other games with some unique ideas thrown in. The problem is that it all feels really just slapped together. Your character isn't overly responsive and feels like he weighs 8 tons while you're moving around. The general combat is okay though, its nothing amazing but its a very solid foundation that they can build on.The building is terrible, its just bad. The basics are all there but the building itself is uncomfortable and very very finicky. They at least have a free move building camera and that does help but the snapping is troublesome and not intuitive. Having to get the exact right angle on something like a roof panel is cumbersome and it took me about three times as long to just get a roof over my head than it should have.There is a decent variety of things to build and you've got pretty free range to build as you see fit. However the build radius itself, at least where I was at in the progression was very small so I felt very limited. Placing things works well enough, easy enough to rotate things around and there is a decent tech tree to work through.Resource gathering is more or less painless and its what you would expect. Hack at trees to get wood, go find copper or whatever else to mine. Nothing felt like it took too long to amass if you just spend a few minutes doing it. I do like the crafting queue feature at each of the crafting stations, frees you up to go do whatever while you wait for it to do its thing and nothing took all that long to complete.The skills system itself... is a bit confusing. There is this whole what I am guessing is like a pokemon type of system. You can obtain new little critters or deviants I guess they call them to put in your backpack and each has its own skills to use. I only found 2 during my time, the butterfly and a little jelly guy. The butterfly was just some extra dps that would do it when you toss it at something, the jelly guy could turn into cover or act as defense. I honestly forgot I had them most of the time. I got to around level 12 and only fought one thing that put up any sort of resistance. The first rift boss, big thing with some basic mechanics that I was able to match make into..It wasn't hard or anything, had some bare minimum mechanics and it fell overEvery other enemy I came across wasn't a threat.. like at all. The general zombie like guys you see everywhere all are dead before they even know you're there. Couple of weird big cat things with a tarp over their head? They also die easily all you need to do is back pedal while you fight them and they can't hit you. the AI is on a level of PS2 games. Although i genuinely think some PS2 games had better enemy AI than this gameCouple of other larger creatures, couldn't even tell you what they do because they all just fell over dead with nothing but the basic pistol you get shortly after the tutorial. Most enemies seem to have 2 or 3 different attacks that they just spam at random and very slow.What bothered me the most was that you could just see everyone's structures.. everywhere.. you can't go anywhere without seeing someone's little base or forward respawn point. Its just urban sprawl on an active server.. stuff built everywhere and it just was goofy to see. I mean I get it, its going to happen in a game where you can build if its a public server but this was just obscene. Anyone who had played something like old school starwars galaxies know what Im talking about.. houses.. houses as far as the eye can see concentrated around the major areas. It just.. feel bad and sorta takes me out of the whole thing. There is no point in finding a cool place to build or even a unique base design because there is just stuff everywhere and everyone's place looks more or less the same. Im sure that gets better in the later areas but its just a pretty big turn off for me.Graphically, its pretty good. No real complaints. Game looks and ran great. Its not the best visually but in the genre its in, its a good contender for good visuals. No real visual glitches or anything weird happening. Very solid on that front.I might give it another go later, but I think I saw everything I needed to see. It just didn't grab me, For a free game? Seems okay, but there is just too much competition out there that do what they're trying to do but better. Since its free, id say pick it up if your curious, but don't expect something that is just gonna draw you in and make you want to keep going. I lost stream really quickly on it and its a real shame, had alot of potential but alas.

"2023 Orginal review:The game has enormous potential and lets you play a lot of completely different factions with unique playstyles, but unfortunately there are simply too many issues for me to be able to recommend it. It launched in a pretty sorry state and hasn't really gotten better since then. There are a lot of bugs, some of them still present since launch. The AI poses no challenge whatsoever, since it wastes a lot of time running around just outside of your attack range and it loves to sack or raze your weakest settlements, rather than going after cities that actually matter. Units in battle tend to circle each other forever instead of attacking, the list goes on. And while the game is in dire need of improvements and bugfixes, all it's getting right now is absurdly overpriced DLC, alongside a lackluster free patch that seems to break at least as many things as it fixes.Update:While the AI issues persist (though the game did get harder thanks to the AI getting huge bonuses in lieu of being actually taught how to play), the game has begun getting regular free fixes and new features, to the point where I'm comfortable saying that it's a great experience, and chances are it's going to get even better.",orgin reviewth game enorm potenti let play lot complet differ faction uniqu playstyl unfortun simpli mani issu abl recommend launch pretti sorri state hasnt realli gotten better sinc lot bug still present sinc launch ai pose challeng whatsoev sinc wast lot time run around outsid attack rang love sack raze weakest settlement rather go citi actual matter unit battl tend circl forev instead attack list goe game dire need improv bugfix get right absurdli overpr dlc alongsid lacklust free patch seem break least mani thing fixesupdatewhil ai issu persist though game get harder thank ai get huge bonus lieu actual taught play game begun get regular free fix new featur point im comfort say great experi chanc go get even better

"Listen, I might get flak for this, but this isn't a $60 title. The campaign is 6 missions, the post campaign PvE is 6 missions. You could knock this out in a couple days, maybe an afternoon if you're really good or have friends, and if you don't much care for PvP (which has 3 maps and 3 modes in total) that is all of the content you have aside from what they're going to dripfeed over several seasons, and I just don't really consider that acceptable for the price point, unless you REALLY like the combat system, which I personally am not particularly in love with. This could've been like $40 and I'd have less issue with the barebones amount of content here. I'm not saying it couldn't improve over the seasons, but if you want to buy it at the time of writing, I think you'd be at risk for being disappointed like myself.",listen might get flak isnt titl campaign mission post campaign pve mission could knock coupl day mayb afternoon your realli good friend dont much care pvp map mode total content asid theyr go dripfe sever season dont realli consid accept price point unless realli like combat system person particularli love couldv like id less issu barebon amount content im say couldnt improv season want buy time write think youd risk disappoint like

"2018 I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5.It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time. Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006. We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland.However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again. CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get. Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me. If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.

"2022 I have not played since launch day, (other than 5 mins to check if it ran better with a new GPU, it did. Still significantly worse performance than WH2) and will not play again at least until Immortal Empires, and maybe not then. The fact that the lukewarm reception to the Vortex campaign should have been an indication to seek to emulate the mortal empires experience, not double down on the vortex type mechanics.Any game that requires mods to have a good gameplay experience does not deserve a positive review. I appreciate that the modding community has been so quick to make so many good changes, but does not change the fact the modding community should be for creativity, rather than fixing blatant issues in the game itself.Somewhat ironically, the tutorial campaign was one of the best tutorials I've ever seen in a game. I didn't need it to teach me, but I play ever TW tutorial anyway, and this was definitely the best one. But, the tutorial campaign is a one-off thing, and does not compensate for the lacking of the main campaign.For newcomers to Total warhammer, WH3 is likely completely fine. But for those who played many, many hours of WH2, it falls flat, well short of what it should've been. Based an what we've seen so far, the game should've been kept in development for at least another year. A poor showing.",play sinc launch day min check ran better new gpu still significantli wors perform play least immort empir mayb fact lukewarm recept vortex campaign indic seek emul mortal empir experi doubl vortex type mechanicsani game requir mod good gameplay experi deserv posit review appreci mod commun quick make mani good chang chang fact mod commun creativ rather fix blatant issu game itselfsomewhat iron tutori campaign one best tutori ive ever seen game didnt need teach play ever tw tutori anyway definit best one tutori campaign oneoff thing compens lack main campaignfor newcom total warhamm like complet fine play mani mani hour fall flat well short shouldv base weve seen far game shouldv kept develop least anoth year poor show

"Has it's flaws and fair share of bugs. CA have been on a downer but looking good with their new DLC Thrones of Decay. Overall it's so fun and very mod friendly so you can have so much replay ability. Few things need to be fixed such as AI and siege battles. DLC's can be overwhelming and expensive for first time players, but there is also plenty of freeLC to try. Id recommend trying a few races, see what you like then consider buying the DLC for that race. My favorite and most valuable DLC in my opinion is anything to do with the Lizardmen, Forge of the Chaos Dwarfs, Beastmen and Prophet and the Warlock. There is other good DLC but i find these offer the most... Overall the game could be better and has more potential, and i love it even for it's flaws.

"9 / 10 For me, this is one of the best games in history! This game is proof that a project doesn't need battle passes, paid cosmetics, or in-game shops to be successful. This is probably one of the most passionate games released in the past decade; the creativity and attention to detail are absolutely insane.Starting with one of the top selling points: the graphics. The graphics are absolutely absurd; Unreal Engine 5 is the best-looking engine on the market as of 2024, and this game makes very good use of it. Yes, using UE5 means that the game sometimes has some high optimization problems, although they're minor compared to other UE5 titles released recently.The combat and enemy variety in this game are simply absurd. Elden Ring is an amazing game, and even a game of that caliber still struggles to keep up with this game variety-wise. Every single enemy in this game is unique and original, with highly detailed models and movesets; there's only a very small amount of reused assets among the enemies and bosses. Some of the boss fights are creative enough to make your jaw drop. The game has a lot of different skills and movesets, transformations, and items to make the combat feel unique in each encounter. Although I gotta admit that I wish it had more spells.The biggest problem with this game compared to other action games is definitely the limitations on exploration of the map. This game has an absurd amount of invisible walls and limitations on the terrain blocking exploration, sometimes even on clear paths that look like they'd be explorable otherwise. And this is the reason i'm not giving this game a 10/10.The soundtrack fits very well with the theme of the game; the OSTs are magical and epic. Each chapter has an animation at the end with different art styles and music, with different stories and meanings. For a person who is not used to the main theme portrayed in this game, it's a magical experience for sure...I would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in Chinese folklore and mythology. The story is amazing; I was totally unfamiliar with anything related to this theme, and after playing it, I gotta say I really want to know more about the general theme and meaning behind these stories.I genuinely believe this game will be remembered throughout the years as one of the most passionate and successful projects in gaming history.",one best game histori game proof project doesnt need battl pass paid cosmet ingam shop success probabl one passion game releas past decad creativ attent detail absolut insanestart one top sell point graphic graphic absolut absurd unreal engin bestlook engin market game make good use ye use mean game sometim high optim problem although theyr minor compar titl releas recentlyth combat enemi varieti game simpli absurd elden ring amaz game even game calib still struggl keep game varietywis everi singl enemi game uniqu origin highli detail model moveset there small amount reus asset among enemi boss boss fight creativ enough make jaw drop game lot differ skill moveset transform item make combat feel uniqu encount although got ta admit wish spellsth biggest problem game compar action game definit limit explor map game absurd amount invis wall limit terrain block explor sometim even clear path look like theyd explor otherwis reason im give game soundtrack fit well theme game ost magic epic chapter anim end differ art style music differ stori mean person use main theme portray game magic experi surei would definit recommend game anyon interest chines folklor mytholog stori amaz total unfamiliar anyth relat theme play got ta say realli want know gener theme mean behind storiesi genuin believ game rememb throughout year one passion success project game histori

I wish there was an option to play it without the Chaos Realms, similar to how you could pick to omit Chaos invasions in the first and second game. Somehow the campaign and sieges are worse than earlier entries. I would pick Eye of the storm over this and that is saying something.Every ""improvement"" they advertised has been a net negative compared to other games, and somehow old bugs are even worse. strategy doesn't really mean much when units hardly respond to your inputs.Units look great, but a lot of the visual presentation has taken a hit. I get wanting to add more color to the game, but a lot of the models just look too cartoony, especially the trees as many people have already pointed out.

"2022 Elden Ring, O Elden Ring. You already know why it's so good, but like Dark Souls, the game is a sad tale of two halves. The first half is absolutely brilliant; an open world experience that encourages a lot of exploration. It really took me back to the good old days of playing video games with a sense of wonder and curiosity. The second half of the game however, is really all the bad things about the new Souls games. Unbalanced and unfun, just stacking ""le epic"" boss after boss and making them difficult for the sake of difficult. Gone are the memorable bosses of True King Allant and Gwyn, but now replaced with bosses who have to be a ""spectacle"" and ""action-orientated"" for the sake of the fanbase.

"2015 Update:Suggestions:- Big Update: Overwatch2.0:=> Overwatch Reviewer can send one gotv demo manually to the system once every 24 hours and as long the ban rate of their send-ins is high they can still do it. This would crush cheating=> Overwatch sases shouldn't show Skins anymore to make it as objective as possible=> There shouldn't be a waiting time anymore between Overwatch cases=> Overwatch shouldn't be done with the demo system, but in the main menu with streamed videos. This would remove the loading time, waiting time, it would be easier to skip back and fourth for personal needs to see a situation again etc.=> A statement of valve that skipping cases til the end is allowed when you're sure he cheated=> In case this data isn't necessary: Remove all 3 major cheating parts and put it together to one: ""Cheating"". This in general is enough and would increase the ban rate by a lot since the investigator doesn't have to review the whole case just to find out if a waller+aimbotter used a bhop script or anti aim for ""external assistance"" and some point.- Separation of unranked prime and non prime: No prime player currently wants to play unranked because the amount of cheater is too high.- No overwatch in non prime matches: Most of the current cases in overwatch are fresh made throw away accs playing in non prime. There is no reason to ban them. They will just create a new acc in 2 seconds.- Removing the rank in dangerzone OR adding overwatch for dangerzone - both will prevent cheating a bit.- Prime2.0 -> Whoever verifies his profile with a personal ID will get it. Verifying multiple accounts is possible, but all will have the same rank to avoid smurfs. Also if one acc gets banned, all current and future accs with that person ID will get autobanned. The ESL is doing this succesful since 2005German source:https://play.eslgaming.com/news/133942/Die-ESL-Playercard/- Matchmaking Seasons: Every 6 months a new season should start. Player will receive a coin each season with the highest reached rank they've received in that season. Ranks don't reset entirely in a new season, but drop like this:* Any Silver player will drop to Silver 1* Any Gold Nova player will drop to Gold Nova 1* Any MG-DMG player will drop to MG1* Any LE-Global player will drop to LE- Nerf the deagle base damage so 2 hit kills in the body aren't possible anymore. At the same time decrease the damage dropoff so the damage is the same on mid- to high range.- Remove the spread of sniper weapons and inaccuracy when just scoping in- Fix the OBS issue. Valve destroyed usual streaming just because they can't deal with possible cheater.- Valve should work together with Youtube, Twitch and any other Streamingplatform to manually ban cheater on their Steam- and Social-Account- Individual buy menu: People should be able to manually set their buy menu for their needs including sets of things they want to buy. Most people for example don't buy a m249 ever.

"Game looks fantastic and campagne is fun. Difficulty GAP in PvE is too big. From 2nd to 3rd difficulty it'S just stupid. Enemies are one category higher for you when fighting them with green equipment (meaning that every enemy feels like one category higher, so tyranid warrior takes same amount of damage as leaper and so on) and there is no way how to get to the better weapons other than play and win through harder difficulties. With all premade you can die your way there, but for anything else it's just like play Helldivers 2 in their worst. Game provides you with epic melee stuff, but whole meta of 3rd and 4th difficulty is ""DON'T EVER GO IN MELEE"" so all these mighty space marines are rolling like potatopes on the ground, while being folowed by vawes and vawes enemies imune to light melee attacks and while sm burning you with flamer/ shooting you with bolters and you can do JACK SH*T.Melee chars except bulwark are useless, you will do better with 2 chars with melta and one that kills specials on range.Whole relience on dodge/perry/gunstrike changes this game from horde shooter into frustrating and very unfair rolly polly simulator.I have no interest in PvP so i can't judge that.Locking fun behind the hard wall is stupid decission and i'm very sad that i can't get my money back.",game look fantast campagn fun difficulti gap pve big difficulti stupid enemi one categori higher fight green equip mean everi enemi feel like one categori higher tyranid warrior take amount damag leaper way get better weapon play win harder difficulti premad die way anyth els like play helldiv worst game provid epic mele stuff whole meta difficulti dont ever go mele mighti space marin roll like potatop ground folow vaw vaw enemi imun light mele attack sm burn flamer shoot bolter jack shtmele char except bulwark useless better char melta one kill special rangewhol relienc dodgeperrygunstrik chang game hord shooter frustrat unfair rolli polli simulatori interest pvp cant judg thatlock fun behind hard wall stupid deciss im sad cant get money back

"2022 Alright so first of all this, despite all the backlash, isn't an awful game. I'd much rather play release tww 3 than the original, that being said it's not a good game either. CA has pulled the classic 2020s razzle dazzle of releasing a game unfinished and patching it until the backlash stops. With every update until now the game has improved overall even if the bugs kept multiplying. Without a doubt the biggest improvement (at least for me) so far has been the implementation of the mod support which allowed the community to fill negative space in the design and improve the balancing overall. This may change soon though as the immortals empire patch looms over the horizon. Now would I recommend people to buy this game before IE drops? No. That doesn't mean it's not worth playing cause I do like playing it and the implementation of IE will bring such a breadth of content to the game that I have no doubts that it will shake up the reviews however I am both excited and scared of how this will turn out because while I have no doubts IE will have me playing hundreds more hours regardless of quality I can't as of yet make comment on how well implemented it will be and how much love will be shown to it (and future releases). I strongly believe that once this game has gotten the DLC support of TWW2 it will be a good game, perhaps even a great one however I shall leave this review on negative because let's be honest here.

"I am only on chapter 3 but I already feel like I can recommend this game.Forget the vague ""souls-like"" definition, this is an action game that's almost a boss rush with some cool exploration and some regular enemy encounters between each boss. I honestly love the idea of fighting so many 1vs1 fights, against beautifully designed enemies that are different from each other (so far I only found 1 reskinned boss out of 20ish).The combat system is solid, the game doesn't have many combos (which I don't mind) and it requires you to use dodges and skills with the right timing, while you focus on building your own meter for stronger heavy attacks that will also help you to stagger the enemies. Imo it's simple but effective, and you will find a lot of satisfaction in chain-staggering stronger foes with a series of heavy attacks and skills.One thing I have to complain though is navigating the world: the game has no map and a lot of areas that, while visually stunning, don't look too different from each other when you have to remember where something, like a locked door you left behind, was. The enormous amount of invisible walls also makes it hard to tell where you can and cannot go.And since the game has tons of secrets (some of which are very hard to find without a guide), all of this makes finding them even harder and somewhat frustrating.",chapter alreadi feel like recommend gameforget vagu soulslik definit action game that almost boss rush cool explor regular enemi encount boss honestli love idea fight mani fight beauti design enemi differ far found reskin boss combat system solid game doesnt mani combo dont mind requir use dodg skill right time focu build meter stronger heavi attack also help stagger enemi imo simpl effect find lot satisfact chainstagg stronger foe seri heavi attack skillson thing complain though navig world game map lot area visual stun dont look differ rememb someth like lock door left behind enorm amount invis wall also make hard tell goand sinc game ton secret hard find without guid make find even harder somewhat frustrat

"2023 The Anticheat is so bad, it's embarassing for a game this size. Furthermore, Valve has proven over the last 10 years that they don't care about their community, if they just continue to buy skins. All bad changes are kept in the game and most wishes of the playerbase are just ignored without any explanation, regardless of the feedback, e.g. removing the bots if someone leaves the game, doing something against the overwhelming toxic behavior of players, etc.. CS2 is a more beautiful version of CSGO with worse anticheat, badly programmed, a horrendous mappool and worse fps and noone even cared about the aesthetics of the game to begin with. Nice job Valve to gain more money with skins by making the game worse in every other aspect.",anticheat bad embarass game size furthermor valv proven last year dont care commun continu buy skin bad chang kept game wish playerbas ignor without explan regardless feedback eg remov bot someon leav game someth overwhelm toxic behavior player etc beauti version csgo wors anticheat badli program horrend mappool wors fp noon even care aesthet game begin nice job valv gain money skin make game wors everi aspect

"Update to my review. I have to give this a thumbs down now. Its a great game, it really is. But it is RUINED by the insane loading times (I have gig up and down speeds) and that you are FORCED to play with others. If you disconnect your internet, you can play with bots, but it doesnt save ANY of that progress even though you get STEAM accomplishments while offline. It makes ZERO sense. Then there are the skins. While some of them are cool, most are simply just different colors of the exact same armor. Its like the Devs think Space Marines are clones or something. They are meant to be UNIQUE, not cookie cutter. This plague of gaming where folks are forced to be online to play single player games will be the death of PC gaming. This along with the non stop need to have account after account just to play a game is getting plain ridiculous. If you are a 40k fan pick it up purely for the campaign which is EPIC and amazing. The rest of the game is a complete letdown.",updat review give thumb great game realli ruin insan load time gig speed forc play other disconnect internet play bot doesnt save progress even though get steam accomplish offlin make zero sens skin cool simpli differ color exact armor like dev think space marin clone someth meant uniqu cooki cutter plagu game folk forc onlin play singl player game death pc game along non stop need account account play game get plain ridicul fan pick pure campaign epic amaz rest game complet letdown

"2014 Basic GameplayYou play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice.You can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you.On the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?.Anyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode.As a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction.Being a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb.I'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here.Positive attributes :- Matchmaking - Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later)- Ranks - Cool looking skins- Fast growing population of players - Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often- Chickens- High replay value- Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring)Negative attributes :Although I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work. I REALLY wish it were longer.. And that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his ""7 year old could beat you, blindfolded.""- The game mode ""Infernal"" played on the map ""de_inferno""Some people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you.It seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time.- Demolition, Also known as ""jokemode"" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that ""4_chan"" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since)Demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing!The volka StrategyYou could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR you could play the game correctly like me. Here is my strategy :- Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money.- Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get.- Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can.- Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops].- Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops.- Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job.In a whole, I do love this game And would recommend to anyone, Good half, Good half.",basic gameplayy play either counterterrorist terrorist deploy battlefield round give small allow purchas weapon choicey make extra money win round could also hold knife enemi demand money although would riski sinc enemi would like shoot youon terrorist team goal plant explos near uhhm import boxesanyway plant wait patient explodea counterterrorist must elimin terrorist forc defus bomb thu protect ever import box certain destructionb honour oppon terrorist sure set bomb timer long enough give ct chanc slaughter remain ts defus bombil list positiveneg attribut game hereposit attribut matchmak teach children harsh realiti gambl although never seem learn even later rank cool look skin fast grow popul player fat stack loot drop somewhat often chicken high replay valu deathmatch game type could go detail neg part would make review long boringneg attribut although love singl player campaign could use work realli wish longer final boss fight pretti lame last around second time way lose take offens old man constantli insult year old could beat blindfold game mode infern play map deinfernosom peopl like game mode howev person dislik yet chanc experi ill explain youit seem like normal de map howev real goal scurri around find shred scrap rego normal hidden obscur unus section map abil shiftmov around differ locat even leav game entir minut time demolit also known jokemod ad pure joke volvo suppos unlock everi april fool day howev hacker probabl guy perman unlock volvo work fix ever sincedemolit game mode automat give everyon amour requir get kill weapon extrem poor damag armour oppon also block enabl whoa team killingth volka strategyy could play game like noob spend hundr dollar skin could play game correctli like strategi dont buy skin start serious wast money play good hr sell drop get wait steam sale invest mani copi csgo work way copi make sure dont get mani otherwis wont enough time harvest csgo account drop account may diminish return note take hr gameplay activ drop keep play copi frequent maximis drop economi built method buy skin free incom rememb never gambl open case ive made method think time quit day jobin whole love game would recommend anyon good half good half

"2023 I want to recommend this game. I do - I enjoyed WH2 a lot and have some fun moments in WH3. But there are just stupid problems in this game considering it is a direct successor to WH2, and design choices that are just not good.There are still bugs in the game well over a year after release. Ranged units have a hard time firing at targets correctly. Armies can get stuck on agents and be frozen indefinitely. Random crashes can happen in battle maps. Several unit descriptions just don't even match what they actually do/are functionally.The AI are brain dead during sieges. And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I think the main settlement sieges are the worst in ANY total war game since Empire. The defender is actually WORSE off than the attacker with the new capture point system. Defenses don't work all that well. Walls are still worthless. The AI can't defend their settlements for ♥♥♥♥. It is such an epic fail and makes sieges just a pain on both ends. I hate them.Several of the older races (Empire, Dwarves, Dark Elves especially) just feel bland now in immortal empires. The Empires mechanics are terrible. Cathay isn't a finished race. Bretonnia needs attention. Realms of Chaos is a bad campaign, pure and simple. It just isn't all that good. Id welcome arguments to the contrary, but it wasn't well executed for the original characters on release and was insulting that they released WH3 with the game being UNFINISHED. Immortal Empires wasn't out yet. And Cathay wasn't finished and still doesn't feel finished. The new chaos dwarves feel much more fleshed out than they do.CA is half assing a lot of their content. It is infuriating to see. They are capable of doing a much better job, and I cannot recommend any product from them in good faith while they keep putting out games, DLCs and other updates that just aren't up to snuff. Unfinished, unpolished, untested. And they expect us to accept it for what it is, test it for them and wait for months to have proper changes.

It's a gamble whether you'll have fine performance or worse than normal, even on lowest settings. It seems like the copies they gave content creators did NOT have Denuvo, and thus the performance issues, and they added it upon launch so that nobody would be able to take it into account for reviews. That is an absolutely abhorrent thing to do. Something tells me this is a move on SEGA's part, but either way, it should not be tolerated. From this point on, I'd say keep your money, wait until AFTER launch from CA to decide whether or not to buy the game.READ MORE Was this review helpful?

I feel like I SHOULD recommend this game. But it is functionally broken on release. I can't encourage people to alpha test this game for CA at the cost of their own money. I have 32GB of Ram and 8GB of VRAM (RTX 3060). The game barely runs. This is mind boggling because of the HUGE advancements that CA has made optimizing TWWH2! Honestly I still have plenty of mileage to get out of the second game and I'll be playing that while they fix this one. I am 100% positive in a year this game will be incredible and have some excellent DLCs I will certainly buy and a great mortal empires mode. But until it's optimized, the UI is fixed and most importantly they fix the INSANE unit control issues I cannot recommend this game.Seriously the unit control is COMPLETELY broken. I'm not sure if they playtested this build at all. Your units WILL stop moving and stand still and ignore orders. To get ANY melee unit to engage a ANY ranged unit thats running you have to literally sit there and click on them for the ENTIRE time, which you obviously cannot do when you have a 40 unit army. All the other issues WOULD be tolerable. I can deal with some crashing and framerate drops, I can't handle the game actually being unplayable and broken. When your level 40 doomstack skarbrand dies to a single unit of archers because he was afk for legit only 20 seconds because he got a charge off on the unit then fell asleep basically ruins the entire game. Every single one of your units will do this and its exacerbated by more than half the factions represented in the main campaign being ranged focused or hybrid.TL:DR DO NOT play right now. Wait for the game to actually finish it's development cycle and this will be a masterpiece, similar to how TWWH2 went from a 6/10 to 10/10 in 3 years. This game WILL be amazing, but if you are on the fence then he at least you know you'll get the game for 10-20 bucks later when all of US have finished alpha testing it for you.READ MORE Was this review helpful?

This likely would not be the case if it shipped with Mortal Empires on day one, and did not elect to release without add the very least a skin-and-bones placeholder version of the Chaos Dwarves, instead using Orks as a placeholder.The game itself runs somewhat poorly, it is not well optimized, however this can be mitigated by running at a decreased resolution and lowered textures. This, however, is entirely temporary, and shouldn't factor into your interest, but only your interest *immediately*. Unless you're a huge fan of Kislev, Cathay, Chaos, or the Ogre Kingdoms, I would highly suggest DELAYING your purchase until the future when there is more content to be had, as your time will likely be better spent in Warhammer II where you will still have access to the content from Warhammer I and II.That being said, Chaos is an extremely well designed faction from a gameplay standpoint and has some unique mechanics that stand out from anything else Creative Assembly has ever made. Having tried out the first several turns of most factions by now, I can safely, but unfortunately say that the Legion of Chaos is by far my favorite, which is unfortunate to me because I was mostly looking forward to the Ogre Kingdoms.As for the Campaign, it is about as sandboxy as Vortex was, but with a new mechanic involving the invasion of each realm of Chaos to slay a Daemon Prince, as opposed to completing rituals as in Warhammer II. I personally enjoy it.Lastly, the minor settlements and siege battles. I am not as adverse to the change as other people are. While the supply system is bizarre at best, I'm not convinced that it is entirely detrimental to gameplay, after playing a few rounds, however, I would appreciate a setting to be able to disable this mechanic and return to the old design. I do enjoy the designs of the maps, though, and I really like the new survival mode for custom battles.At it's current state I would suggest waiting for further updates unless you're a die-hard fan of Total War Fantasy or any of the Races in Warhammer III, barring of course Chaos Dwarves.I run an old AM3 CPU, 8gb of DDR3 RAM, and a GTX 1050ti, which is an extremely obsolete setup for this game. However, after twiddling with the settings, Im able to run the game at about 57fps, which is tolerable to me. It is possible for me to gain almost 100fps at very low settings, but the blurriness strains my eyes.I'd give it about a 7/10 right now. You might enjoy it, conditionally, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.READ MORE Was this review helpful?

"edited review: I gave the game another chance because IGN and crybaby reviewers hate the game and the developer, 10/10 game, runs flawlessly now.

"2017 Product received for free After playing the game for roughly 500 hours, I have come to a point that I should express my opinion about the game's current state.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a highly competitive game that focuses on team wo--. Really? You REALLY think im going to describe this game as the perfect cut gem of an E-Sports title?.... well, you came to the wrong review comrade!In essence, CS:GO in its current state has some things you really wouldn't want in a game of this type:-Cheaters/VAC:Most of them obviously have been cheating for a long time, but what does valve care? The only thing useful they do is milk their games for money until they are bone dry and deserted. I just can't get over that fact that valve hasn't actually ""noticed"" that their anti-cheat has flaws, but instead they keep releasing more useless items than bug fixing updates for the game itself.-Griefers:They are not really common nowadays, but back in the day every 5/10 - 6/10 competitive matches i went would have atleast 1 griefer that didn't do anything but insult,generally discriminate or just flat-out do absolutely nothing to help the team win a single round. These individuals are most commonly found on the lower ranks, from my experience.-SMURFS:I have seen more smurfs in cs:go matchmaking than in the actual cartoon itself.Basically this ruins the game for new players by giving them the appearance that CS:GO just isn't worth playing if you don't know how.-THE SALTENING BEGINS:Do you want to experience more highly concentrated amounts of salt in one match than in a salt mine, followed by a community of 12 year olds more cancerous than the radiation levels at Chernobyl? Well my friend, CS:GO is the game for you! (Warranty for broken mice, keyboards, screens, headsets, desks, windows, and possibly hands from hitting your desk too hard not included.)-Servers:When I mean servers I don't intend to talk about the ping/lag, but instead about how most of the time I get matched against/with people from the other side of the damn galaxy. (This is good if you want to learn how everyone has had sexual intercourse with your family members/pets in diverse languages, while you simultaneously proceed to lose the match.)TL;DR:CS:GO is a game that gives everybody a different experience (Unless you are playing in russia, then it's always B rushed every round). Cringy jokes aside, I think this game is somewhat addicting and pleasant in the long run, despite the initial steep learning curve. If valve ever decides to ACTUALLY update their anti-cheat system I will be more than happy to play this game more often.Cheers,James.",product receiv free play game roughli hour come point express opinion game current statecounterstrik global offens highli competit game focus team wo realli realli think im go describ game perfect cut gem esport titl well came wrong review comradein essenc csgo current state thing realli wouldnt want game typecheatersvacmost obvious cheat long time valv care thing use milk game money bone dri desert cant get fact valv hasnt actual notic anticheat flaw instead keep releas useless item bug fix updat game itselfgriefersthey realli common nowaday back day everi competit match went would atleast griefer didnt anyth insultgener discrimin flatout absolut noth help team win singl round individu commonli found lower rank experiencesmurfsi seen smurf csgo matchmak actual cartoon itselfbas ruin game new player give appear csgo isnt worth play dont know howth salten beginsdo want experi highli concentr amount salt one match salt mine follow commun year old cancer radiat level chernobyl well friend csgo game warranti broken mice keyboard screen headset desk window possibl hand hit desk hard includedserverswhen mean server dont intend talk pinglag instead time get match againstwith peopl side damn galaxi good want learn everyon sexual intercours famili memberspet divers languag simultan proceed lose matchtldrcsgo game give everybodi differ experi unless play russia alway b rush everi round cringi joke asid think game somewhat addict pleasant long run despit initi steep learn curv valv ever decid actual updat anticheat system happi play game oftencheersjam

However I can not support or recommend it based on their business tactics.Especially for newcomers BUYER BEWARE:You need the old games DLC in order to unlock A LOT of the content (see the dlc list below 'Add to Cart'. At the time of writing this that is just a bit over $250 (CAD) not including the last two $33.50 DLC that they have added oh and if you want blood you'll need to add another $4.99... so $324.30 all in (for DLC) with base game more than $400 Also note that looking at my purchase receipts all of the DLC for Warhammer 2 was increased from what I paid (back in 2018-2021) so they are also gouging you.

"2022 Elden Ring is, without a doubt, one of the best open-world games ever released, and among the gaming ""Hall of Fame"" of the past decade - among the likes of Skyrim, Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption 2, God of War, and Breath of the Wild.The best features, among many, have to be its unique and refined artistic style and direction, detailed world and lore, mysterious yet alluring characters, incredible bosses and visual effects, and the wide array of weapons and magic at your disposal.The biggest area to nitpick is the graphical fidelity, which, for this time, is outdated. However, as mentioned before, it has an unparalleled artistic design, with a look and feel that more than makes up for its shortcomings in texture quality. The way the color palettes blend and contrast with the beautiful lighting, along with the sheer grandiosity of The Lands Between, culminate into a remarkable masterpiece.The difficulty is punishing. Let me be clear - I am not a fan of such types of games. But as an RPG and open-world lover, with a penchant for medieval fantasy settings and huge swords, Elden Ring hits every other spot for me.

"F2P game. Ingame Shop that only provides cosmetics. No P2W at all! All these critics regarding the EULA are completely irrelevant and shouldnt be regarded! These conditions are completely normal!Started Phase 2 today. So far the game is quite fun! The game loop seems like this: Discover a new area, complete 1-2 quests, use a certain amount of some stations in cities scattered around the area. In the end you defeat a boss and go to the next area. In the meantime you farm resources and build your base, craft weapons/ armor and slay!Difficulty: So far its not really difficult at all. Difficulty increases by region. To be as strong as before youll have to craft new armor/ weapon. Nothing new here.Cons: It kinda feels like a mobile port. But its not thaaaaaat bad .... Result: A fun game thats actually kinda addicting. Its a kind of a Valheim\Rust survival game but combined with raids and bosses that you know from MMORPGsedit: After a while some more input:I do still recommend the game BUT it has issues! For example- You get warnings, when you click your mouse too fast. So using the furnaces and getting all your stuff out may be more problematic than you might think. - Water Pumps behave VERY weird. - There isnt that much content if you think about it. Every region has like 10 quests in total and maybe 6-8 ""cities"" (towns with 10-40 buildings) to discover. So by now i more or less have done everything for Phase 2 of the Season. And that phase started yesterday! Phase 3 starts next week! - Yes you are gated by phases that disable lots of content to keep you playing for the whole season!- There are bugs! (I was running below the world yesterday, i fell troguh the floor and ran across the void for example) (stopping a craft destroys all already completed materials in my opinion a bug, destroying the crafting building also destroys all materials that were still inside as well)- There are lag issues!- Also even tho its a game with mining, farming and so on in it. There isnt that much you can craft actually. Most things are just improved version of others.- The ""grind"" isnt really grindy ...- Wipes every 6 weeks (wipes are good for these kind of games but 6 weeks may be a bit short for a lot of people)- Most bosses are (so far) simply bullet sponges and easily killed solo. There are exceptions but just because you wont be able to move if you would carry all the ammo you would need to kill that thing!- Its lacking a LOT of QOL features (you can for example drop all items in a chest but cant empty the chest immediately. But have to empty it to destroy it) Thats it so far. I would still recommend it just because its F2P and still fun to play!

"Ok Review Time!!First of all this game is amazing and absolutley a worthy sequel to the first game.I love the direction the game went with its choice of Enemies, The Tyranids have been rarely used outside of the RTS genre and a small splinter fleet of Hive Fleet Leviathan was the Ideal Choice!!Slightly disappointed at first with Chaos (Again) being used as the second antagonist, but quickly changed my mind when it was Revealed that it was the Thousand Sons, which have been criminaly underused in gaming and instead of one of the more ""Safe"" options such as the Black Leigon in the first game!!I also Loved the part where you are Underground on an Imperial Tomb World, which ironicaly enough was a Necron Tomb World, so here's hoping in the Future we get some Necrons (My fave Faction) to fight!!I hope Saber Interactive continues this trend of using underrepresented and overlooked factions and armies into the future!!All of that being said the game is not without some issues, Mainly being how the Dodge and Parry system doesn't work most of the time, there are many times I've pressed the Parry/Dodge button with the prompt/during the indicator window up onscreen and I still got hit, it got so frustrating that i was doing all the steps to not get hit and I get hit and take damage anyway that i simply gave up trying to use the system about halfway through the game.Secondly Melee Combat was at the forefront of the gameplay which left the Shooting aspect of the game to feel quite weak and underpowered in comparison.Third is the customisation of your multiplayer Character, while it seems like Sabre have nailed it it first which they totally have, they have missed some key aspects upon closer inspection. These are quite major things if you think about them and they are as Follows:Bulwark's Banner, for some reason its always the Ultramarines Standard, NOT the Chapter that you want or expect to be representing, example a Salamanders Space Marine Planting down a Ultramarines Standard Flag.This makes zero sense and I want to see this Fixed ASAP as its increadably annoying, especialy when you are a fan of other Chapters.Voice Shouts using the Voice Wheel again suffer from the same exact problem, I dont like the fact that (Insert Chapter's Marine) is shouting out stuff like ""For Guilliman!"" when thats not even there Primearch!!Finally some Chapter Based cosmetics would be really great to have such as Imperial Fists or Blood Angels based wargear with corect Heraldry. Finally ♥♥♥♥ Leandros(Sorry for any Spelling Mistakes, Dyslexia is a ♥♥♥♥♥)BIG EDITNow that I have played the game for a while, I feel the need to add this.Solid game, but in my opinion it has a lot of problems that make it hard to recommend in its current state. I completed the game on Angel of Death (AOD) solo for reference. I played all the operations coop at least once. I played a few rounds of PVP, I won't comment on that since I didn't really enjoy it.The good is that it's a direct continuation of the first. I was happy to see show up in the game in a role that made sense. Overall the lore, environments, and audio were fantastic. The hordes of enemies were impressive and some of the set pieces were neat. Just like the first I loved using the jump jets and thunder hammer to crash down on enemies.There were so many things that combined made this game just not that enjoyable compared to the first for me:The game feels like it was designed for coop first and everything suffers for it. The campaign is filled with generic objectives like hold the location, press these buttons, etc. They don't feel tailor made for campaign experience but a cooperative one. Everything is forced to load to the useless battle barge before you load into an actual mission. This could easily have just been a UI menu.The AI teammates are abysmal. They do not focus on completing objects (ex. defend the chains). The enemies almost entire ignore your allies and routinely rush directly to the player. This is doubly terrible on AODThe game introduces a somewhat more fleshed out dodge and parry system and a kill shot system. In my opinion this is completely out of place. I wasn't looking to play Dark Souls, I'm looking to play a third person shooter. This is doubly bad because the timings on them are so inconsistent. Sometimes you can simply hold the defend button and you will auto parry, others you have to be very precise. The indicator doesn't match the parry timing at all. The kill shot system is also terrible. Both of these share the same problem of parry, dodge, and kill shot not having the ability to be used at any moment in time and interrupting whatever action is currently in progress (ex. a melee attack or shooting). It makes the game feel incredibly clunky and unresponsive on AOD, In general the whole Melee Combat System feels like it was originally designed for a much faster paced combat system which was cut and we then ended up with what we have now.Similar to dodge and kill shot not interrupting all actions, neither does your tactical ability. This is nonsense, that is the whole purpose of the single ability you have for 95% of the campaign, to heal and protect yourself.In general the combat feels like it misses the point of what made the first one great. It should be larger swarms of weaker enemies, not bullet sponge enemies that require dodge/parry/kill shot to do any damageAll of the guns feel too weak. This might be an AOD problem but it feels terrible to have to use 50% of your las rifle to take down one terminator. This is doubly worse because you carry less guns in this game compared to the first.The new health and armor system feels like a step backwards. On AOD you are constantly at 1% HP regardless and there is almost no way to heal yourself through combat like the first game. Everything that touches you will immediately remove your armor so it feels pointless. I would have rather had no armor, more health, and a means to regenerate it through combat (past white damage).You can't queue for a new instance of an operation, it always puts you in one in progress if available. If you are playing for the story, like the campaign suggests, this means you may start at the very end of one if the game decides. When you leave the operation, it forces you to watch the useless scenes in the battle barge over again to return to the campaign which is incredibly annoying.The assault class (the most fun one) is also the most weak one. This is likely a combination of all the above issues though. You cant fly over basic ledges and overhangs, it just feels so weak in operations.I assume most of these issues could be patched for sure and some of them may actually be realistically improved. As it stands though at full price, it's a steep ask for what you get in the package. There is most certainly no longevity to the operations, they are largely static with no variation aside from where/when enemies spawn. PVP is PVP, nothing special. This is a sale game for sure. It does so much right, but the wrong stuff just makes the whole experience feel off.",ok review timefirst game amaz absolutley worthi sequel first gamei love direct game went choic enemi tyranid rare use outsid rt genr small splinter fleet hive fleet leviathan ideal choiceslightli disappoint first chao use second antagonist quickli chang mind reveal thousand son criminali underus game instead one safe option black leigon first gamei also love part underground imperi tomb world ironicali enough necron tomb world here hope futur get necron fave faction fighti hope saber interact continu trend use underrepres overlook faction armi futureal said game without issu mainli dodg parri system doesnt work time mani time ive press parrydodg button promptdur indic window onscreen still got hit got frustrat step get hit get hit take damag anyway simpli gave tri use system halfway gamesecondli mele combat forefront gameplay left shoot aspect game feel quit weak underpow comparisonthird customis multiplay charact seem like sabr nail first total miss key aspect upon closer inspect quit major thing think followsbulwark banner reason alway ultramarin standard chapter want expect repres exampl salamand space marin plant ultramarin standard flagthi make zero sens want see fix asap incread annoy especiali fan chaptersvoic shout use voic wheel suffer exact problem dont like fact insert chapter marin shout stuff like guilliman that even primearchfin chapter base cosmet would realli great imperi fist blood angel base wargear corect heraldri final leandrossorri spell mistak dyslexia big editnow play game feel need add thissolid game opinion lot problem make hard recommend current state complet game angel death aod solo refer play oper coop least play round pvp wont comment sinc didnt realli enjoy itth good direct continu first happi see show game role made sens overal lore environ audio fantast hord enemi impress set piec neat like first love use jump jet thunder hammer crash enemiesther mani thing combin made game enjoy compar first meth game feel like design coop first everyth suffer campaign fill gener object like hold locat press button etc dont feel tailor made campaign experi cooper one everyth forc load useless battl barg load actual mission could easili ui menuth ai teammat abysm focu complet object ex defend chain enemi almost entir ignor alli routin rush directli player doubli terribl aodth game introduc somewhat flesh dodg parri system kill shot system opinion complet place wasnt look play dark soul im look play third person shooter doubli bad time inconsist sometim simpli hold defend button auto parri other precis indic doesnt match parri time kill shot system also terribl share problem parri dodg kill shot abil use moment time interrupt whatev action current progress ex mele attack shoot make game feel incred clunki unrespons aod gener whole mele combat system feel like origin design much faster pace combat system cut end nowsimilar dodg kill shot interrupt action neither tactic abil nonsens whole purpos singl abil campaign heal protect yourselfin gener combat feel like miss point made first one great larger swarm weaker enemi bullet spong enemi requir dodgeparrykil shot damageal gun feel weak might aod problem feel terribl use la rifl take one termin doubli wors carri less gun game compar firstth new health armor system feel like step backward aod constantli hp regardless almost way heal combat like first game everyth touch immedi remov armor feel pointless would rather armor health mean regener combat past white damagey cant queue new instanc oper alway put one progress avail play stori like campaign suggest mean may start end one game decid leav oper forc watch useless scene battl barg return campaign incred annoyingth assault class fun one also weak one like combin issu though cant fli basic ledg overhang feel weak operationsi assum issu could patch sure may actual realist improv stand though full price steep ask get packag certainli longev oper larg static variat asid wherewhen enemi spawn pvp pvp noth special sale game sure much right wrong stuff make whole experi feel

"2022 First of all, in short this is probably the best modern ""Soulsborne"" cinematic universe game we've gotten thus far in PC (Bloodborne when? pls). The addition of certain micro mechanics like jumping, the horse riding (and battles) and now an actual open world that gives you freedom from where to explore to a much higher extent compared to the other games is honestly just great fun. I would not be surprised If the average playtime til completion in Elden ring is at least 2x of the other games and even as an entry into the series it does the job just fine (I do think Dark Souls 3 is a little better as an introduction to the series)BUT, It's been confirmed several times that FromSoftware/Bandai Namco and whoever else is making money from these games. They make A B S O L U T E bank money when they release these games on PC (And If Bloodborne ever got ported to PC that game would also absolutely be bank money). As FromSoftware is literally one of the few Japanese game studios that is so widely recognized and loved in the west I just wish they actually cared about this market as much as *we* love them. Other people that played the game know this, all the reviewers have mentioned this in their YT videos, I have a computer that is quite literally way more powerful than any console running this same game yet I'm getting the stuttering, frame drops. And this entire thing is a reocurring thing with Soulsborne games ported to PC and the kick in the balls is, while this game is absolutely beautiful, it is not the most ""graphically"" challenging game in recent times at all.Should this previous complain deter you from trying out this game? Actually? Absolutely not, I would still recommend it and while I have other minor complains about certain game design things themselves it's still an absolute blast, I'm not even half way through the game yet as for people that are completionists this will really make you want to explore every nook and cranny but this is just a warning and just to get the message out there because I don't know how else you get Bandai/FromSoftware to care about the Steam market that actually makes them drown in money.TL:DR: fort night",first short probabl best modern soulsborn cinemat univers game weve gotten thu far pc bloodborn pl addit certain micro mechan like jump hors ride battl actual open world give freedom explor much higher extent compar game honestli great fun would surpris averag playtim til complet elden ring least game even entri seri job fine think dark soul littl better introduct seriesbut confirm sever time fromsoftwarebandai namco whoever els make money game make b l u e bank money releas game pc bloodborn ever got port pc game would also absolut bank money fromsoftwar liter one japanes game studio wide recogn love west wish actual care market much love peopl play game know review mention yt video comput quit liter way power consol run game yet im get stutter frame drop entir thing reocur thing soulsborn game port pc kick ball game absolut beauti graphic challeng game recent time allshould previou complain deter tri game actual absolut would still recommend minor complain certain game design thing still absolut blast im even half way game yet peopl completionist realli make want explor everi nook cranni warn get messag dont know els get bandaifromsoftwar care steam market actual make drown moneytldr fort night

"It's not a game that can be in the top 10 ofc, BUT it's a very good example that you don't need a triple A game to have a good time, this is my first review on steam i think even tho i have over 20 games here and i've played hundreds of games on them. So far: 1) Combat techniques are smooth and fun.2) Tutorials are very clear and easy to follow.3) Storytelling is really engaging.4) Tasks and quests are not progressive, so you won't progress in the game very fast and it's not very slow either.5) Visuals are wonderful for sure!6) Character customisation is not overwhelming like in other games.7) Inventory and quick actions (HUD) settings are very good and give you an amazing gaming experience.Maybe i'll update the review when i come across more things.Wonderful game!

"Game is great. You won't find a negative review revolving around the actual game, just people shocked that a video game has a terms of service agreement. It's genuinely pathetic how people play for 10 minutes, and feel compelled to soy out over TOS or crashes in a steam review so they can roleplay as some kind of bastion of consumer protection because they're too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid and hollow to do anything else with their 7 braincells. The game crashed once at launch during a cutscene and hasn't crashed again since. The only valid complaint is the lack of an FOV slider, which is odd, but also likely to be patched in later.

"Nobody will read my review, so I'll just say ♥♥♥♥ anyone who starts their comment like that (except me). This game deserves way better than cheap, lazy spam. I’ve 100% completed Elden Ring on PS5, got the platinum trophy which was an absolute blast, and now I’m diving into it on PC. FromSoftware, you’ve seriously outdone yourselves. Elden Ring is nothing short of phenomenal, and it's hard to imagine how you'll ever top this.From the moment I stepped into this vast, mysterious world, I was hooked. The blend of deep lore, challenging combat, and stunning landscapes is just incredible. The gameplay is smoth and perfectly balanced, making every fight feel like a rewarding test of skill.Exploring the world of Elden Ring is pure joy. It's packed with secrets, hidden paths, and lore that keeps you wanting more. The environmental storyteling is so rich that every corner of the map feels worth investigating. Each region has its own uniqie look and feel, so exploration never gets boring.Now, let’s talk about the only thing that annoys me: the catacombs or dungeons. This has been a problem since Bloodborne (my favorite game of all time). Even though Elden Ring does it better than Bloodborne, every dungeon still feels a bit like an AI-generated copy-paste job. But hey, they’re still fun.The character builds you can create in Elden Ring are better than in any Souls game before it. Whether you’re into melee combat, magic, or a mix of both, the depth here is just amazing.In short, Elden Ring isn’t just a game; it’s an experience. FromSoftware has set a new standard for the genre and maybe created a new genre, and I can’t wait to see what they do with the DLC. If you haven’t played it yet, do yourself a favor and dive in. You won’t regret it.",nobodi read review ill say anyon start comment like except game deserv way better cheap lazi spam ive complet elden ring got platinum trophi absolut blast im dive pc fromsoftwar youv serious outdon elden ring noth short phenomen hard imagin youll ever top thisfrom moment step vast mysteri world hook blend deep lore challeng combat stun landscap incred gameplay smoth perfectli balanc make everi fight feel like reward test skillexplor world elden ring pure joy pack secret hidden path lore keep want environment storytel rich everi corner map feel worth investig region uniqi look feel explor never get boringnow let talk thing annoy catacomb dungeon problem sinc bloodborn favorit game time even though elden ring better bloodborn everi dungeon still feel bit like aigener copypast job hey theyr still funth charact build creat elden ring better soul game whether your mele combat magic mix depth amazingin short elden ring isnt game experi fromsoftwar set new standard genr mayb creat new genr cant wait see dlc havent play yet favor dive wont regret
"It's pains me to say this as a huge warhammer fan but I overall found my experience with this game to be less than superb and not worth the money.For a high triple-A price tag it has far too many bugs, connection issues and sloppy optimisation that weigh down a game that, whilst isn't bad, doesn't feel like it does anything too spectacular. Combat feels very stiff and cagey where you transition awkwardly from spamming melee moves and swinging wildly around the place to firing off one or two mags of your current weapon (before it ultimately runs out of ammunition because of the ridiculously low amount of ammo the player is allowed to retain). There isn't anywhere near enough variety in execution animations, and enemy variety is sorely lacking. The single player campaign is just ""good enough""; It has some cool standout moments but it's mostly bogged down with lots of sub par segments and bickering between squadmates that gets tiring to listen to very quickly. Titus feels very watered down and flat in this game, and most of the supporting cast of characters don't stand out too much save for a handful. Operations CAN be good...When it's working and you can connect to a game, which is a struggle to achieve at the best of times. The PvP multiplayer is laughably unoptimised and has some of the worst ping issues I've played in a multiplayer game in years (a massive shame as I was a huge fan of the first Space Marine game's multiplayer which had better ping and servers almost a full decade ago) as well as a veritable host of balance issues with classes and a score limit for matches that's far too short for how long it takes to get into the match in the first place. All of these modes, unfortunately, also have the misfortune of being tied within a very obtuse and sluggish overworld/hub interface. If you want to customise your characters for the multiplayer modes it requires you to matchmake in those modes, which 9/10 times usually leads to you getting into a game before you can even customise your classes or loadout and forcing you to sit through several load screens (that is if you actually ever load INTO whatever you matchmaked for with how bad the connection issues are.) before you can so much as determine what colour you want your space marine to be or what weapon you want them to use. The hub exists to be a diegetic and seamless way for players to experience the game but it manages to do the complete opposite since it brings with it a whole host of problems that ultimately ruin the immersion of the hub in the first place.I really want to like this game but in truth I've derived no joy from playing it to completion, and I feel no motivation trying to finish up the last 3 operations when the game is fighting me at every opportunity to stop me from getting to do so and is just wasting my time seemingly out of spite. At a FAR cheaper price tag and with some tuning up, I could definitely recommend this game, but in it's current state and with all it's baggage and pricing, I'd advise steering clear of this one for now. You'll get more fun out of playing some of the other equally, poorly optimised 40k games that at least don't take too much of your cash.",pain say huge warhamm fan overal found experi game less superb worth moneyfor high triplea price tag far mani bug connect issu sloppi optimis weigh game whilst isnt bad doesnt feel like anyth spectacular combat feel stiff cagey transit awkwardli spam mele move swing wildli around place fire one two mag current weapon ultim run ammunit ridicul low amount ammo player allow retain isnt anywher near enough varieti execut anim enemi varieti sore lack singl player campaign good enough cool standout moment mostli bog lot sub par segment bicker squadmat get tire listen quickli titu feel water flat game support cast charact dont stand much save hand oper goodwhen work connect game struggl achiev best time pvp multiplay laughabl unoptimis worst ping issu ive play multiplay game year massiv shame huge fan first space marin game multiplay better ping server almost full decad ago well verit host balanc issu class score limit match that far short long take get match first place mode unfortun also misfortun tie within obtus sluggish overworldhub interfac want customis charact multiplay mode requir matchmak mode time usual lead get game even customis class loadout forc sit sever load screen actual ever load whatev matchmak bad connect issu much determin colour want space marin weapon want use hub exist dieget seamless way player experi game manag complet opposit sinc bring whole host problem ultim ruin immers hub first placei realli want like game truth ive deriv joy play complet feel motiv tri finish last oper game fight everi opportun stop get wast time seemingli spite far cheaper price tag tune could definit recommend game current state baggag price id advis steer clear one youll get fun play equal poorli optimis game least dont take much cash

"2022 'Posted: 20 Feb @ 4:02amIncredible gameBuggy at the minute but still worth the purchasecba making a full on review, if u like total war grab it if u have the money idk im not ur dad'I made this review when I was off the first high of finishing a Legendary Slaanesh campaign. I love it, it was fun. I can't say that I still feel the same way. Patching and fixes for this games many problems is abysmally slow. I don't agree with simply calling the game trash and moving on because the actual races, maps, etc. Are all pretty cool, but they just do not play well at all.Infantry is hardly responsive and pushes you to doomstack monsters even moreso than Warhammer two already didTowers are frankly broken and most siege battles are unloseable chores due to god awful AI, in my last run I played pretty much every defense in triple speed waiting for the enemy to die on my tier 2 ♥♥♥♥ infantry as towers bricked them.AI rebuild siege defenses with basically no delay. As soon as you destroy a tower they start rebuilding it. Fighting minor siege battles is legitimately unfun, there are fewer land battles on the map which is where this franchise truly shines.There are a lot of really, really bad performance and visual issues which people experience at different levels. Some people have mid-tier rigs and are completely fine, others are super high end and get abysmal performance on the campaign map.The soul-run campaign just isn't fun. An overwhelming majority of the community would probably agree to this. It is a linear experience of expand, consolidate, expand. Turtle, turtle, turtle. Rifts are cancer and your legendary lord spends the majority of his/her time in either the Realms of Chaos or sitting in favoured corruption settlements to get rid of cancerous corurption traits like -5% replenishment which can severely hamstring certain factions. In my Slaanesh run I had a Keeper of Secrets with this trait and he was literally unable to replenish outside of tier 5 settlements. ♥♥♥♥ game design. The narrative isn't that interesting because its very impersonal, whereas Vortex' story felt very personal to your faction despite the overall plot being the exact same. Supply lines lmaoThis game has potential but I've recently uninstalled it. It just isn't fun, it hardly works. Its difficult enough to get through a campaign even ignoring the absolute tide of bugs that this game has.CA is still displaying a trend of poor management post launch and frank disrespect for their games. Again, this is a good game. Its in a broken state, so I can't recommend that anybody buy it atm.I sincerely hope that I'll be changing this review in a few patches.

"2022 Game is solid.UPDATE: 2/24/2022HOWEVER,if you are on the fence about buying the game, I'd wait. This game has good bones, and will certainly be a masterpiece in a few years. Once Immortal Empires is released and there have been several updates, it'll be a thoroughly enjoyable experience.In my first co-op campaign, my graphics card failed 5 times. Screen went black, then eventually came back but with black boxes and half the colors gone. This has not happened in any other game, including Total Warhammer II. My graphics card is struggling far more than it should be, and that's on a 1080Ti with settings at medium-high. Simply put, something is wrong here. I don't know if it's the rumored Denuvo, or if there is more optimization that needs to be done. I even have the Nvidia drivers that were designed with this games release in mind.Gameplay wise, it's great. The few nitpicks I do have, I'm sure will be ironed out in the patches to come. Warhammer II had many issues on launch as well, and now that game is very refined and enjoyable. I'm very confident that game 3 will also receive the love and attention it deserves, but it will take time.I look forward to the future of this game with updates, DLC, and mods. It's enjoyable now, but the Ideal Total War: Warhammer 3 experience is probably a year out from now.Regardless of whether you have the game now or are choosing to wait, I hope you enjoy the games you are playing, cheers!",game solidupd fenc buy game id wait game good bone certainli masterpiec year immort empir releas sever updat itll thoroughli enjoy experiencein first coop campaign graphic card fail time screen went black eventu came back black box half color gone happen game includ total warhamm ii graphic card struggl far that set mediumhigh simpli put someth wrong dont know rumor denuvo optim need done even nvidia driver design game releas mindgameplay wise great nitpick im sure iron patch come warhamm ii mani issu launch well game refin enjoy im confid game also receiv love attent deserv take timei look forward futur game updat dlc mod enjoy ideal total war warhamm experi probabl year nowregardless whether game choos wait hope enjoy game play cheer

"Product refunded Space Marine 2 feels like playing a classic AA Xbox game, one that you'd rent from the local Redbox for a week and try to finish in a few sittings. A game that feels catered to rental services, but not worth a full $60 purchase. In one way, I found my playtime oddly nostalgic and charming for the aforementioned reasons, but in another way, I found myself totally uninspired, questioning why I had just spent $60 for a game that, despite its great visuals, felt oddly antiquated. Ultimately, there just isn't a lot of depth here - I don't need games to be complicated, but this one felt sorta mind-numbing at times. Hoard-combat sounds like so much fun in theory, but often has a similar sensation to mowing the lawn: an exercise in patience, as you direct your big mowing machine towards the next patch of unkempt grass, once you're there, there isn't much 'strategy' involved - it's just grass. That being said, the graphics are great. I wish it had ultrawide support, and I'm not sure what about this package requires them to take a month post-launch to officially add it. The environments and hoards look particularly amazing - the lighting can also look incredible under the correct circumstances - it's then a shame that the first 2 hours of this game are set almost entirely on a beige planet filled with swamp-fog and mud. Speaking of hours - I know this campaign is only 6 or so hours long. This isn't an issue in principle if the package is really condensed and well-made, but Space Marine 2 is just so damn average that it becomes a much harder pill to swallow. I personally have no interest in online game modes, so for me: someone seeking a strong single-player campaign the likes of Halo 3, Reach, Wolfenstien, Doom 2016, etc, .. I am left comparably underwhelmed. There isn't enough here for me to sink my teeth into. It's a $60 game that feels as though it's resting a bit too much on its graphical laurels to justify an amateur game experience. Shallow combat and an aggressively short campaign emphasizes the mediocrity of the package, and even if it wasn't true for everyone, it was true for me. The draw of the 40k universe isn't endearing enough for me to overlook the inadequacies of this experience.",product refund space marin feel like play classic aa xbox game one youd rent local redbox week tri finish sit game feel cater rental servic worth full purchas one way found playtim oddli nostalg charm aforement reason anoth way found total uninspir question spent game despit great visual felt oddli antiqu ultim isnt lot depth dont need game complic one felt sorta mindnumb time hoardcombat sound like much fun theori often similar sensat mow lawn exercis patienc direct big mow machin toward next patch unkempt grass your isnt much strategi involv grass said graphic great wish ultrawid support im sure packag requir take month postlaunch offici add environ hoard look particularli amaz light also look incred correct circumst shame first hour game set almost entir beig planet fill swampfog mud speak hour know campaign hour long isnt issu principl packag realli condens wellmad space marin damn averag becom much harder pill swallow person interest onlin game mode someon seek strong singleplay campaign like halo reach wolfenstien doom etc left compar underwhelm isnt enough sink teeth game feel though rest bit much graphic laurel justifi amateur game experi shallow combat aggress short campaign emphas mediocr packag even wasnt true everyon true draw univers isnt endear enough overlook inadequaci experi

"Take this with a grain of salt. I ultimately refunded it because of various small issues.1. Performance while stable felt bad on my 3080. DLSS turned on by default with no way to turn it off... not a good look and many other games have had drama just for this, games shouldn't need DLSS to function. (Examples: Remnant 2, Cyberpunk2077). I can't play this game with DLSS forced on, with optimized settings (a combo of mid-very high settings) and RT off at mid to high settings. This gets me around 70-75 fps at 1080p around 65-70 at 1440p. I spent $3000+ on a gaming computer last year to play games at max settings, and high frame rates. Watching 2023-24 games come out and turn a $3000 pc into something thats comparible to a console is just sad.2. Difficulty had weird spike you either beat everything down pretty easy or you get pooped on. In the two hours I made it to the area with the first official fire boss with a side boss (big headed blue guy) couldn't beat either in the time I had with the game. The combat is action based but I HATE that I can't dodge out of an attack. I can't tell you how many times I would attack the game ques the attack but even if I see something coming I can't dodge out of the way instead stuck in an attack animation, speaking of heavy attacks feel weird as I try to implement them into my light attacks but without a ""focus bead"" you can't string a heavy into your combo and instead have to come to a stand still before you can ques up a heavy attack. Combat feels both clunky and fluid at the same time with difficulty spikes in both directions as well.3. This was the deciding factor: Time... unfortunately because games have a 2 hour limit before they can't be refunded I take that time seriously as $60+ investment isn't so small in 2024 with costs rising. From the time I hit ""play"" Steam's timer keeps track of shaders compiling (about 5-10 minutes), and then me looking at options (mostly graphics) and bench marking for optimized settings took another 20-30 minutes before I even hit ""new game"". There I am already 45-ish minutes into a game I have yet to truly try. I fortunately watched a couple people start it up and was able to skip the opening cinematic and a couple cut scenes saving me valuable time and still left me in the starting area as my 2 hour limit came along.Unfortunately because of the time constants and the few little issues I had I can't say for certain whether this game is good or not but it's issues were enough to make me refund it. I wasn't going to lose out on money for a game I wasn't crazy about. I think we need to talk about opening up the refund window on games that boast dozens of hours of content and only having 2 hours to demo that content. I truly believe if I had another 2-3 hours I might have found something to love but as is I couldn't bring myself to spend $60 for a game I was meh about with the 1 hour 15-ish minutes I had with it.",take grain salt ultim refund variou small perform stabl felt bad dlss turn default way turn good look mani game drama game shouldnt need dlss function exampl remnant cant play game dlss forc optim set combo midveri high set rt mid high set get around fp around spent game comput last year play game max set high frame rate watch game come turn pc someth that compar consol difficulti weird spike either beat everyth pretti easi get poop two hour made area first offici fire boss side boss big head blue guy couldnt beat either time game combat action base hate cant dodg attack cant tell mani time would attack game que attack even see someth come cant dodg way instead stuck attack anim speak heavi attack feel weird tri implement light attack without focu bead cant string heavi combo instead come stand still que heavi attack combat feel clunki fluid time difficulti spike direct decid factor time unfortun game hour limit cant refund take time serious invest isnt small cost rise time hit play steam timer keep track shader compil minut look option mostli graphic bench mark optim set took anoth minut even hit new game alreadi minut game yet truli tri fortun watch coupl peopl start abl skip open cinemat coupl cut scene save valuabl time still left start area hour limit came alongunfortun time constant littl issu cant say certain whether game good issu enough make refund wasnt go lose money game wasnt crazi think need talk open refund window game boast dozen hour content hour demo content truli believ anoth hour might found someth love couldnt bring spend game meh hour minut

For a single play through this is a great game but for a sandbox strategy game you really want to enjoy it more than once.

Provided you like the general 'soulslike' approach and setting, this game is a wonderful step forward and truly takes the whole thing into an open world. There is so much to explore, to uncover, to find... and to get pounded into the floor.If you are absolutely new to From Software's approach on difficulty and gameplay, then Elden Ring is the most userfriendly one. A really slow paced tutorial (compared to: this is how you move... YOU DIED.) so even newcomers have can get accustomed to the core mechanics.But don't get me wrong: the difficulty spikes are still there, and you WILL DIE A LOT! But this is actually part of how these games work, so do not falter when your health runs out yet again.It is really hard to write a lot about it, without spoiling anything.

"2022 As you've probably noticed, some people have really enjoyed this game and others have not. I fall into the category of one who doesn't mind the Realm of Chaos campaign that many others despise. Yes, at times it can be annoying, but as someone who has plays the Vortex campaign in Total War Warhammer 2, I'm quite used to this type of campaign and don't need to wait for Immortal Empires to come out.Some pros to the game:- Decent Faction Selection (base game has 9 Legendary Lords from 7 different factions).- Map is very large and allows for diversity in what enemies and friends you come across.- Individual Faction Mechanics for every faction that adds some flavor to each one.- Skarbrand the Exiled punting most characters across the map.- Graphics are pretty good especially on higher settings.- Modding Community is wonderful.Cons:- Immortal Empires isn't out yet. Less sandbox-ish for now as you are kind of forced into playing the Souls Race unless you have a mod that turns it off.- Limited Units as of now for each faction, especially the Daemonic factions.- Cannot play as the Warhammer one and two races. This doesn't faze me, but I know it affects a lot of people that fancy playing the Empire for the 50th time.- Anti-Player Bias still is strong, but much better than what it was at release back in February of 2022.Conclusion:Personally, I think the game is worth it and it is only going to get better as we progress further into the year. If you are waiting for Immortal Empires, then I would hold off until later this year when the beta gets set up for that. If you really want to try out new factions like Cathay (which is new-ish to lore) and the Daemons, then I would recommend getting this game.

Thankfully no bugs with that, but maybe they'll release some $5 DLC that lets you drop the f-bomb every 20 posts. TWW3 is a fine game on its own, delivers everything you might want, but the recent DLC with that price tag has been quite disappointed.

"2023 I've bought every DLC from WH1 to WH3, with the exception of your newest 25$ DLC pack.For that price I'd expect a new, fully fleshed out faction. What do we get? 3 Legendary Lords and a unit roster that does very little to pad out the existing races you chose to feature in that DLC pack. You lot must be really getting ribbed hard by your investors to destroy all the good faith you've built with your community these long, long years. I waited patiently for WH3. I waited patiently for the DLCs to release -- because I thought it would get to a standard that would match WH2. I was wrong.Warhammer 3 was supposed to be your magnum opus. The king of kings. CA, you can still fix this. Your management just need to pull their heads out of your investor's buttholes and actually support your developers on this project. Help them help you. If you lot screw this game up more than you have, there will be no relevancy left for you. You think anyone will buy anything from you goobers again if you let this beautiful idea fail from mismanagement? Respect our time, respect our money. Inflation has hit everyone. Products are shrinking in size everywhere, prices are going up across the board. I refuse to believe inflation has hit a game company as hard as it has the rest of us. Maybe in your bottom line in the fact you actually have to pay your employees, CA. But I doubt they hardly see any of the benefits of your increased prices, hence - I don't give a damn about any PR speech related to your hardships. Your workers don't get any extra pay, only your crappy management do. I bet your management aren't even game developers. I bet they're just scum sucking bean counters who wormed their way up in the game industry through their sales experience. Guess what, people want a good game. Just give them one and they'll pay. These bad reviews aren't just because of your awful, awful DLC. The game itself is not in a good state. Promises that were made have been under-delivered. There has been an extremely long gap between DLC and updates. People have expectations, hopes - and those two things can only be betrayed so many times.Then you give them Shadows of Change? More like Shadows of the Underwhelmed. There's only one way to teach a bean counter how to invest in a good game. Make bad game. Numbers go down. No need for any of us to invest our time and money in disappointment.Make a good game, numbers go up. I know investors are like children in that they're used to instant gratification. But maybe they can learn how to wait like the rest of us are forced to? At least they wont be disappointed by the cold hard cash you dummies will make if you actually pull WH3 off right. It'll take time. Just show the community good faith, transparency and a willingness to veer back onto the right track. Prices to match the content provided, bullcrap about 'inflation' aside. 3 LLs and some units meant to slightly pad out some base game faction niches? 14.99$.Hey you know what I'll even be generous and offer some solutions, it'll make your desk jockeys heads spin.Change your Shadows of Change DLC to 14.99$ and offer those who've bought the DLC a discount on the next content pack you decide to release, equal to the 10$ they have lost. I mean, it's practically ensuring returning customers!!! If you can't do that? Offer them all exclusive beta access to your next content pack for testing/enjoyment. Wow, a band-aid and it's practically free. All you'd have to do after that is fix/tweak what's already there in between your DLC projects.

"Now that we know what is going to be wiped each season, (every 6 weeks) this game is basically ruined for me. I can not sweatlord my way through from the very beginning and grind out memetic progression, world progression, and unlocks every 6 weeks. I get that they want to set a level playing field around the PVP part of the game, but how are people that have other responsibilities like family / work supposed to ever get anywhere when you require a restart from a fresh character every 6 weeks. If the season wipes are changed to not sh*t on our time spent exploring and unlocking new areas of the map, and character progression isn't completely wiped, I would recommend this game with 2 thumbs up, having been in every closed playtest since the first one. This game has so much to offer and can be absolutely incredible to experience, but they are absolutely ruining it for what I suspect will be a sizable portion of the would-be player base with the season wipe stance they are taking. Hopefully they are open to changing things, because this game went from a 9/10 to a 2/10 for me. I was actually going to dump about $50 into the game at launch just to support them bc of the play tests and I expected it would be a great game to support, but I will unfortunately be holding off to see if they come up with a better system for seasons. Some people are fine with these types of seasons/wipes, and that's fine, but I don't have the time to get reset like that over and over.",know go wipe season everi week game basic ruin sweatlord way begin grind memet progress world progress unlock everi week get want set level play field around pvp part game peopl respons like famili work suppos ever get anywher requir restart fresh charact everi week season wipe chang sht time spent explor unlock new area map charact progress isnt complet wipe would recommend game thumb everi close playtest sinc first one game much offer absolut incred experi absolut ruin suspect sizabl portion wouldb player base season wipe stanc take hope open chang thing game went actual go dump game launch support bc play test expect would great game support unfortun hold see come better system season peopl fine type seasonswip that fine dont time get reset like

"2022 Elden Ring is a good game but unfortunately it's very poorly optimized.I kinda dismissed the other reviews saying how bad the frame drops are thinking they're exaggerated but I experienced them myself throughout the whole game.I'm not sure whether it's just bad optimization or because of the Easy Anti-Cheat but the frames stutter constantly, some areas more than others but it's just something you have to deal with through the game.This is also something I heard from pretty much everyone I talked to, this is not an issue of hardware (RTX 2070 and Ryzen 2700X)Elden Ring takes a lot from FromSoft's older titles and improves on most of them.The game is way more accessible with a LOT of ways to make the experience easier and also some very welcome quality of life changes, which I hope they will continue with and expand on future titles.Being an open world has it's draws though as if you're a fan of Dark Souls' old world design then you're not really gonna find that here.Another thing to note is that there is some cut content that's still half in the game and while it's not much, you do notice something's off, as well as a few bugs here and there.Online play is terrible, in coop and especially invasions you're gonna have a bad time. If you even manage to connect, and stay connected throughout the whole thing.One time I even got an ""Inappropriate activity detected"" error and was booted to the menu unable to go online.This probably was caused by some sort of false positive in Easy Anti-Cheat as I understand it happened to many people during that time and was later fixed but still an unpleasant experience.As much as I like FromSoft I expect better from a Triple A product.",elden ring good game unfortun poorli optimizedi kinda dismiss review say bad frame drop think theyr exagger experienc throughout whole gameim sure whether bad optim easi anticheat frame stutter constantli area other someth deal gamethi also someth heard pretti much everyon talk issu hardwar rtx ryzen ring take lot fromsoft older titl improv themth game way access lot way make experi easier also welcom qualiti life chang hope continu expand futur titlesb open world draw though your fan dark soul old world design your realli gon na find hereanoth thing note cut content that still half game much notic someth well bug thereonlin play terribl coop especi invas your gon na bad time even manag connect stay connect throughout whole thingon time even got inappropri activ detect error boot menu unabl go onlinethi probabl caus sort fals posit easi anticheat understand happen mani peopl time later fix still unpleas experiencea much like fromsoft expect better tripl product

"2023 Absolutely insulting and disgusting pricing policy by CA for their latest DLC. But, that in and of itself shouldn't be a problem for the base game, right? So why is the review negative?Simple, CA has effectively abandoned this game for the last year. They worked half-heartedly at fixing the most glaring issues but have, time and time again, utterly failed to keep their words on bug fixes, blatantly lied about maintaining a sufficient number of devs working on this project, tried to pacify the community by releasing roadmaps they have no intention (or ability) to follow, and overall left the game in a lacking state. Just to mention one among the countless issues, is absolutely unacceptable that people who PAID to buy the Nakai DLC (not me btw) cannot recruit Kroxigors, you know, the SINGLE UNIT HE'S SUPPOSED TO USE THE MOST. To call that embarrassing would be an understatement.CA has worked hard to destroy any remaining goodwill they had left after the disastrous launch of this game, and absolutely deserves to get what's coming to them, including but not limited to, low sales and abysmal player retention. Hopefully, the community's effort will make them understand that a change of attitude towards this game is in order. Personally though, I hold little hope.The total war community desperately needs a competitor to bust into the scene and light a fire under CA's sorry buttocks.",absolut insult disgust price polici ca latest dlc shouldnt problem base game right review negativesimpl ca effect abandon game last year work halfheartedli fix glare issu time time utterli fail keep word bug fix blatantli lie maintain suffici number dev work project tri pacifi commun releas roadmap intent abil follow overal left game lack state mention one among countless issu absolut unaccept peopl paid buy nakai dlc btw recruit kroxigor know singl unit he suppos use call embarrass would understatementca work hard destroy remain goodwil left disastr launch game absolut deserv get what come includ limit low sale abysm player retent hope commun effort make understand chang attitud toward game order person though hold littl hopeth total war commun desper need competitor bust scene light fire ca sorri buttock

"The game is indeed beautiful, and the controls are pretty easy to pick up. But man is this monkey weak! It takes a dozen hits from his rather heavy looking staff to take out trash mobs, who can kill you pretty easily with just a few hits. I've not made it out of the first mountain, but so far this is not open world; you are confined to a narrow corridor. And for the bosses, the game is basically grind trash in this hallway until you level up to beat one boss, and repeat this cycle forever. ""Temples, towns, and shops"" have been replaced with a one stop do everything shrine system, and there's zero exploration. I guess this is China's answer to Elden Ring, except not open world. For the kind of people who like that sort of thing, that's the sort of thing that kind of people like.

"2023 I have bought every xpac but SoC. I have earned the idiot crown I wear, and the right to speak on this game and the franchise's history - since I saw it happen. Way back when TW: WH1 was released, I was hesitantly critical of some things. The usual microtransaction stuff I figured was gross but mildly tolerable for a game I enjoyed. Locking units behind pre-orders? Less tolerable. Units basically just swinging swords at one another, nothing ever connecting? Oh.. Not like I liked to zoom in and watch the lads fight or anything.. (/s) No real incentive to play multiplayer except some momentary fun? I still think a currency from MP battles which can eventually be used to buy factions which I suggested all those years ago could have saved us from this timeline. Now I hear the team in charge of fixing the game was so so small, and the cuts to the workforce reaching like 40%. Where did the money even go then? And saying things like ""the right to discuss is a privilege"" and banning content creators who are justifiably upset? Yikes.This should be a lesson to all dev studios. When you strike gold with something like Total War, treat it like what it is: art. Pour yourself into it, and make it something you're proud of.If you treat it like a business, your product will rot and you'll be left with a brand that leaves a bitter taste in fans' mouths. Of course I'm sure the ones making all the bad decisions will receive their golden parachutes, and go on ruining other projects. But this franchise could have been something incredible if it had been done right.Thanks for everything, Creative Arts. It was.. enlightening. Enjoy the hundreds (thousands?)

"2023 Update April 2024 I decided to change my recommendation to positive in view of recent news regarding layoffs at CA, the rampant rumors around Total War: Warhammer III being scaled down from what was originally planned, and lastly because the additions to Shadows of Change were pretty good. Despite the fact that multiplayer campaigns barely function, despite the random CTD's, units having seriously bad pathfinding around gates and ladders, Warriors of Chaos and Cathay tech not working properly, or that there are heroes with not enough skills to put their skill points into, I still love this game. A lot of that love lies in thanks to the modding community, but the love and work that CA the Warhammer team have put into it is undeniable.Finally, a message to SEGA. Do not let this game die before it gets a chance to redeem itself The whole reason we're here is due to CA leadership being incompetent, out of touch, greedy dirtbagsPunish them, not the game that makes money despite their best efforts to gun it down while it's laying the golden eggs. Update Feb 2024Since I posted this review, CA made a public statement ""apologizing"" (quotes because the wording of the apology was very corporate and didn't really make the point of owning up to mistakes) but also promising to be better. In this vein, they cut the price of Total War: Pharaoh, refunded all owners, and promised to add content to Shadows of Change to match the asking price. This all happened in late December. They are currently coming out with a series of blog posts detailing the added units/lords/heroes in every race (at the time of writing this, only Cathay and Tzeentch are out) and the update is due next week. However, I will not be changing my recommendation yet, as this whole ordeal has been going on since the game was released. I'd like to have them be consistently good for a good long while before I can honestly recommend the game. Plus, it's still riddled with bugs. Original Review in November I'm sorry, as many hours of entertainment this game, which I truly love, has given me, I cannot in good conscience recommend it. Unfortunately, Creative Assembly have been treating it as a money maker that will always make money no matter what, essentially abandoning it in the process. Their idea of ""support"" is to let a haggard, poor dlc team of, I would wager, less than twenty people to maintain, patch, AND produce content, while at the same time increasing prices to absurd amounts for lesser quality content than for every other dlc ever. In the meantime, as the team is stretched super thin, glaring problems (which the community has addressed in mere days via mods) have been left in the game for months at a time. Imagine buying a faction dlc focused on a specific unit, and that faction being completely unable to recruit said unit FOR THREE ENTIRE MONTHS.And to top things off, they came out with a statement as a response to community backlash for the latest price increase, basically saying ""we want more money, buy the dlc or we drop support entirely"" Tldr: CA have abandoned this game. QA is non-existent, major bugs are in the game for months on end, and CA came out with an ultimatum to buy the dlc at an absurd price or they'll drop support.",updat april decid chang recommend posit view recent news regard layoff ca rampant rumor around total war warhamm iii scale origin plan lastli addit shadow chang pretti good despit fact multiplay campaign bare function despit random ctd unit serious bad pathfind around gate ladder warrior chao cathay tech work properli hero enough skill put skill point still love game lot love lie thank mod commun love work ca warhamm team put undeniablefin messag sega let game die get chanc redeem whole reason due ca leadership incompet touch greedi dirtbagspunish game make money despit best effort gun lay golden egg updat feb post review ca made public statement apolog quot word apolog corpor didnt realli make point own mistak also promis better vein cut price total war pharaoh refund owner promis add content shadow chang match ask price happen late decemb current come seri blog post detail ad unitslordshero everi race time write cathay tzeentch updat due next week howev chang recommend yet whole ordeal go sinc game releas id like consist good good long honestli recommend game plu still riddl bug origin review novemb im sorri mani hour entertain game truli love given good conscienc recommend unfortun creativ assembl treat money maker alway make money matter essenti abandon process idea support let haggard poor dlc team would wager less twenti peopl maintain patch produc content time increas price absurd amount lesser qualiti content everi dlc ever meantim team stretch super thin glare problem commun address mere day via mod left game month time imagin buy faction dlc focus specif unit faction complet unabl recruit said unit three entir monthsand top thing came statement respons commun backlash latest price increas basic say want money buy dlc drop support entir tldr ca abandon game qa nonexist major bug game month end ca came ultimatum buy dlc absurd price theyll drop support

"2023 I've updated my review to reflect the good work CA have made over the last few patches. You can no longer win a siege by sneaking in some units via the backdoor, you are no longer required to defend 2 completely different areas of the base in order to successfully repel a siege.There is still a massive issue with AI being far too passive, they no longer build massive empires. The AI no longer confederates (even the Empire rarely seems to confederate their elector counts) which prevents any factions becoming powerful. This might be ok for lower difficulties but Legendary players need more of a challenge. I also can't say how much I despise them making all minor factions just free wins for the AI. The glorious re-playability of WH2 was finding out who survived to the mid/end game. Now it's the same factions every single playthrough as they removed the ability for minor factions to sometimes get the upper hand on their larger rivals. Finding Marienburg had wiped out the Empire or Mousillon had conquered Bretonnia was the joy of starting a new campaign. There's none of that now, bring back aggressive AI empires and none whipping boy minor factions and you've restored my faith.",ive updat review reflect good work ca made last patch longer win sieg sneak unit via backdoor longer requir defend complet differ area base order success repel siegether still massiv issu ai far passiv longer build massiv empir ai longer confeder even empir rare seem confeder elector count prevent faction becom power might ok lower difficulti legendari player need challeng also cant say much despis make minor faction free win ai gloriou replay find surviv midend game faction everi singl playthrough remov abil minor faction sometim get upper hand larger rival find marienburg wipe empir mousillon conquer bretonnia joy start new campaign there none bring back aggress ai empir none whip boy minor faction youv restor faith

"2022 New factions are fine addition to Total War Warhammer, however the campaign itself is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Game really discourages you from fighting the other factions and expanding. Also realm of Tzeentch is the worst ♥♥♥♥ they came up with. AI straight up cheats and walk to the end. If you follow the same path and go to the same portals, they throw you to different locations. Also somehow they made sieges even worse now. I don't think it's a good idea that you can build towers etc in middle of the battle. I think they should only be done in battle preparation phase. Guess I just have to resort to autoresolve the siege battles. At least they made Military Alliances somewhat useful now as you can build outposts and recruit units from your allies so that's cool I guess. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Man, I really dig the new update. Added late game encounters is really darn pog system which i'm looking forward to. However it still baffles me that siege battles remained the same, they're the worst dogshite they came up with. Whether it's ""unlimited"" tower ranges or being able to build towers mid combat, that's just ♥♥♥♥ game design imo. I played as Volkmar and generally loved the campaign. I just wish it was easier to get special units from elector counts. When I unlocked 4 books out of 8, the late game event usually starts at that time, and elector count units practically become ""obsolete"" or come in way too late to make any difference in campaign. + It takes way too long to recruit more of them. I wish you could recruit them through military alliances maybe?

"2023 Hundreds of hours and almost every single DLC purchased at full price since TW:WH 1. I'd love it if I could convince my friends to play. Lately I wouldn't want to, even if I could. Responding to the community with patronizing language and blaming increased costs (without acknowledging those costs certainly aren't going toward THIS game's future), with a track record of abandoning games and broken promises to the playerbase is a great reason for CA leadership to change career paths. Senior executives really don't have that much meaningful good they can do, but they sure can do some damage. Give your dev team more money and time. Stop plucking the golden goose.For a deeper dive: DLC as of writing this tops out at $260. That alone should make anyone new to the franchise wince. A new person would be playing pared down, outright incomplete, or unbalanced versions of a very small percentage of the total game. Mods would help, some. But CA doesn't pay modders.Further Problems I have recommending:1. Updates and core upkeep of the game: anything that is not DLC gets very very little attention. Includes everything from bugfixes to balancing (especially for single player), new free content, QoL passes especially on older factions.2. Reworks of non-DLC factions are few and far between, and each DLC introduction seems to get implemented without accounting for how it impacts existing factions. Includes obvious things like broken faction mechanics going unpatched for weeks or months, but also basic campaign ""is it fun"" sniff tests (the least fun campaign starts happened from neglect as DLC was added), under the hood core gameplay mechanics (diplomacy, trade) addressed or overhauled for DLC lords or factions but left 2010 ""functional"" for the rest, AI cheats in lieu of meaningful challenge etc. Even map design.3. Modding community left to carry the load for creative reworks and revisits, QoL changes, fun factor.4. The reason for all the negative reviews currently: three lords for three of the least played factions makes sense on a corporate balance sheet. It even made me hope that it would include reworks and comprehensive retooling of the factions in question as a whole to make them more attractive to play. Win win for CA and the player base.

"I absolutely cannot understand why there are so many rave reviews for this game. In my opinion, to get straight to the point: Blackmyth Wukong is a solid game but by no means outstanding or a Game of the Year contender.First, the positive aspects:- Graphics & Atmosphere: This cannot be taken away from the game. The graphics are by far the best I have ever seen in a game. The texture details, the light-shadow balance, and the general look of the game are simply breathtaking.The animations are incredibly well done; for example, the animation changes when you swing into an attack from a dodge move compared to a normal attack. This creates a high level of realism and atmosphere.- Soundtrack: The soundtrack is wonderfully composed and greatly enhances the boss fights and overall atmosphere.- Cinematic Presentation and Cutscenes: The animations at the end of a chapter are absolute masterpieces. (Though I didn’t understand how 4 out of 6 of them relate to the story, but fine), and the cutscenes during a fight (like in the intro or the final boss) are top-notch. This was actually the main reason why I found the game so cool.- AAA Title without Extra Costs: Few to no bugs, no cost traps, no additional content locked behind a paywall.The negative aspects:- Story: I have no knowledge of Chinese mythology and therefore perceived the story accordingly. The intro is absolutely fantastic, it really hooked me, and I was highly motivated to learn who these “gods” are, the “court,” and how to fight them. Unfortunately, this becomes completely irrelevant. You go through chapter after chapter searching for relics, and each chapter basically contains its “own” storyline. The storylines are neither interesting nor exciting. Even when you develop a connection or interest in a certain aspect of the story, the chapter ends and a different, new storyline with new characters begins. There are very few characters that span across multiple chapters. As a result, at least for me, I had no motivation to continue playing. The end of the game is, in my eyes, completely nonsensical in terms of the story and only underscores how cryptic, disjointed, and boring the story is. I feel like the game is trying hard to be like Elden Ring but fails to deliver the story like FromSoftware does.- Map and Level Design: The level design is complete garbage. You wander around for hours, there is no map, and you constantly get lost. Most of the time, the places also look so similar to each other that you almost can’t find your way around anymore. Since the game relies on very few HUD indicators (which I generally think is cool), you don’t know where to go and get lost even more. This wouldn’t be a problem if the world at least gave you a reason to explore: It doesn’t. Everything you loot consists of crafting materials. These give no motivation for exploration. Armor and weapons are only unlocked as part of the story and cannot be found in any chests.The fact that invisible walls border the map doesn’t make it any better, as you often think, ""Oh, it must continue over there,"" and then you run into an invisible wall. In my opinion, that doesn’t belong in an AAA title.- Bosses & Gameplay: The bosses are a topic of their own. Firstly, apart from the intro, the final boss, and a few exceptions, I find all bosses to be completely forgettable. They are boring, there are waaaay too maaaany of them, and they look boring too. In 90% of cases, it's a human with some animal head. Don’t get me wrong; their attacks and all the visuals are more than fantastic. But if you think you’re getting bosses like FromSoftware delivers, you’re in the wrong place.The gameplay is one of the biggest criticisms for me. Extremely monotonous and boring, especially for a game with at least 20 hours of playtime. The combos are very limited (feels like there are about three of them), and you do the same thing all the time. This not only looks boring in the long run but almost killed my desire to play. The dodging feels very satisfying but also partially very random. Often, it happened that a boss clearly hit me with an ability, and I dodged a second later, but the game registered it as a perfect dodge. Also, the hitboxes are so random; I don't know if these are bugs or just poor hitbox design. And when you've been hammering away at a boss with the same three moves for 15 minutes and then die from a hit that clearly misses, you lose your mind. Or you fight a boss who spends 90% of the time flying and is unhittable, and you're basically playing a dodge simulator.- Difficulty: As a big Soulslike fan, I love that the game is not easy. But it's a different kind of difficulty compared to the Souls series, for example. Elden Ring feels very fair in its difficulty. You learn the bosses’ patterns, their moves, and abilities, and you make it on your 50th try. In Wukong, I did not get that feeling. The game is certainly not easy, but it’s not really ""fun difficult"" either. It feels artificially hard when every boss rushes at you with endless combos, or every second boss turns invisible, or creates six copies of itself, or ten tornadoes that sweep across the map, and just touching one catapults you into the air while you still have to dodge the boss itself. Most of the time, the bosses have AoE attacks and love to dash across the entire map at you. This feels artificially and unfairly difficult. It’s like saying, ""Minecraft is the hardest game because you spawn with a wooden sword in a 10x10 room against 100 Endermen."" That’s not fun hard; that’s boring and lazy. That’s how the bosses in Wukong feel.I am very, very disappointed after having looked forward to this game so much. You can really see—and I never want to deny this—how much love went into making this game. But sometimes passion and love alone are not enough.",absolut understand mani rave review game opinion get straight point blackmyth wukong solid game mean outstand game year contenderfirst posit aspect graphic atmospher taken away game graphic far best ever seen game textur detail lightshadow balanc gener look game simpli breathtakingth anim incred well done exampl anim chang swing attack dodg move compar normal attack creat high level realism atmospher soundtrack soundtrack wonder compos greatli enhanc boss fight overal atmospher cinemat present cutscen anim end chapter absolut masterpiec though didnt understand relat stori fine cutscen fight like intro final boss topnotch actual main reason found game cool aaa titl without extra cost bug cost trap addit content lock behind paywallth neg aspect stori knowledg chines mytholog therefor perceiv stori accordingli intro absolut fantast realli hook highli motiv learn god court fight unfortun becom complet irrelev go chapter chapter search relic chapter basic contain storylin storylin neither interest excit even develop connect interest certain aspect stori chapter end differ new storylin new charact begin charact span across multipl chapter result least motiv continu play end game eye complet nonsens term stori underscor cryptic disjoint bore stori feel like game tri hard like elden ring fail deliv stori like fromsoftwar map level design level design complet garbag wander around hour map constantli get lost time place also look similar almost cant find way around anymor sinc game reli hud indic gener think cool dont know go get lost even wouldnt problem world least gave reason explor doesnt everyth loot consist craft materi give motiv explor armor weapon unlock part stori found cheststh fact invis wall border map doesnt make better often think oh must continu run invis wall opinion doesnt belong aaa titl boss gameplay boss topic firstli apart intro final boss except find boss complet forgett bore waaaay maaaani look bore case human anim head dont get wrong attack visual fantast think your get boss like fromsoftwar deliv your wrong placeth gameplay one biggest critic extrem monoton bore especi game least hour playtim combo limit feel like three thing time look bore long run almost kill desir play dodg feel satisfi also partial random often happen boss clearli hit abil dodg second later game regist perfect dodg also hitbox random dont know bug poor hitbox design youv hammer away boss three move minut die hit clearli miss lose mind fight boss spend time fli unhitt your basic play dodg simul difficulti big soulslik fan love game easi differ kind difficulti compar soul seri exampl elden ring feel fair difficulti learn boss pattern move abil make tri wukong get feel game certainli easi realli fun difficult either feel artifici hard everi boss rush endless combo everi second boss turn invis creat six copi ten tornado sweep across map touch one catapult air still dodg boss time boss aoe attack love dash across entir map feel artifici unfairli difficult like say minecraft hardest game spawn wooden sword room endermen that fun hard that bore lazi that boss wukong feeli disappoint look forward game much realli seeand never want deni thishow much love went make game sometim passion love alon enough

"Love the concept and the main idea...but it just feels terrible, mobile rush ported to PC terrible, it's trying to be to many things at once. Please Note: The game also has a ton of reg files in win startup, I recommend using Revo Uninstaller rather than steam uninstall cause steam wont touch it cause yk that 1.9GB install than wasn't through steam at the start. Follow up with Autoruns [learn.microsoft.com] to remove the start up, right click delete fellas (it shows up as 2 and 95 with other things following after). if you already uninstalled the game just tap install pause then Revo will find it.Issues:- Insane desync- Clunky combat- Very little gets explained without reading a ton- When fighting in PVE randoms can just steal deviants if your not able to get to it first (in our case we fell of a cliff due to a shock wave)- More MMO than survival- Tons of notifications for random things, mark as read would be so simple- Random graphic setting issues that don't always show in settings, need to manual change in files, along with other setting issues- Some people are just restricted to what servers they have access too? - Server menu population display VS actual population is highly incorrect, often will say server is full when population is low",love concept main ideabut feel terribl mobil rush port pc terribl tri mani thing pleas note game also ton reg file win startup recommend use revo uninstal rather steam uninstal caus steam wont touch caus yk instal wasnt steam start follow autorun learnmicrosoftcom remov start right click delet fella show thing follow alreadi uninstal game tap instal paus revo find itissu insan desync clunki combat littl get explain without read ton fight pve random steal deviant abl get first case fell cliff due shock wave mmo surviv ton notif random thing mark read would simpl random graphic set issu dont alway show set need manual chang file along set issu peopl restrict server access server menu popul display vs actual popul highli incorrect often say server full popul low

The voice acting is top notch and really reels you in. I am also satisfied with the number of cut-scenes so far it really feels like a single player game with multiplayer features.Does the game stutter for me from time to time? Yes, but that's okay! It reminds me to blink every once in a while. Is it my set up probably?Yes, at least that's what I think. To be honest I am not that great with tech stuff yet with PC!

"2022 I am huge fan of Souls game, so i was so hyped. For me this game is most worthy for that anticipation of 3 years of date. When i first heard on E3 in 2019 of this game i thought it will be good Souls game, but after they announced freemode and stuff i've had great hope that this will be most rated game ever. I can tell you that 48 hours before game was released i was counting every second of it and when i saw from early reviewers ratings for game seconds got just double up longer. DirectX 12 is breaking every game so this one hits it to with bad peformance, but still game is playable and we haved issue with even more games with peformances of DX12.Game on PC with AMD configuration for me is peforming well without any issue of FPS drops or stuttering, but i see alot of ppl having that issue only on Intel and Nvidia.I don't have alot of hours in this game so for now these are My Ratings:Soundtrack: 10+/10 (I gave on previous souls games 10/10, but this one is really special)Gameplay: 10/10Graphics: 10/10Physics: 10/10 (This is probably causing alot of FPS issue, but still ragdolls and physics in game are so satisfying)Map exploration: 10/10 (There is alot of places that needs to be explored and game is much longer for real souls players now)Boss Fights: 10/10Character Customizaton: 10/10Online Mode: 10/10 (Multiplayer comparing to others is much better and there is alot of improvment, cheaters doesn't exist)My final thoughts about this game: Game is good and it will probably be GOTY for this year, so who ever like challenges and tough boss fights he should try this game. After additional nearly 300 hours and 100% achievments i can confirm this game is worth giving a try and to spend alot time on exploring.",huge fan soul game hype game worthi anticip year date first heard game thought good soul game announc freemod stuff ive great hope rate game ever tell hour game releas count everi second saw earli review rate game second got doubl longer directx break everi game one hit bad peform still game playabl have issu even game peform pc amd configur peform well without issu fp drop stutter see alot ppl issu intel nvidiai dont alot hour game ratingssoundtrack gave previou soul game one realli specialgameplay probabl caus alot fp issu still ragdol physic game satisfyingmap explor alot place need explor game much longer real soul player nowboss fight customizaton mode multiplay compar other much better alot improv cheater doesnt existmi final thought game game good probabl goti year ever like challeng tough boss fight tri game addit nearli hour achiev confirm game worth give tri spend alot time explor

You’re the hero, the legend, the one everyone looks up to.

"2022 FromSoftware not only integrated all the different core mechanics that they have created through the years but also added some basic(crouch, jump) and new mechanics(spirit summoning, guard counter) to enhance the core gameplay deeply. If you are new to the FromSoftware's souls formula this game is the most accessible title you can ever get. There were some optimization issues here and there but it wasn't that game-breaking at least for me. Fromsoft's artwork as fine as ever. Sometimes you just stop your companion Torrent and take a look at The Erdtree's greatness and magnificence and you might say ""Holy S*** this game looks beautiful"" despite the fact that graphical quality has never been FromSoftware's primary concern. Mounted combat is the best one I have ever seen in any game. Torrent can do double jump and this made the mounted combat far more enjoyable than I expected. Although I have to admit sometimes it gets frustrating because some bosses can knock you off from Torrent with one hit. Spirit summoning is fun and all but some bosses are way too hard(Malenia, Godfrey, Radagon,) without summons especially for melee users. They have lots of AoE(Area of Effect) movesets and insane health and stamina pool. Sometimes bosses never stop attacking. If you do use spirit summons you don't feel rewarded(at least in my case) after destroying Malenia with +10 Tear Mimic. Even though the bosses aren't that great I loved their themes that's for sure. Fromsoftware's one of the signatures is the boss themes. Even the ambience music tries to tell you a story. As soon as you entered the Caelid you know you are in a rotted and corrupted place to its very core because of the ambience music. Overall, Elden Ring exceeded its predeccessor and changed the meaning of ""open-world"" and ""difficulty""From Software's magnum opus.Thank you for this beautiful piece of art.",fromsoftwar integr differ core mechan creat year also ad basiccrouch jump new mechanicsspirit summon guard counter enhanc core gameplay deepli new fromsoftwar soul formula game access titl ever get optim issu wasnt gamebreak least fromsoft artwork fine ever sometim stop companion torrent take look erdtre great magnific might say holi game look beauti despit fact graphic qualiti never fromsoftwar primari concern mount combat best one ever seen game torrent doubl jump made mount combat far enjoy expect although admit sometim get frustrat boss knock torrent one hit spirit summon fun boss way hardmalenia godfrey radagon without summon especi mele user lot aoearea effect moveset insan health stamina pool sometim boss never stop attack use spirit summon dont feel rewardedat least case destroy malenia tear mimic even though boss arent great love theme that sure fromsoftwar one signatur boss theme even ambienc music tri tell stori soon enter caelid know rot corrupt place core ambienc music overal elden ring exceed predeccessor chang mean openworld difficultyfrom softwar magnum opusthank beauti piec art
"Honestly Game of the Year 2024. This is what Triple A gaming at 60$ should deliver! And I agree, this sends a big message to Budding Chinese Developers and Worldwide that Singleplayer games ARE PROFITABLE. With how prevalent Gacha Games and Online games are, Hopefully this is a wake up call to invest more into this instead of Gacha and the like. As for the challenge, since im no Dark Souls fan, im more of Different Difficult Game fan (mostly rhythm games) however, this is properly paced and balanced. There are times where camera and weird large AOE hitboxes are frustrating to deal with but the defensive options are very lenient. Havent encountered a boss that took me more than 10 tries to take out. Especially I want to share the Peak moment was (SPOILERS) when I fought the Heavenly Kings and the fight blurred between Cinematic and Gameplay and everything flowed so smoothly. It was an experience! A few nitpicks tho like getting from point A to point B is pretty slow. especially when chapter map sizes open up. The need for the Mount which is the Cloud should've been there early at least. Encountered a bug where a higher quality in Global Illumination, turns off sun shadows and lighting unless I pick it at low.

"2022 For the first time, I am doing a revised review for a game. Originally, I had given this game a negative review because I felt the cons outweighed the pros. But after patch 1.03 and continuing to play the game, I feel Elden Ring deserves a revised review which I will be giving it a positive score. However, I do have plenty of cons to mention regardless.Graphics:Game is breathtaking to look at. So many moments of me wanting to take a screenshot and enjoy the scenery of it all. Even the 'worst' of places in Elden Ring still looks great, and the visuals are top notch. Out of all the From Software games, they really made this game incredible on the eyes. Absolutely jaw dropping to say the least.Gameplay:Soul games have always been linear and well designed, so I was afraid of how From Software would handle an open world. Gotta say, they did a very excellent job. You can pretty much almost go anywhere you'd like with a few exceptions, and Elden Ring took all previous games before it and placed them all into this one, the best traits anyways. So much variety of builds to go with, a lot of ways to fight, Ashes of War are incredible since they truly spice up combat and the fact you can fight while on horseback is so fun overall. Also every part of the world is filled with something- not a single place is empty. So many secrets, discoveries, unique bosses, and hidden lore that it is brimming. I'm very impressed to say the least.Also which ever employee came up with Spirit Summons, give them a raise. They're a super fun concept and the best solution if you somehow can't (or unwilling) to play online. Fantastic concept and well executed for sure.Difficulty:It's a Souls like, it is going to be hard. While I would even say Elden Ring is the hardest Souls yet, the devs have given people so many ways in approaching a fight. The game rewards players for exploring, getting stronger, finding better weapons or loot, and coming back to a boss to overcome it. While some builds are far superior depending on what you optimize, every build is good enough and so long as you're experienced and patient, the game can be beaten even with a lvl 1 character. It's all about how you go about a fight and learn from your mistakes.NPCs and Quests:Perhaps the most depth of any previous Souls game as well, since there's so many NPCs to interact with, telling a story, having quests, and these ones actually move around the world which impacts the story. Some will be more of a fan favorite than others, but each NPC is well written and I definitely loved their dynamics, including the fact some outright help you in fights you would of otherwise struggled with. Doing and completing their quest lines not only rewards you with loot, but can even lead to changes and some secrets that wouldn't be possible otherwise.Cons:So ... despite Elden Ring is a very good game, great even- there are a lot of issues I have with the game even after patch 1.03 which fixed or improved the problems I had beforehand.Vagueness:To explain, the game gives little to no hints on how to progress certain NPC quests, what they'll do next, where to go at times (apart from main mandatory bosses), key items, very essential items, and so forth. I understand Souls games in the past have held back secrets but because they were linear, it was easy to check every corner and not miss too much. Here? The game is open world and the devs went out of their way to hide a lot of stuff, to the point you WILL need a guide or go into NG+. While I get they want you to replay their game and invest, it isn't properly executed. I know fans will say it rewards players for discovering stuff on their own, but the fact there's no quest markers, completion entries, or anything to let you know who's gone where, it takes me out of the game by a lot since I hate missing stuff.Multiplayer:So this is a big one. I can't seem to co-op with friends, much at all. I can help strangers but if I use a password, game often disconnects me or downright crashes. Then you have people who are cheating often in PvP, using the most meta stuff that makes you die instantly (bleed builds ...) and honestly it doesn't feel like the devs balanced it well at all. The game is amazing in PvE, but PvP? Very unstable and not exactly good. Only plus side is helping those struggling with a boss but that's if the game lets me do so. No other game in my library has this issue with me doing multiplayer.Crashes and Stutters:Game will at times crash or stutter hard. It is at random, and nothing fixes it. I am not too upset due to the fact it isn't often, but when it does happen- it is quite terrible to experience. My graphics card is up to date, newer version, and again no other game in my library (besides infamous Skyrim) has this problem. I personally think they need to do more patches to fix this since so many are facing this issue still.Meta:This game is obsessed with certain builds, as they're very strong and can make the fight trivial even. If you do a bleed build or hyper magic build, you will destroy both PvE and PvP. If you do a strength build, you are hindering yourself sadly as so many enemies are fast, hit harder, and can tank against your heavy hits. Also some Ashes of War are outright broken. Also the meta for this game is very off putting- rather than earning your stuff, you can easily run around collecting upgrades and get your weapon to +9 or even 10 before killing a single boss. I know you don't have to do this, but knowing it's possible makes me wonder why handicap myself and struggle when I can just be overpowered off the start. I'd rather struggle and be forced to like previous games, even if there was cheese-like methods this game has too many opportunities to make you feel you need to be meta to just keep up in PvE and PvP.Conclusion:Game is great, very good I would say. A lot of downsides, with mostly it hiding important information and key items from you, forcing you to scout and possibly become overpowered to just win early. Not exactly the best, but for those who like to do whatever- it does benefit those people since they can just get to level 45, 10+ weapon before fighting the first boss (after the tutorial boss). Game's balance is questionable, and a lot of issues with multiplayer with meta and disconnections / crashes. But otherwise, game is very fun, engaging, has so much content, awesome bosses, and so much variety to the builds if you don't want to be meta. I am giving this a positive score but it was close to still being negative like the first review I did.Still hoping DLC comes out for this game i'm waiting with baited breath!",first time revis review game origin given game neg review felt con outweigh pro patch continu play game feel elden ring deserv revis review give posit score howev plenti con mention regardlessgraphicsgam breathtak look mani moment want take screenshot enjoy sceneri even worst place elden ring still look great visual top notch softwar game realli made game incred eye absolut jaw drop say leastgameplaysoul game alway linear well design afraid softwar would handl open world got ta say excel job pretti much almost go anywher youd like except elden ring took previou game place one best trait anyway much varieti build go lot way fight ash war incred sinc truli spice combat fact fight horseback fun overal also everi part world fill someth singl place empti mani secret discoveri uniqu boss hidden lore brim im impress say leastalso ever employe came spirit summon give rais theyr super fun concept best solut somehow cant unwil play onlin fantast concept well execut suredifficultyit soul like go hard would even say elden ring hardest soul yet dev given peopl mani way approach fight game reward player explor get stronger find better weapon loot come back boss overcom build far superior depend optim everi build good enough long your experienc patient game beaten even lvl charact go fight learn mistakesnpc questsperhap depth previou soul game well sinc there mani npc interact tell stori quest one actual move around world impact stori fan favorit other npc well written definit love dynam includ fact outright help fight would otherwis struggl complet quest line reward loot even lead chang secret wouldnt possibl otherwiseconsso despit elden ring good game great even lot issu game even patch fix improv problem beforehandvaguenessto explain game give littl hint progress certain npc quest theyll next go time apart main mandatori boss key item essenti item forth understand soul game past held back secret linear easi check everi corner miss much game open world dev went way hide lot stuff point need guid go ng get want replay game invest isnt properli execut know fan say reward player discov stuff fact there quest marker complet entri anyth let know who gone take game lot sinc hate miss stuffmultiplayerso big one cant seem coop friend much help stranger use password game often disconnect downright crash peopl cheat often pvp use meta stuff make die instantli bleed build honestli doesnt feel like dev balanc well game amaz pve pvp unstabl exactli good plu side help struggl boss that game let game librari issu multiplayercrash stuttersgam time crash stutter hard random noth fix upset due fact isnt often happen quit terribl experi graphic card date newer version game librari besid infam skyrim problem person think need patch fix sinc mani face issu stillmetathi game obsess certain build theyr strong make fight trivial even bleed build hyper magic build destroy pve pvp strength build hinder sadli mani enemi fast hit harder tank heavi hit also ash war outright broken also meta game put rather earn stuff easili run around collect upgrad get weapon even kill singl boss know dont know possibl make wonder handicap struggl overpow start id rather struggl forc like previou game even cheeselik method game mani opportun make feel need meta keep pve pvpconclusiongam great good would say lot downsid mostli hide import inform key item forc scout possibl becom overpow win earli exactli best like whatev benefit peopl sinc get level weapon fight first boss tutori boss game balanc question lot issu multiplay meta disconnect crash otherwis game fun engag much content awesom boss much varieti build dont want meta give posit score close still neg like first review didstil hope dlc come game im wait bait breath

"2022 I had enormous expectations having put a thousand hours into Dark Souls 3 alone. Sadly, ER is tainted by design decisions not fully thought through, and a refusal to question the ideals of a framework first established with Demon’s Souls in 2009, and I ended it wishing I hadn't played it at all (more on this later) - or that Steam would finally add a neutral rating.For context, excluding a discarded run and multiplayer, my completionist and almost entirely guide-free solo run lasted around 150 hours, beating every boss barring Malenia without summons.Let’s open positively: Elden Ring inherits DS3’s DNA, particularly combat: The same crunchy brawls, responsive controls and top-tier animations that characterised DS3, aided by expanded enemy, weapon, and ability variety with magic being more diverse than ever.From’s signature storytelling returns, requiring piecing together environmental details, item descriptions and other vague information to decipher the full picture, avoiding interminable cutscenes or overbearing HUD notifications.The Lands Between is geographically impressive. It fuses aesthetically and mechanically diverse biomes into vertiginously stacked layers, threading interesting discoveries through challenging navigation, aided by a time of day and weather system that adds subtle gameplay changes.So why the thumbs down?DS3 is great because it’s meaningful. It’s an incredible fantasy brawler, but shines with its premise of a cursed world having its blighted existence artificially prolonged by an age of fire unnaturally lengthened by Gwyn and his tragic legacy’s followers. The Ringed City DLC literally warped and smashed the series together until only ash remained at the end of the world and time itself in a manifestation of cosmic decay from a realm prohibited from moving on. Its creatively defiant metacommentary rejected a pop culture engorged on commercialised nostalgia and humanity’s obsession with the past impeding a new, better world being built, using From’s own ludography to show stagnation blocking progress. It had to innovate to avoid hypocrisy, so it repurposed old combat mechanics and weaponry into new rhythms, and tonally shifted from quiet hope in the face of graceful sadness to crushing desperation - not to fix its cursed world, but to euthanise it and start anew instead - while retaining the series’ unrelenting melancholy and heart of gold.ER ignores that. It retroactively invalidates DS3’s message of moving on from an unsustainably tired world by repurposing years of content, and when it does deviate, it does so uncharacteristically clumsily for From. This is why I wish I hadn’t played it: DS3 made me laugh, cry, and stuck in my mind for years, and was ultimately about something bigger than itself - and powerfully resonated for it. ER contradicts DS3’s critique of wheel-spinning by indulging repackaged nostalgia in the same way Disney’s maligned Star Wars trilogy has left people feeling worse towards the franchise than if no new films had been made at all.The story is shockingly conservative, with almost identical plot points, settings, characters, and themes to From’s back catalogue. We again have well-intended rulers cursing the world in an attempt to save it, religious fundamentalists, spurned vengeful offspring, agents of chaos, and a tarnished (now literally!) player enforcing a new world order. The biggest change is a bloated chain of divine command, expanding DS' demigods with Empyrians, Fingers, the Elden Beast, aliens, and cosmic gods, but it brings few new ideas. This is the reanimated corpse of a concluded story that meta-commented on such narrative necromancy, and is immensely disappointing for it. Worse, what little new exists is often explicit and definitive, trading the intriguing mystery of DS’s nebulous motivations and history that still produce seismic theories a decade later, for a story nearly entirely resolvable in a single playthrough.There is a tonal shift from quiet tragedy to bellicose grandeur of divine infighting exploding into total warfare - but if anything interferes with deep emotional investment, it’s unlikeable middle managers arguing over who deserves the office promotion. Conflict between irredeemable villains is a far cry from the turbulent power of DS’s Greek tragedy, particularly in a setting largely morally binary and with a less charismatic cast. Standouts like Rya or Blaidd don't impact like Solaire’s devastating misfortune or Siegward’s surprising nobility. Characters were the emotional core of DS, but are neutered here by worn tropes and the meandering pacing inherent to open worlds.Gameplay is also a missed opportunity. DS3’s combat is great, but Sekiro’s is easily the best ever in a game of its type - yet we’re back to DS3’s unbalanced weapon classes and abilities, inconsistent magic, and same old movesets, lacking Sekiro’s thrilling posture and counters mechanics. Dual wielding, ashes of war and guard counters are small improvements rather than an overhaul that had six years to materialise, and the camera is as bad as ever. Content suffers from repetition too: Dungeons keep cropping, with the same music, bosses and presentation, occupying a huge chunk of a completionist’s playthrough, and the non-dungeon biomes feel interminable as you’re incentivised to be extremely thorough in these needlessly enormous areas in search of equipment, lore, and quests.Quests are as obtuse as everyone’s saying, borderline impossible to complete without guides, a From staple magnified by the overwhelmingly gigantic map diluting quality even further. ER’s first areas are exciting, but fifty hours in become tedious, particularly with the second half’s environments primarily being single-level plains with occasional repeated giant assets.The initially impressive scope grows tiresome in its enormity, and leads to a game that’s harder to balance and populate with unique content, particularly evident in the later difficulty spikes and clearly unfinished areas and encounters, including final bosses that pale in comparison to the thematic or mechanical significance of DS3’s Soul of Cinder and Slave Knight Gael. Bosses are just bad across the board: Most movesets chain four or five attacks together leave you waiting for an opening far longer than actually fighting, and many require specific builds to overcome damage sponges, homogenising combat into a wait - wait - wait - wait - single attack - wait loop. ~150 bosses is too many for From to make each interesting, fair, memorable, or downright enjoyable.ER’s multiplayer is also From’s worst since DS1. Hits can sometimes take over ten seconds to register and disconnects prevail. Reduced summon counts neuters fight clubs, invasions are overly unbalanced and spawns are terrible, and with covenants gone, so too are the emergent player dynamics and roleplay.Finally, ER’s presentation is mixed. Its style is outstanding: Characters are strikingly creative and full of personality, environments are dense with detail, and sound effects are as satisfying as ever, though the music rarely reaches DS3’s heights and is often repeated. But From’s ambition far outpaced their technical capacity: ER is graphically antiquated, but the elephant in the room is the worst shader compilation stutter in years, paired with disappointing framerates, considerable crashing, and cheating aplenty. The stutter single-handedly ruined the first third of my playthrough, dissipating after about 70 hours but never fully resolving, and is bad enough to alone make this review a thumbs down.ER wavers between being a retread of old ideas and a failed attempt at new ones. It's such a missed opportunity. If all you want is killing enemies in brutal combat, it’s great - the DS template alone earns ER inherited praise - but if you’re after an emotionally and philosophically challenging story, pick up DS instead.★★★☆☆",enorm expect put thousand hour dark soul alon sadli er taint design decis fulli thought refus question ideal framework first establish demon soul end wish hadnt play later steam would

"First off, this game has been an absolute joy to play. The story missions are fantastic, and the cinematics really enhance the experience. The way the operations work in tandem with the missions is also impressive. I highly recommend tackling the story missions in order with the operations; doing all the operations first can spoil the storyline.I’ve maxed out two classes and can comfortably handle the hardest difficulty with ease. While the PvP aspect is a bit slow-paced by design and I haven’t invested many hours into it, it hasn’t been particularly engaging.Unfortunately, I’m nearing the end of my time with the game, aside from maxing out a few more classes and helping friends. I really hope they add another couple of difficulties beyond the upcoming lethal mode, as well as some extra challenging enemies during missions. I wish I could experience the first 15 hours of the game again.Replayability is somewhat lacking due to the limited number of operations and the absence of significant challenges once you reach level 15 on any class. The excitement starts to wane after completing the story and operations.It’s also disappointing that the horde mode isn’t coming until 2025. However, I would definitely recommend this game. Just don’t expect it to be a staple in your gaming routine; once you’ve completed the story and operations, there isn’t much left to keep you engaged.Overall, I’d give it a 9/10. ❤️",first game absolut joy play stori mission fantast cinemat realli enhanc experi way oper work tandem mission also impress highli recommend tackl stori mission order oper oper first spoil storylin max two class comfort handl hardest difficulti eas pvp aspect bit slowpac design havent invest mani hour hasnt particularli engagingunfortun im near end time game asid max class help friend realli hope add anoth coupl difficulti beyond upcom lethal mode well extra challeng enemi mission wish could experi first hour game againreplay somewhat lack due limit number oper absenc signific challeng reach level class excit start wane complet stori operationsit also disappoint hord mode isnt come howev would definit recommend game dont expect stapl game routin youv complet stori oper isnt much left keep engagedoveral id give
"Product received for free I got this game for free as a promotion with a graphics card I bought, I hadn't watched any trailers for it and never really looked into it. I went in with no expectations or hype whatsoever, and frankly I don't get it.The game has terrible level design, you are bound to hit an invisible wall (even if the place you are trying to reach is part of the level, sometimes there's just an invisible wall to prevent you from going there from a specific angle for some reasons) no matter where you go, the paths are also not intuitive, I was actually going around the level trying to find what I had missed only to find out that there was a small gap to crawl in to progress hidden inside a cave, there was nothing to tell me this was there, I found it by pure chance, the combination of the invisible walls, non-intuitive levels and the lack of a map to find those paths on makes exploring very frustrating.The combat feels wrong, sometimes you do an input mid-roll and the character does the move related to that input right after the roll, and sometimes he does not, heavy attacks have ridiculous delay to them which makes them feel terrible to use. In some fights, you could start a heavy attack before the boss starts his attack and get punished anyway. You barely do any damage to bosses and kill regular enemies way too easily, which makes the bosses the only actual challenge, well except for actually finding them, unfortunately the bosses have terrible arena designs and sometimes attack fast enough to get you with a follow-up attack right after your dodge. The story relies way too much on the base material, if you have not read the book, none of it makes sense.The game does look pretty, but if its not fun then why would I play it.",product receiv free got game free promot graphic card bought hadnt watch trailer never realli look went expect hype whatsoev frankli dont get itth game terribl level design bound hit invis wall even place tri reach part level sometim there invis wall prevent go specif angl reason matter go path also intuit actual go around level tri find miss find small gap crawl progress hidden insid cave noth tell found pure chanc combin invis wall nonintuit level lack map find path make explor frustratingth combat feel wrong sometim input midrol charact move relat input right roll sometim heavi attack ridicul delay make feel terribl use fight could start heavi attack boss start attack get punish anyway bare damag boss kill regular enemi way easili make boss actual challeng well except actual find unfortun boss terribl arena design sometim attack fast enough get followup attack right dodg stori reli way much base materi read book none make senseth game look pretti fun would play

"2023 It’s a sad day when I have to write this review. TWWH is, in my very humble opinion, the best strategy game/trilogy of all time. There are grander strategies, I.E. the paradox titles, and there are more accessible titles, I.E. the Civ series. But no game does it quite like this one. Let me get my thoughts out the way, and then I’ll explain why I can’t recommend the game, although I’m sure you’ve already heard, despite me loving this title so dearly. Let’s start by saying, this is a good game. Phenomenal even. At it’s core, it’s in every sense of the word, fun. It can be brutally challenging, but is far more accessible than many of the paradox titles for example. I’ve dipped in and out of a range of strategy games (not just on steam, but Epic, GoG and growing up playing CD copies of games I still own to this day), and generally speaking, I love the genre. I grew up playing Age of Empires and Warcraft 3 before moving away from RTS games in favour of more 4X style games. Eventually moving onto grand strategy such as Total War. And let me tell you what a blast this has been. I adore this game, I’ve spent many nights up until 5/6am, just playing “one more turn!” And being late for work the following morning because I was so tired I just overslept. I’ve sat watching videos on my lunch breaks from Legend and General, I’ve fallen asleep to Total war streams, having it consume my life for a period of time. And I don’t regret a single second of it. I’ve bought copies of it full price for my friends to play so I can share that experience with others and bring them into this community. And I mention this because despite my low playtime, I genuinely love this game, and even when I’m not playing it, I’m consuming it in whatever ways I can, or being that annoying friend who pushes you to do the same. But why? Why do I think so highly of it? Well there’s just no experience quite like it. It’s easy to learn, hard to master. Despite what perceptions of it are, it’s incredibly easy to pick up and play, even if it’s a little confusing at first. The in game tutorial does a really excellent job of just teaching you the core of what you need to know, and the rest of it you’ll pick up as you play. Unlike a paradox game, it doesn’t feel like you need a YouTube guide open as mandatory training while you play (although I suppose that subjective based on skill and patience). All my research and external work has been because I’m invested and the game is so good, that it incentivises you to learn, not because it’s too complicated for it’s own good, but just because I want to improve and get better on my own terms. And unlike more casual games like Civ, where after a campaign or two, you just go through the motions, you actually have to keep atleast a small part of your brain switched on. Even at lower difficulties, you will get smashed by what can often feel like incredibly unfair AI. The game actually ends up almost feeling rogue like in nature, you play 20 turns, realise you messed up at turn 15, and then start again, using the knowledge you gained to progress further, this time getting to turn 40 and realising you made a mistake or didn’t account for something on turn 35 and repeating. It’s an incredible loop that never gets dull or boring based simply on the fact that every faction plays so uniquely to each other. From Skarbrand’s all out blitzkrieg on anything In sight, to my new personal favourite, Empire campaigns, where you slowly build up and out, playing politics and managing multiple states of affairs. I firmly believe there is a faction for anyone and everyone, and you WILL find something or someone you like in this game. I’m going to brush over gameplay and such, because I won’t lie, it’s great. As the ancient Chinese say, “It Just Works”. The overworld map is basically a relatively simple 4x style game. You have cities, ruins, towns etc, various sizes locations you can colonise to control regions, before setting out and conquering or politicking your way into others. There’s not much to say to it. It’s big, it’s fun, it’s a paint the map in your colour type of ordeal that isn’t particularly unique to this game. And then there’s the battles, where the game just blows you away. Hundreds and later at times thousands of individual units, all modelled and animated smashing into each other in the RTS style battles. You can watch as a giant T-Rex smashes it’s way through tiny little nurglings, small creatures that clump together to make large monstrosities, all while your massive great unclean one charges into ranks of lizardmen before tactically chundering and excreting all over them. It’s phenomenal and if you’re the type of person to watch AI battles on YouTube, you’ll absolutely adore it. Hundreds of battle maps, hundreds of unique units, with thousands of animations (I’m sorry I didn’t count each one but there’s a lot!). It’s immense in scale and spectacle in a way no other franchise can really rival. And most importantly, it’s fun! Winning feels great, but losing doesn’t feel bad when you watched as packs of rat men slowly swarm your empire city, each man holding the line as best they can, faith and steel binding them. It’s exciting and gorgeous. I’ve never enjoyed getting my ass handed to me so much. But onto why I can’t recommend the game. Two reasons, with one being an ongoing issue in the state of DLC, and the other being the recent actions by the developer. DLC for this game is kind of egregious. There’s going to be people who say, just buy the ones you want, but I’m not a huge fan of that mentality. The main draw of these games specifically is the immortal empires map, where all the factions across all three games play on one unified map. It’s huge, and really brings the grand into grand strategy. It’s a spectacle and genuinely an incredible feat, with 200+ factions on the map. However, of the around 80 playable lords, buying Warhammer 3 alone, only gives you access to around 15/20, which is a lot of gameplay don’t get me wrong, but with around half of those being chaos themed, and the rest being a take your pick between Slavic stew or ancient Asian hotpot, there’s not all that much variety in terms of visuals and aesthetic. To get the full experience and have the choice of playing whatever you want, you need to pay out hundreds of pounds just to get every dlc and every game and then every dlc for those games. It’s just all a bit much. It’s something total war fans have put up with, and it’s something I’ve financially supported due to having the disposable income and enjoying the games. However as a new player, imagine looking at the game thinking, I just want the complete experience, access to everything that’s in the game and finding out you’ll have to spend well over £200 just to have the option to play a race. And it’s not like you can try the races either, there’s no demo, and with campaigns lasting anywhere from 10 to 60 hours, you can’t try them and then just refund realistically. It’s something I looked past for a long time, but with recent events, I just can’t support this model anymore. And those recent events. You’ve heard about them, there’s a reason everyone is reviewing this negatively. Creative Assembly is now forcing unwarranted price increases on these already quite minimal DLCs. £20 (a third of the price of the game might I add) for three lords, no one was particularly excited or asking for, with very few additions other than that no real new units with issues coming with the ones they did add, serious bugs that they still refuse to fix or just ignore, and a frankly, quite disgusting response to fan criticism and feedback, vaguely threatening to cut support for the game should fans choose not to pay for the dlc. This is a company who’s revenue has increased by 20% over the last year, who release updates at a speed that it would be generous to call slow, all while claiming that they need to do this to keep up with the market",sad day write review twwh humbl opinion best strategi gametrilog time grander strategi ie paradox titl access titl ie civ seri game quit like one let get thought way ill explain cant recommend game although im sure youv alreadi heard despit love titl dearli let start say good game phenomen even core everi sens word fun brutal challeng far access mani paradox titl exampl ive dip rang strategi game steam epic gog grow play cd copi game still day gener speak love genr grew play age empir warcraft move away rt game favour style game eventu move onto grand strategi total war let tell blast ador game ive spent mani night play one turn late work follow morn tire overslept ive sat watch video lunch break legend gener ive fallen asleep total war stream consum life period time dont regret singl second ive bought copi full price friend play share experi other bring commun mention despit low playtim genuin love game even im play im consum whatev way annoy friend push think highli well there experi quit like easi learn hard master despit percept incred easi pick play even littl confus first game tutori realli excel job teach core need know rest youll pick play unlik paradox game doesnt feel like need youtub guid open mandatori train play although suppos subject base skill patienc research extern work im invest game good incentivis learn complic good want improv get better term unlik casual game like civ campaign two go motion actual keep atleast small part brain switch even lower difficulti get smash often feel like incred unfair ai game actual end almost feel rogu like natur play turn realis mess turn start use knowledg gain progress time get turn realis made mistak didnt account someth turn repeat incred loop never get dull bore base simpli fact everi faction play uniqu skarbrand blitzkrieg anyth sight new person favourit empir campaign slowli build play polit manag multipl state affair firmli believ faction anyon everyon find someth someon like game im go brush gameplay wont lie great ancient chines say work overworld map basic rel simpl style game citi ruin town etc variou size locat colonis control region set conquer politick way other there much say big fun paint map colour type ordeal isnt particularli uniqu game there battl game blow away hundr later time thousand individu unit model anim smash rt style battl watch giant trex smash way tini littl nurgl small creatur clump togeth make larg monstros massiv great unclean one charg rank lizardmen tactic chunder excret phenomen your type person watch ai battl youtub youll absolut ador hundr battl map hundr uniqu unit thousand anim im sorri didnt count one there lot immens scale spectacl way franchis realli rival importantli fun win feel great lose doesnt feel bad watch pack rat men slowli swarm empir citi man hold line best faith steel bind excit gorgeou ive never enjoy get ass hand much onto cant recommend game two reason one ongo issu state dlc recent action develop dlc game kind egregi there go peopl say buy one want im huge fan mental main draw game specif immort empir map faction across three game play one unifi map huge realli bring grand grand strategi spectacl genuin incred feat faction map howev around playabl lord buy warhamm alon give access around lot gameplay dont get wrong around half chao theme rest take pick slavic stew ancient asian hotpot there much varieti term visual aesthet get full experi choic play whatev want need pay hundr pound get everi dlc everi game everi dlc game bit much someth total war fan put someth ive financi support due dispos incom enjoy game howev new player imagin look game think want complet experi access everyth that game find youll spend well option play race like tri race either there demo campaign last anywher hour cant tri refund realist someth look past long time recent event cant support model anymor recent event youv heard there reason everyon review neg creativ assembl forc unwarr price increas alreadi quit minim dlc third price game might add three lord one particularli excit ask addit real new unit issu come one add seriou bug still refus fix ignor frankli quit disgust respons fan critic feedback vagu threaten cut support game fan choos pay dlc compani who revenu increas last year releas updat speed would gener call slow claim need keep market

"ALL OPINIONS ARE BASED ON ANGEL OF DEATH DIFFICULTY PLAYED SOLO. THEY MAY NOT BE ISSUES ON LOWER DIFFICULTIES This is a good game, a game with alot of issues but I do recommend it if you are even slightly interested in WH40KCombat is pretty good, the parry system can sometimes have issues if multiple parries come up. If you time one right but then another pops up it seems to cancel it sometimes and you get hit when you were not even trying to parry the 2nd attack. The dodge always seems to work, but the problem is this game has some really wonky hitboxes so you will get hit dodging and wonder what even hit you (espicaly with bosses oh god its bad with bosses) where they have invisible hitboxes that will hit you even if you arn't even close. The Carnifex was the worst for this but its manageable.The healing system is awful on Angel of Death, the melee to restore health becomes pointless because you take so much damage you never get any back with all the enemies jumping at you. And health injectors are so rare, for many sections of the game its laughable. Your fury mode becomes the main option for healing, where you want to avoid combat and stand there and recharge but it feels counter intuitive to what it was actually meant forThe guns feel great but they sound really, really weak. I don't know if its a mixing issue or something but they lack any real oomph to them and bolters sound more like you are firing a semi automatic pistol or something and it kinda sucks, but gameplay wise I found myself using almost all the weapons at one point or another and getting results with them. Which leads to alot of experimentation and exploring the systems which is really good.There are some major bugs, some levels glitch out and you cant pickup guns or items(looking at you cargo elevator) and also sometimes the AI totally bugs out and will just refuse to rez you, they will walk towards you then get distracted and run back and forth while your meter ticks down and its infuriating. Sometimes the AI just totally loses it and will just stand still and do nothing for large periods of time. Also randomly when Acheran was giving his speech in the hanger I walked up to watch it and a space marine came up behind me and trapped me and I had to reload the entire game because I got stuck which was really random.The game falls into the trap difficulty wise what alot of games do, which is just turning things into bullet sponges that do alot of damage as opposed to real difficulty. Ghost of Tsushima mastered this, and honestly on Angel of Death if they just lowered the health pools on some enemies and kept literally everything else the same it would be way more tolerable and actually fun. Having to put 4 clips from a bolter run to get a full reload and then another couple clips into a Zoanthrope to just get it to go down becomes a point of hilarity. Although this is remedied by just having Krak grenades(which the game seems to keep forgetting you have because grenade pickups basically become extinct in the certain parts of the game)The campaign at times becomes kind of a slog when many of the major set pieces s just stand here, and do the thing that prevents meter in the top corner from going down/up. Its distracting having to watch the meter while you want to actually look at whats going on, on the screen and annoying because it feels uninspired after you do it for like the 6th time.Now all my complaints I had though, are entirely remedied with the sections of the game with the jetpacks. I honestly think they should of just built the entire game as Assault Troops because it feels amazing. The quick movement to escape hordes, jumping in and out of melee, picking off enemies in the air. It feels like thats how the game should be played. It almost turns into a doom-esque with how fast paced it becomes and its glorious. The pvp is also fantastic and I think if they keep updating with maps and unlockables it has a real leg to stand on.Games like a solid 7.5 maybe 8/10 because I am a biased fan",opinion base angel death difficulti play solo may issu lower difficulti good game game alot issu recommend even slightli interest pretti good parri system sometim issu multipl parri come time one right anoth pop seem cancel sometim get hit even tri parri attack dodg alway seem work problem game realli wonki hitbox get hit dodg wonder even hit espicali boss oh god bad boss invis hitbox hit even arnt even close carnifex worst manageableth heal system aw angel death mele restor health becom pointless take much damag never get back enemi jump health injector rare mani section game laughabl furi mode becom main option heal want avoid combat stand recharg feel counter intuit actual meant forth gun feel great sound realli realli weak dont know mix issu someth lack real oomph bolter sound like fire semi automat pistol someth kinda suck gameplay wise found use almost weapon one point anoth get result lead alot experiment explor system realli goodther major bug level glitch cant pickup gun itemslook cargo elev also sometim ai total bug refus rez walk toward get distract run back forth meter tick infuri sometim ai total lose stand still noth larg period time also randomli acheran give speech hanger walk watch space marin came behind trap reload entir game got stuck realli randomth game fall trap difficulti wise alot game turn thing bullet spong alot damag oppos real difficulti ghost tsushima master honestli angel death lower health pool enemi kept liter everyth els would way toler actual fun put clip bolter run get full reload anoth coupl clip zoanthrop get go becom point hilar although remedi krak grenadeswhich game seem keep forget grenad pickup basic becom extinct certain part gameth campaign time becom kind slog mani major set piec stand thing prevent meter top corner go downup distract watch meter want actual look what go screen annoy feel uninspir like timenow complaint though entir remedi section game jetpack honestli think built entir game assault troop feel amaz quick movement escap hord jump mele pick enemi air feel like that game play almost turn doomesqu fast pace becom gloriou pvp also fantast think keep updat map unlock real leg stand ongam like solid mayb bias fan

"2022 A fantastic game FromSoftware, probably the best game they've ever made alongside Bloodborne. While the gameplay formula mainly stays the same, they expanded exponentially on the world you get to play in,Unlike other Souls-like games where your options against a challenge are fairly limited such as farming up or become really good at reading a boss's movements, Elden Ring provides you with a plethora of options. You can explore the world and find new weapons, level up up, buy or find several unique items some of which are made to work against bosses like kryptonite.All in all, it's quite accessible more so than before so there's a lot to love here.That doesn't mean the game has become easy...oh no...It probably holds the largest amount of bosses in any games ever released. They're just staggering, with some of them being unique as well as recurring ones. While they do recycle a few, I have to say it doesn't take much from the experience as it gives you the feeling of growing and becoming more experienced showing that your struggle and effort was well worth your time.The items and weapons as well as magic gives so many options for so many builds and things to mess around with.You can now re-edit your character in case there's something you don't like about it as well as resetting your abilities in case you want to try out different builds. This addition was great and it doesn't mean you have to remake a different character just in case you want to try something different.The map is huge, enormous even and in any direction you will go, you will stumble upon something interesting. Those things can be either a quest, collectable crafting items, various dungeons, enemies, portals, weapons and merchants.I can't put my finger on it but this game truly has something special going for it. There are some downsides I'd like to mention that I wish they were different.First off...while, for the most part, the start of the game as well as the mid-game feels fun, challenging and everything you do is rewarding, the later parts of the game become absurdly difficult in a not-fun way.Vigor is a stat in the game and it's quite important unlike Bloodborne for instance. While Elden Ring provides you with fast moving abilities and spells, it still doesn't match Bloodborne speed....This means that the chances of getting hit are quite high unless you're going out with a shield. The thing is, enemies late game will one - two shot you and it'll make you feel that the effort you've put in the game was for naught.... it's not too bad but it's surely not fun. The exaggerated difficulty spike could've been reduced a little bit by maybe 15-20%. While the bosses are super cool, I found issues with the camera sometimes. Not too big but there are some large bosses that love to fly across your screen. The Lock On system is useless in such situations since it will mess you up. I wished they would innovate this part just a bit and take some risks such as zooming the camera out a bit.The PVP of the game is....not so good....broken builds, 1 shot, cheesing, cheating, the list goes on. You'll either love it and have a huge fun with it or...not care about that at all unless you're invaded while playing co-op. The likeness of this mode depends on the player. I don't mind that it's there, in fact it's good that it's there, it's just not for everyone.

"2014 CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.",csgo nearperfect multiplay shooter unlik previou version often difficult get one offer varieti mode appeal skill level larg commun well support workshop ensur discountpr game around year comein short either play good bad guy must either kill team complet object win round earn money thing faster around year spawn mani imitatorsth game isnt much looker base engin origin half life howev valv polish much commun consist lot awesom mapper churn brilliantli imagin beauti map almost daili basisi worth get alreadi counter strike sourc ye css alway counter strike shoehorn sourc engin csgo feel far like standalon game valv care listen peopl want made appeal game best featur must competit play leav match youll suffer temporari ban featur win mode youll rank pair peopl skill mean game challeng fair regardless skill level match excit occasion scari frustrat reward part game improv rank one satisfi experi video game ever

"What an incredible game. I haven’t felt the want to finish a game that badly in a long time; and do as many of the achievements and things I can along the way. The combat feels great once you understand how to use the different stances together, along with spells and spirits. The story is amazing, and makes me want to watch the 1986 show and listen to the audiobook to really understand everything. That being said, Chapter 6, and one other boss in Chapter 4 are not great. The Scorpionlord, a secret boss in chapter 4, along with the first and the final bosses of the Chapter 6, just feel very unfun. There’s a lot of flying and moving and the game takes what you’ve learned through the entire game and throws it all away and even punishes you for it. Along with that, Chapter 6 feels very unfleshed and is the first instance where you see copy/paste bosses (because they are literally the same), granted they are mini bosses. In any case, I still loved this game and my time with it. I plan on going through and doing at least NG+, as there are a couple missables and I don’t think I’m that tired of the game just yet.I’d rate this a solid 8.5 or 9 out of 10 for me.

"2022 Elden Ring is an open world game set in a world ruled by demigods and populated with beautiful environments and structures, allowing for players to traverse the Lands Between, discovering secrets, engaging in battles, and mayhap get some maidens.There are some problems with the low fps being capped at 60 for PC users but there are solutions on the internet that can help rectify this issue, in addition there is also some fps stuttering at times, it can be annoying but other than that the game is still very much playable. But with that said let us get into what I think is great and what I dislike about Elden Ring.-Enemies-Bosses:The bosses are fantastic looking and have some fantastic flashy move sets, however most of the main bosses have attacks that are too fast to be dodged, insanely long combos, always have some sort of AOE attack, and always keep moving making them hard to hit with melee weapons. Malekith the black blade fits in most of these points vie stated, having ranged abilities, difficult to dodge attacks due to his wide range of attack also making it hard to run away to heal, and a DOT (damage over time) after being hit with his blade. And this trend continues for most of the bosses, making them quite unfun.Giant bosses:Giant bosses are also quite hard to battle against, it's hard to see when they are going to attack IF you’re using melee due to you needing to be up-close to the boss.Duo bosses:Duo bosses are not too fun to fight, considering that they can kill you within 2-4 hits and you now must focus your attention on 2 enemies which considerably increases the difficulty in a cheap way.Enemies:The enemies in this game are fantastic with a wide variety of epic designs making the world feel populated, however some of them are made to be quite annoying, the Rotten Stray constantly staggering you, the Lesser Kindred of Rot with their spammable ranged attack, the Bladed Talon Eagle being hard to hit for melee users and so on.Dungeons:The dungeons are fun areas to explore, containing resources that can help the player out by giving them better weapons or useful materials. However, some of the dungeons have bosses that are too large for the area it is placed in, mostly referring to the Tree Spirit enemies. Fighting in these small rooms is extremely difficult due to the combination of your third person camera, a large boss and a small room, making it quite a challenge to know what is going on, not to mention the AOE attacks this boss has that basically reach the entire room.Too long didn’t read:Bosses are too quick with too many AOE attacks to avoid, a handful of enemies are annoying to fight against, duo bosses are hard to fight without summons but possible, hard to keep track of when giant boss will attack, small areas with big bosses are hard to fight against.-Gameplay-World:The world of Elden Ring is fantastic, not needing to always rush head in towards a boss first, you can always explore and grind levels, get better equipment before trying to battle the bosses, in addition to better equipment, you can also use summons which dramatically makes the fight easier.Combat:The combat in this game is decent, having many different attacks, light attack, heavy attack, rolling light, rolling heavy, jump light, jump heavy, sprinting heavy, sprinting light, guard counter, block, parry, and unique weapon skills that can be applied to each weapon. You can also switch between two handing and one handing weapons as well as dual wielding weapons of the same type as well as mounted combat. There is also the introduction of the stance/posture system. If you are familiar with Sekiro, it is like the posture system. After hitting the enemies enough, it will cause them to stance break and leave them susceptible to critical hits, this is also applicable for bosses too. Some attacks will cause more stance damage than others such as jumping heavy attacks, counter hits and charged heavy attacks.Rolling is a little different in this game, rather than rolling on pressing the button, you roll when the button is released.Runes:Runes from bosses and enemies are a little low. The rune scaling also does not improve much for enemies when you progress to more difficult areas, but bosses do drop more runes. And the runes you get from bosses and enemies are increased permanently after NG+ as well.But aside from all these issues this game is exceptional, one of the best Maiden Pick up simulators I've ever played, a solid 9/10, definitely would recommend to anyone who wants to get into the Souls-like franchise or anyone who is a masochist.",elden ring open world game set world rule demigod popul beauti environ structur allow player travers land discov secret engag battl mayhap get maidensther problem low fp cap pc user solut internet help rectifi issu addit also fp stutter time annoy game still much playabl said let us get think great dislik elden ringenemiesbossesth boss fantast look fantast flashi move set howev main boss attack fast dodg insan long combo alway sort aoe attack alway keep move make hard hit mele weapon malekith black blade fit point vie state rang abil difficult dodg attack due wide rang attack also make hard run away heal dot damag time hit blade trend continu boss make quit unfungi bossesgi boss also quit hard battl hard see go attack your use mele due need upclos bossduo bossesduo boss fun fight consid kill within hit must focu attent enemi consider increas difficulti cheap wayenemiesth enemi game fantast wide varieti epic design make world feel popul howev made quit annoy rotten stray constantli stagger lesser kindr rot spammabl rang attack blade talon eagl hard hit mele user ondungeonsth dungeon fun area explor contain resourc help player give better weapon use materi howev dungeon boss larg area place mostli refer tree spirit enemi fight small room extrem difficult due combin third person camera larg boss small room make quit challeng know go mention aoe attack boss basic reach entir roomtoo long didnt readboss quick mani aoe attack avoid hand enemi annoy fight duo boss hard fight without summon possibl hard keep track giant boss attack small area big boss hard fight againstgameplayworldth world elden ring fantast need alway rush head toward boss first alway explor grind level get better equip tri battl boss addit better equip also use summon dramat make fight easiercombatth combat game decent mani differ attack light attack heavi attack roll light roll heavi jump light jump heavi sprint heavi sprint light guard counter block parri uniqu weapon skill appli weapon also switch two hand one hand weapon well dual wield weapon type well mount combat also introduct stancepostur system familiar sekiro like postur system hit enemi enough caus stanc break leav suscept critic hit also applic boss attack caus stanc damag other jump heavi attack counter hit charg heavi attacksrol littl differ game rather roll press button roll button releasedrunesrun boss enemi littl low rune scale also improv much enemi progress difficult area boss drop rune rune get boss enemi increas perman ng wellbut asid issu game except one best maiden pick simul ive ever play solid definit would recommend anyon want get soulslik franchis anyon masochist

"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Despite the fact that the review is positive, for me it's more of a ""yellow"" type of review (which I hope they will eventually add to Steam, though I’m starting to doubt it). The game looks expensive and polished, it's a good, not overly long action game set in the Warhammer universe, with excellent cutscene direction and beautiful visuals. The combat looks epic, and the gameplay on a gamepad is really well done. The joystick vibrates and even reacts to walking, giving the character in the Space Marine suit a sense of ""weight."" Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 A Screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 By: Wooohooo However, that's where the positives end for me. Here's what really bothered me. First, the combat feels quite repetitive. While smashing enemies is fun in the first few hours, it quickly gets stale and stops being enjoyable. Moreover, I noticed that the difficulty seems a bit broken because on higher difficulty levels, combat turns into an unpleasant mess. You have to constantly spam parries, and even then, enemies will still flank you and ""make your life miserable."" But if you lower the difficulty just one notch, the game becomes too easy and uninteresting. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 A Screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 By: Wooohooo The variety of enemies is small, and they're pretty dull, requiring no special tactics to defeat. The multiplayer PvP mode, by the way, is terrible - I didn't like it at all, and I don't recommend it. It feels like it's just there for the sake of it.The special operations that run parallel to the story can be considered a positive aspect, as they let you try out different Space Marine classes and include some progression. However, they don't add much depth to the game, though they do make it a bit better. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 A Screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 By: Wooohooo For fans of the Warhammer universe or those who just want to switch off their brain and enjoy some action and shooting for a couple of evenings, I would recommend it.

I like the game. The game itself is great except for some balancing and network issues.But the single worst thing is the matchmaking in operations. It is probably the worst Ive ever seen myself.Constantly getting loaded into games with people with the same class ( you only can have 1 of each class) and people changing the mission I originally queued for before starting.

"Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 at launch is a ""good"" video game that feels and looks very ""bad ass"" while playing it but it's also held back pretty hard in my opinion because of feeling very repetitive with gameplay that never really evolves from the first mission to the last. The game has a decent story (singleplayer or co-op) mode, good (co-op) operations and a PVP mode (which is surprisingly good) but the game at launch is missing simple modes like a survival/horde mode which feels like a no brainer for this sort of game so I can't help but feel a little bit disappointed that it's missing (among other things..)It also has some design problems in my opinion when it comes to the shield regenerator ""execute enemy"" system as it makes you compete with your own team mates in co-op about getting health back (if you played it you know what I'm talking about) which doesn't feel intended (but a lot more like a design flaw in the combat and health system)The 6 operations you replay over and over again at launch are not enough.So to keep it (somewhat) short.. As of right now (with the launch content) I'd give it a solid 7.5/10 but it can and likely will easily go up to a 8 or even a 9 with future content. I will definitely play more of the operations and PVP mode but for how much longer I don't know.",warhamm space marin launch good video game feel look bad ass play also held back pretti hard opinion feel repetit gameplay never realli evolv first mission last game decent stori singleplay coop mode good coop oper pvp mode surprisingli good game launch miss simpl mode like survivalhord mode feel like brainer sort game cant help feel littl bit disappoint miss among thingsit also design problem opinion come shield regener execut enemi system make compet team mate coop get health back play know im talk doesnt feel intend lot like design flaw combat health systemth oper replay launch enoughso keep somewhat short right launch content id give solid like easili go even futur content definit play oper pvp mode much longer dont know

"Black Myth: Wukong completely exceeded my expectations. Right from the start, the combat feels sharp and responsive, rewarding both timing and strategy. The variety of environments is staggering—each one is beautifully designed, with its own atmosphere and challenges, keeping the game feeling fresh as you move through different stages. And the boss fights? There are over 90 of them, and they aren’t just there to pad out the game. Each boss is unique and demands real attention, forcing you to adapt and perfect your approach.The skill tree is another standout feature. It’s not just there to unlock a few flashy moves—there's real depth to it. You can build your character in so many different ways, whether you want to focus on raw power, agility, or more technical skills. I loved being able to fine-tune my abilities to fit my playstyle, which made every fight feel different, even after hours of gameplay.Overall, the game kept me completely hooked. It balances challenge and reward perfectly, never feeling unfair but always pushing you to get better. If you're into action RPGs and love the feeling of mastering a complex system, Black Myth: Wukong is an experience you won't want to miss.",black myth wukong complet exceed expect right start combat feel sharp respons reward time strategi varieti environ staggeringeach one beauti design atmospher challeng keep game feel fresh move differ stage boss fight arent pad game boss uniqu demand real attent forc adapt perfect approachth skill tree anoth standout featur unlock flashi movesther real depth build charact mani differ way whether want focu raw power agil technic skill love abl finetun abil fit playstyl made everi fight feel differ even hour gameplayoveral game kept complet hook balanc challeng reward perfectli never feel unfair alway push get better your action rpg love feel master complex system black myth wukong experi wont want miss

"2022 Updated Review:I came back to this game after 9 months and overall I am mildly impressed with the changes. While the game still runs like a turd on my 11700K and RTX 3070 PC, it no longer crashes and there's a lot less bugs, none of which are game-breaking (so far). Plus your mouse now works in 2k/4k fullscreen mode, though I am not sure if they fixed legacy Xbox avatars crashing servers though.They've even improved the interface in a lot of key ways. Once again red means something is being destroyed and green means something is being built on the city screen. Gone are the days of every UI element being red for the heck of it. And, while Immortal Empires is lacking in its beta form, it is there, playable, and fun.If it only ran well I would be extremely impressed. As it is, mildly impressed and I will say it is now worth buying on sale.Old Review:Come back in half a year. Game runs poorly despite hardware that drastically exceeds the recommended spec. If you're on 1440p+ your mouse probably won't work properly in fullscreen mode and windowed mode won't support your resolution so you'll have to play the game in a window that doesn't fill your screen. Then when you actually get to play you'll notice the bugs. Bugs everywhere, terrible performance, if you're on Xbox and have a legacy 360 avatar (mine was a Daedra from Oblivion), it will crash any multiplayer lobby you join as the game can't load legacy Xbox avatars lol. The UI is ugly in general, everything is red so you can't even tell if you're building or destroying something at a glance, and it has its own bugs too—but PCGamer gave the game a 90 and IGN gave it 9/10 so whatever, I'm glad critics enjoy a barely functional game with a staggeringly ugly interface.",updat reviewi came back game month overal mildli impress chang game still run like turd rtx pc longer crash there lot less bug none gamebreak far plu mous work fullscreen mode though sure fix legaci xbox avatar crash server thoughtheyv even improv interfac lot key way red mean someth destroy green mean someth built citi screen gone day everi ui element red heck immort empir lack beta form playabl funif ran well would extrem impress mildli impress say worth buy saleold reviewcom back half year game run poorli despit hardwar drastic exce recommend spec your mous probabl wont work properli fullscreen mode window mode wont support resolut youll play game window doesnt fill screen actual get play youll notic bug bug everywher terribl perform your xbox legaci avatar mine daedra oblivion crash multiplay lobbi join game cant load legaci xbox avatar lol ui ugli gener everyth red cant even tell your build destroy someth glanc bug toobut pcgamer gave game ign gave whatev im glad critic enjoy bare function game staggeringli ugli interfac
"People are dumb thinking the TOS are invasive and that they are only out after your data.

"2016 Since the dawn of time, I have lost hope in fps games and life itself generally because of milked franchises. The sky had no color, food had no flavor. After playing this truly amazing life-altering of a game, I can honestly say I'm a changed man. CS GO has captured my imagination and took me into my unknown sub-conscious. This game has made a profound impact to me. Never before I felt like ripping another human beings head off. Uninstalling, reinstalling became a daily routine for the millionth time because of clueless teammates and their ""cool skins"" (I guess skin > skill matters more).I feel like everyone needs to play this game at least acouple of times because the thrill of clutching, fragging, etc is unlike anything I've experienced. It takes me back to the good old CoD4/ Gears of War/ Battlefield days, having clan battles either GB or underground rules blah blah blah. A true fps that is fun for all ages! For the casual players, you can just have fun with mods and for the competitive, you will def enjoy this. From the ""your mom"" 12yr old squeakers to the maturest people.

Many feel cheap, rather than challenging. Not QUITE Bed of Chaos cheap, but pretty close. I'm feeling like when I die, I didn't cheat the system or find the right cheese rather than build any skill for the next fight. I'm discouraged, I hate the gauntlet of having to dodge 12 times flawlessly and hit once, then repeat... or just summon a bunch of people and cheese the bosses. It's not fun any more.

"2016 Valve turned this game into a sausage fest... with hats.Currently, the game has taken on a F2P/P2W grind-to-collect rare items, playtime incentive system, which gives the game a cheap social-media-tool feel. The 'hat system' is a clear indication that it is time to move on, some 15 years after the creation of the original, and break free of the stale CS formula. Bring something new and engaging to the table... please leave your hats at home.(This game was decent when first it came out and a year or so after - it was a blast teaming up with randoms and making friends to play competitive. The competitive mode really brought the best out of the what the game had to offer.)On the upside, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege may be the answer to the new competitive FPS standard, the breath of fresh air that people have been waiting for.*Please feel free to thumb down this review, if CS:GO is the only game you've ever played*",valv turn game sausag fest hatscurr game taken grindtocollect rare item playtim incent system give game cheap socialmediatool feel hat system clear indic time move year creation origin break free stale cs formula bring someth new engag tabl pleas leav hat homethi game decent first came year blast team random make friend play competit competit mode realli brought best game offeron upsid tom clanci rainbow six sieg may answer new competit fp standard breath fresh air peopl wait forpleas feel free thumb review csgo game youv ever play

"2023 I'm writing this review because CA has gone back to warhammer 1 level of incompetence on this one. I loved Warhammer 1, loved Warhammer 2 much, much more. I had the highest of hopes for Warhammer 3, but so far CA did not provide. The game is stagnant, Warhammer 2 was a constant path of improvement, which, admittedly, did come out as a fairly bad game. The difference however is in the urgency of CA's actions. In Warhammer 2 they released content that was good and did it fast (while also charging reasonable prices for dlcs), Mortal Empires came out much sooner than Immortal Empires. In Warhammer 3 it's been like 1.5 year since launch and the game is very similar to the game at launch. They provided less, improved less and yet charge more while also removing free content. I will change my if at any point I feel like the game has come back on track, but so far I feel like I'm back in Warhammer 1 which I stopped playing after the ridiculous dlcs that were ""The Realm of the Wood Elves"" and ""the Call of the Beastmen"" dlc, which were overpriced (and yet, still cheaper than the new ""just lords"" dlc). When it comes to pricing, just look at the dlc tab, recognize there ain't no more free stuff, and acknowledge the game is rarely getting updates, so it's in a somewhat lackluster state when you realize what it should be at this point",im write review ca gone back warhamm level incompet one love warhamm love warhamm much much highest hope warhamm far ca provid game stagnant warhamm constant path improv admittedli come fairli bad game differ howev urgenc ca action warhamm releas content good fast also charg reason price dlc mortal empir came much sooner immort empir warhamm like year sinc launch game similar game launch provid less improv less yet charg also remov free content chang point feel like game come back track far feel like im back warhamm stop play ridicul dlc realm wood elv call beastmen dlc overpr yet still cheaper new lord dlc come price look dlc tab recogn aint free stuff acknowledg game rare get updat somewhat lacklust state realiz point

"Essentially, I went into this game not knowing what to expect. Be advised, many will cry and complain, disagreeing with my review, but it is 100% honest, and factual. This game offers some of the most fun I have ever had, however I cannot recommend this game to anyone, as it is deceptive. You could spend hundreds of hours grinding, farming, upgrading, collecting Deviants, and it is all for nothing. Apparently at every new season much of what you've worked for, will be removed, Deviants being one of the major ones. Had I known this, I would have never started playing the game. It's as if they're teasing the player or punishing them with that type of system wipe. Most people cannot play games 24/7, and many do not want to farm the same deviants or items over and over again and continue losing them every season. This game has alot of potential, but this is an extreme turn off, and believe me I'm not the only one who feels this way. The combat and harvesting/building bugs are the least of my worries, I accept that all games have bugs, and yes Server lag. I never wanted to leave a review such as this, for a game I loved with a passion starting out. To those involved with this game, production, creation and inception, Starry Studio, NetEase Games, Exptional Global, you're just plain wrong for this. I spent over $100 on the game via microtransactions because I felt you cared about your players, and were offering a solid product.

"2023 EDIT: The overtures made with the Shadows of Change update patch are a nontrivial step in the right direction. The community letter preceding it certainly *sounded* like it was coming from the right place, but the amount of content offered as a free update feels like a commensurate material change for a studio looking to truly change direction. As it stands now, I'm downgrading my outright concern to wariness, but I'm hopeful for where development is headed at this point.See below for my previous concerns.-----------------------------------------------""The right to discuss is a privilege""I normally don't like getting involved in dev drama, but so it goes. The price increase for the DLC didn't bother me at all, but the dev response to recent criticism indicates a level of delusion that doesn't bode well for any aspect of CA's work (development, community engagement, etc.).

"2015 I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons.Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun.Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more?CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience.If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades.Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.)EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins.ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches.Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers.At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches. @Shadowdance You're welcome.

"Servers are not based on players online but on characters created on a server from unique Steam accounts. The devs refuse to kick characters off a server even if they've been inactive for weeks. Because of this, if your friends had a head start on a server, you most likely wouldn't be able to join them because it's permanently full of offline randoms. Joining another server restarts your hard-earned hours of progress, and the server reset time is six weeks.

While I still hold other games in high regard throughout gaming history (Legend of Zelda, Mario, and Mass Effect series for example), Elden Ring is the pinnacle of gaming for me.

2023 Disregarding the overpriced DLC's this is actually a pretty awesome game. Immortal Empires feels like the build-up that the fans deserved. Seeing my dragons get shot by rats with miniguns and dinosaurs wreaking havoc on some poor dwarfs is extremely fun. The sandbox elements are there and the player base seems healthy enough. Multiplayer needs some balancing and an actual ladder system instead of just rankings would be nice. 10/10 will try to 100% achivements.,disregard overpr dlc actual pretti awesom game immort empir feel like buildup fan deserv see dragon get shot rat minigun dinosaur wreak havoc poor dwarf extrem fun sandbox element player base seem healthi enough multiplay need balanc actual ladder system instead rank would nice tri achiv
"A very ambitious, refreshing action-RPG that focuses on cinematic action and hyper dynamic combat while doing away with the usual open world fluff that has gotten way out of control since the mid 2010's.Its a little linear, cut in straightforward chapters and contained areas, almost in a retro / nostalgic way, but it really doesn't miss a beat thanks to stunning, epic cutscenes and frenetic, unique boss fights, constantly pushing the player forwards through the chapters, yearning for more. Sometimes pushing a little too far ahead, to the detriment of the story while at other times offering up some incredible characters and lore along with touching moments... And lots of research to do on Journey to the West and Chinese mythology.Combat is speedy and dynamic although quite precise and usually pretty clean / readable. It sometimes turns messy because of weird camera movements and even weirder hitboxes. A somewhat uneven localisation (at least in English) and a frustrating amount of invisible walls. Definitely old-school .It's spent a long time cooking and ultimately feels like a great first step in Chinese AAA gaming.",ambiti refresh actionrpg focus cinemat action hyper dynam combat away usual open world fluff gotten way control sinc mid littl linear cut straightforward chapter contain area almost retro nostalg way realli doesnt miss beat thank stun epic cutscen frenet uniqu boss fight constantli push player forward chapter yearn sometim push littl far ahead detriment stori time offer incred charact lore along touch moment lot research journey west chines mythologycombat speedi dynam although quit precis usual pretti clean readabl sometim turn messi weird camera movement even weirder hitbox somewhat uneven localis least english frustrat amount invis wall definit oldschool spent long time cook ultim feel like great first step chines aaa game

"2022 In a few words: Amazing, but in moderation.Elden Ring - the latest From Soft entry - entered the gaming scene with one of the biggest hype trains ever seen. Now that the dust has settled at the station, we can mostly agree that the game has definitely lived up to that hype; albeit with a few small caveat. But first, the great: The game is wonderfully illustrated, both with the world building and its inhabitants' design: from the detailed local flora to gigantic enemies, they all feel unique and alive. It is almost guaranteed that players would stop in awe of the surroundings every now and then just to take in the world's grandeur.The NPCs that one meets along their journey also feel very colorfully animated and dynamic, most of which has a semi-hidden questline that the player can follow - as is the tradition of From Soft's games. However do be careful that some of these characters' questlines are either very easy to miss or to be messed up.A bigger world also means a much bigger variety in how the player can build their character. Weapons are definitely the strong suit of the game with one hidden in every nook and canny of the world, awaiting adventurous players seeking off the beaten path. And the special effects of weapons, spells, incantations... in the game feels extremely beautiful and in a way, badass. And now, the the not so good: While beautiful, the game on PC does suffer from performance issues like most From Soft ports to the PC. Patches have been released to iron out major problems but some remain. Most serious for me personally were the random crashes.Enemies do feel unique and boss fights are quite epic, but it is rather unavoidable that a game world of this scale will eventually have to resort to reusing enemies and bosses: turning bosses from early game to later game common enemies and vice versa. Though it does not ruin the experience as a whole, it does a get a little repetitive to see the biome changes but not the enemies we face.This game also has serious balancing issues with most of the later game contents being way overtuned, forcing players to invest heavily into HP in order to just survive from being one-shotted. Some bosses, ahem Malenia, feels very frustrating to fight against due to unfair and unfun mechanic. Some spells that the player can utilize also feels very broken turning some parts of the game a cake walk - but I do tend to stay away from such spells.And finally, with such a size, I do occasionally feel burnt out exploring the world's vastness. And the no hand-holding policy along with intentional vagueness in these games can disorient and discourage newer players from adventuring about. Hence, I found the game most enjoyable in short bursts rather than doing long playthroughs at a time. All in all: The game is great, despite some flaws. It takes all the goodness from previous Soulsbornesekiro titles and mash them together in an open world frame: an unforgettable dish that die-hard and new fans will definitely enjoy.",word amaz moderationelden ring latest soft entri enter game scene one biggest hype train ever seen dust settl station mostli agre game definit live hype albeit small caveat first great game wonder illustr world build inhabit design detail local flora gigant enemi feel uniqu aliv almost guarante player would stop awe surround everi take world grandeurth npc one meet along journey also feel color anim dynam semihidden questlin player follow tradit soft game howev care charact questlin either easi miss mess upa bigger world also mean much bigger varieti player build charact weapon definit strong suit game one hidden everi nook canni world await adventur player seek beaten path special effect weapon spell incant game feel extrem beauti way badass good beauti game pc suffer perform issu like soft port pc patch releas iron major problem remain seriou person random crashesenemi feel uniqu boss fight quit epic rather unavoid game world scale eventu resort reus enemi boss turn boss earli game later game common enemi vice versa though ruin experi whole get littl repetit see biom chang enemi facethi game also seriou balanc issu later game content way overtun forc player invest heavili hp order surviv oneshot boss ahem malenia feel frustrat fight due unfair unfun mechan spell player util also feel broken turn part game cake walk tend stay away spellsand final size occasion feel burnt explor world vast handhold polici along intent vagu game disori discourag newer player adventur henc found game enjoy short burst rather long playthrough time game great despit flaw take good previou soulsbornesekiro titl mash togeth open world frame unforgett dish diehard new fan definit enjoy

"2022 If you like dark souls or any souls like game, play this. If you like breath of the wild or any open world game, play this.Idk, just play this. Give it a chance if you aren't used to this type of gamed.FromSoftware never fails to deliver with the quality of their games. The amount of though that goes into creating the background stories and the environments of this game is unrivalled. This is one of the finest open world games to ever be made. You may be familiar with the classic open world games that studios like ubisoft is making now, go here do this. go there do that. This game is not like that. Exploring is one of the best things about this game and it truly feels rewarding. This game is full of content not just filler. There are so many unique situations that are wonderful. From enemies to friendly npcs and their stories and to weapons there is a huge variety of content. Heck I'm 95 hours in and I havn't finished the game yet but none of it has felt like a chore. I've enjoyed all of it and it 's definitely my favourite game of all time.There are a lot of people getting stuck on this game either saying it's too hard or that it should have a quest log. Some people are seeing the first hard enemy they find and giving up because they can't beat it. You don't have to! It's an important lesson that you can leave that challenge for later and just explore the world. Not having a quest counter makes this game much better. As people have suggested if you really want to you can get a pen and paper to help you remember characters. Don't complain that this is dumb because you aren't in school anymore. I'm sure you can manage. It makes the game so much more natural. You aren't meant to complete quests perfectly and it Isn't really possible to. If you miss a character or a part of a quest it may change other npcs stories in doing so. This makes them so organic and unique to you. You have to puzzle together their dialogue and this world in your own way. If you find something too challenging there is always something else you can try in this game. A different sword, a ranged weapon, magic, a summon, bring a friend along!TLDR: This is one hell of a game with rich and vibrant environments with deep lore. With a lot of it written by George R R Martin adding to even more of what we've come to love from Miyazaki. At it's core this game is an epic fantasy open world with great solid combat and it goes beyond that and is so much more as it's elements have been refined over years of FromSoftware experience.",like dark soul soul like game play like breath wild open world game play thisidk play give chanc arent use type gamedfromsoftwar never fail deliv qualiti game amount though goe creat background stori environ game unrival one finest open world game ever made may familiar classic open world game studio like ubisoft make go go game like explor one best thing game truli feel reward game full content filler mani uniqu situat wonder enemi friendli npc stori weapon huge varieti content heck im hour havnt finish game yet none felt like chore ive enjoy definit favourit game timether lot peopl get stuck game either say hard quest log peopl see first hard enemi find give cant beat dont import lesson leav challeng later explor world quest counter make game much better peopl suggest realli want get pen paper help rememb charact dont complain dumb arent school anymor im sure manag make game much natur arent meant complet quest perfectli isnt realli possibl miss charact part quest may chang npc stori make organ uniqu puzzl togeth dialogu world way find someth challeng alway someth els tri game differ sword rang weapon magic summon bring friend alongtldr one hell game rich vibrant environ deep lore lot written georg r r martin ad even weve come love miyazaki core game epic fantasi open world great solid combat goe beyond much element refin year fromsoftwar experi

"ALMOST 400 HOURS! I have been here since just after inception, almost 400 hours on the game. Uninstalled it yesterday. The wipe and the forced server move and loss of progress, loss of many hours of mats collection and base wipe killed it for me. I don't want to play Tarkov or Rust. This could have been a great game that people could have specialties and go to the market and sell to people. Join strangers in open world and battle with them and be part of helping the working community. The novice servers when it first came out felt like that. So many people giving each other items they needed. Kindness in the chat. People willing to come help you do the Bosses and random people joining you in the open world and hanging out to do things with you for the day.They say this is a MMO game. It's not. They made it seem like essential items from the first season would be able to be transferred to the next season. That is NOT what happens. You are extremely limited to what you can bring over with you and you are basically starting from scratch without the leveled up armor and leveled up weapons you worked hard to get before the wipe. They made it seem like you could bring everything over for the next season and get bigger and better from there. Not so. You start like a noob again, have to level your character up again, don't have access to your blueprints until you have leveled up again and all the additional special items and hoard of mats you farmed the first time don't move over with you. It's insane. Who wants to bother with starting over again and again without being able to bring your progression and skills with you? You are not going into a new season server with your weeks of hard work, you are being thrown into it like a noob. I've put thousands of real hours into many different MMOs, picked my specialty, built my homes, castles, farms etc and carried on in the same fashion without being forced to lose everything. This game is a cash grab for loot crates and cosmetics the way it stands now. The wipes ruin your long term progression. The base you spent hours grinding mats for and making, gone in 6 weeks. The mats you grinded for hours and carefully inventoried in crates, gone in 6 weeks. The farm you made, the meat you dried, the specialty items, gone. The Deviants you upgraded so you could have 20 to help run your base. Gone. The give you a TINY AMOUNT OF ITEMS that can be transferred and even then, you can't use them until you have leveled up from scratch again.This is not an MMO. There is no purpose to try to do anything like you would on an MMO level to have it all removed from you in 6 weeks. The balance on the servers is borked. The FPS is borked. The community became uncomfortable and hostile and rude when the changes were made for hard servers and everyone was struggling with NO MATS OR ITEMS FROM YOUR HOURS OF GAMEPLAY after 6 weeks. The world chat is now full of trolling and abusive players. A massive amount of people left, including my mates, so you now get stuck without anyone you knew from before to play with. Servers became full without many people returning to the server so you couldn't even invite a friend to it. It's just a full server with no one on it now, and no way to invite a friend to it. Customer service is AI, not a human.I don't want to play a MMO that is a RUST or TARKOV server. That is ridiculous. I have no idea why they are saying this is an MMO. It's at best, a slow RPG with massive amounts of anime MMO items (teddy bear costumes, cat tables etc) that are pushed on you all the time. Why would I bother to spend massive amounts of hours trying to get mats to rebuild a home and can't even use my furniture I got because its locked behind my progression again and I don't have the mats to rebuild a home that cannot be rebuilt with your blueprint because you haven't unlocked that ability, that you already had unlocked before the wipe. Absolutely insane.Why would I build an awesome base to have it gone in 6 weeks? Why catch and keep animals only to have it gone in 6 weeks? The whole premise of this game is discombobulated and all over the place. What could have actually been a really pretty MMO with the ability to create your own kind of place in the community has become a loot box mess of a wanna be Rust server with the premise of MMO community that doesn't exist and MMO loot box cosmetics spammed at you all the time.Almost 400 hours. Yes, I played everything, twice. Then I left. I won't go back in the state it is in. The loot boxes, the lack of listening to what the actual game playing community wants and NOT JUST WHAT STREAMERS WANT is bizarre. There is no understanding by the devs that most people do not have 40 hours a week to devote to the game and don't want to come back to something they used their available time for to now suddenly be wiped. It is an epic disappointment in multiple ways. If you like wasting your time on restarting the game from scratch with no carry over progression, over and over again, then enjoy this free game. Otherwise, if they don't make a lot of massive changes to the structure of the game it will be played one time through and dumped.I am not the only one who has expressed these views, there are thousands of us that played and left. I just wanted to say that after almost 400 hours of this game, I'm out. And the people who have also expressed these exact same concerns are also out. This could have been a really nice MMO to explore and grow into.

"2022 For the amount of content promised and actually in the Shadows of Change DLC, which I refuse to buy until sale/price lowering, I'm astounded as to how this company stays in business. I would've been a good consumer and bought it if it were like 8.99 like the Grim and the Grave, because the aforementioned DLC, Shadows of Change, only contains 3 legendary lords for 3 separate and different factions and a handful of units for their factions, along with the subfaction mechanics of each of these three legendary lords.For the layman who doesn't know what I'm talking about:Each legendary lord is one of the playable factions, and usually when legendary lords are made, they arrive in a faction pack or in a style similar to the various smaller Warhammer 2 DLCs, which all pretty much are 10 bucks at most for about 2 new legendary lords, and such. This DLC in particular should be priced as such. The Chaos Dwarf DLC for this game was a one-off price-spike that also has been met with mixed reviews as well.If Creative Assembly wants to survive, they better start going back in the direction of their Vampire Coast and Tomb Kings DLCs where they gave an entire faction (a full unit roster, 3 legendary lords, an entire campaign fully voiced and designed for the faction. (This was especially prevalent in the Vampire Coast DLC) for at most, 18.99, not just 3 dudes and a handful of units for the same price plus about five bucks (24.99).In addition, alot of the content from the WH1 and WH2 DLCs, and even base-games is missing in WH3, such as the various campaign scenarios from WH1, the WH2 cutscenes and other campaign content for the Vampire Coast, which should come with the WH3 version of the DLC, because that's one of the cornerstones for buying the DLC in the first place. Now I know everyone in WH2 loved Mortal Empires, but I believe I have a legit point here, regarding the fact that alot of content is just straight up missing.Settlement buildings for various occupied variants of important capitals aren't present (they're just the generic occupied ones). Various landmark buildings aren't even in warhammer 3, such as Cylostra's Opera House. (Come on CA you literally made the character you can move her landmark building anywhere, nobody is going to whine about that) In essence, this can be seen as a gigantic money laundering scheme more-so than a company-fanbase relationship, and I'm afraid it's only going to get worse.Total War is on life-support and Total War Warhammer's DLC policies have put it there. This throwing 24.99 DLC crap at us isn't going to make anything better, come on CA, you're not Paradox Interactive, you don't need to nickel and dime us for ♥♥♥♥ we already get nickeled and dimed for on Games Workshop's various legitimate retailing locations and websites to buy the actual figures for the tabletop game that this is based on.You need to invest in new mechanics eventually, CA, and we're not talking Legendary Lord mechanics, we're talking legitimately changes to the actual gameplay. People are literally calling Total War: Troy and Total War: Warhammer the same freaking game, because there's very little difference other than unit roster and one being a Games Workshop licensed game. Empire had special buildings all over its provinces, Shogun dipped heavily into Daiymo diplomacy and improved on what Empire started in terms of the varying differences on the map. Everytime Creative Assembly ♥♥♥♥♥ up a game they release a ""fixed"" differently named version slightly altered formula game later. For example: Rome 2 and then Attila. It's starting to get very grating.Bretonnian Cavalry doesn't even compare to that of earlier Total War Titles cavalry, Total War: Attila was the last game where it felt like cavalry charges mattered.And now Creative Assembly is charging an upwards of 24.99 for a freaking DLC when their games are pretty much now prefabbed on the same cavalry-hating engine, for literal years.This is on the same engine as Total War: Empire. Let that sink in. And now they want to release Total War: Pharaoh on the same engine. Give me a break. I'm actually more invested in literally any other title at this point, and I feel like my money is being wasted on empty promises of ""we hear you, we hear you"" and then not a single price-change in sight.

"If you've watched any content on the game whatsoever, that is the game you are getting. No smokes and mirrors. (But I'd still hope you're properly informed on the scope of the game as a whole)I've had this game on my radar for almost 3 years, was somewhat concerned when it got delayed a year but man am I incredibly happy they decided to because this game feels insanely polished. I played this game solely in low graphics for the entire main campaign and it still is one of the most atmospheric and gorgeous games I've ever played. If you're familiar with Warhammer 40k in any capacity (or are somewhat of a tourist that knows some lore tidbits like myself) and you love the aesthetic and have wished for so long for a sort of immersive experience that takes place in the franchise's world in a form that ISN'T a turn based game; this is a must buy, instantly. The campaign was amazing, around 8-9 hours of content but it felt perfect for me, not too short, not too bloated. And the finale just drove me over the edge, genuinely such an incredible high note to add on with plenty of fan-service that satisfied me and will surely make a bunch of loreheads incredibly excited and happy to see through.Very small complaints, it would seem the game is generally scaled for 3 individual players given that the bot companions are actually not very useful at all! My recommendation if you're getting into the game with your friends is to go into veteran difficulty and experience the game that way, but I'd advise against higher difficulties solo. It's not impossible, just feels overwhelming when the enemies don't ever focus anyone but you and you're tasked with just using the best gear, leaving no real room for customization or experimentation (when it's your first time playing through the game). Aside from that, not much else that I care about, oh aside from the final boss seemingly not letting you go in with your preferred loadout in the main campaign? Seemingly the only place that happens and I'm not sure if it's intentional. Granted I played this over the course of the first day for ultra and gold edition owners so this will surely get patched out in a week or less.Oh and operations are incredibly cool and will be a lot of the replayability for many players with how you can customize your own class specific space marine in SO MANY LEVELS of fashion. I'm still waiting on my friends to get on since they only got the base game without the headstart, but I'm excited to play through these missions with them.Last notes, I do wish you had some kinds of Chaos customization but I'm not damaged in any way that it isn't there. Also there is going to be a lot more content coming out in at least the next year and a half, the developers have actively released a roadmap explaning the addition of full on enemy classes and operation missions ENTIRELY FREE, with the only paid DLC coming in the form cosmetics, plus talks of adding full on playable classes in the future? We'll see if that talk actually goes anywhere but I can't say the idea of it doesn't have me thrilled.As it stands now, I've yet to 100% the game and excited that I have plenty to experience and unlock. I'm extremely grateful for everyone involved in creating this product (that was clearly made for me since it comes out officially on the day I was born!), and I'm excited to see what comes in the future of this great game!",youv watch content game whatsoev game get smoke mirror id still hope your properli inform scope game wholeiv game radar almost year somewhat concern got delay year man incred happi decid game feel insan polish play game sole low graphic entir main campaign still one atmospher gorgeou game ive ever play your familiar warhamm capac somewhat tourist know lore tidbit like love aesthet wish long sort immers experi take place franchis world form isnt turn base game must buy instantli campaign amaz around hour content felt perfect short bloat final drove edg genuin incred high note add plenti fanservic satisfi sure make bunch lorehead incred excit happi see throughveri small complaint would seem game gener scale individu player given bot companion actual use recommend your get game friend go veteran difficulti experi game way id advis higher difficulti solo imposs feel overwhelm enemi dont ever focu anyon your task use best gear leav real room custom experiment first time play game asid much els care oh asid final boss seemingli let go prefer loadout main campaign seemingli place happen im sure intent grant play cours first day ultra gold edit owner sure get patch week lessoh oper incred cool lot replay mani player custom class specif space marin mani level fashion im still wait friend get sinc got base game without headstart im excit play mission themlast note wish kind chao custom im damag way isnt also go lot content come least next year half develop activ releas roadmap explan addit full enemi class oper mission entir free paid dlc come form cosmet plu talk ad full playabl class futur well see talk actual goe anywher cant say idea doesnt thrilleda stand ive yet game excit plenti experi unlock im extrem grate everyon involv creat product clearli made sinc come offici day born im excit see come futur great game

"Fascinating game by Game Science! This is the first ever Journey To the West related game I've ever played and so far being surprised on how well this game is doing. Firstly, the gameplay is one of the best part of this game. There are lots of system to play with regarding the transformation, spell and heavy attack options. Each skills have their own purpose and can be use in diffferent situations, offer large flexibility and a whole lot of fun to play. The monsters are considered hard, but with proper use of these systems, you can pass it quite easily. 9.5/10 for gameplay.Next, the story is very good and deep. It is about the after story of the Journey To the West. We can have a different view aside form the main story and it focus about the darkside regarding the story of Journey to the West. The story are well written and presented in a cinematic form, which greatly helps in immersive experience. After each chapter, there is also a short drawing animations that present and summarize the background story of the current chapter or might highly relevant to the other chapter, which even make you more interested in what will happen next. The game also gives you a menu list of enemies that you fought or person that you met along the journey, along with a long background information. The musics are also very well chosen and suits the situation well, especially the musics after the transformation, definitely will lit you up. 9/10 for story and music.However, this game also content of some downside that might ruin your experience, and the most mentioned will definitely be the map. There are NO mini map in this game, making it a very hard time for me to memorize and walk around the map without any idea where am I going. The graphics and views of the game is good with the help of unreal 5 engine, but sometimes I might experience lag spike when playing with monsters that have lots of effect, like fire or lightning, which might destroy your gaming experience. The cameras are also very frustrating, especially when playing against large monsters or in small spaces. These are the spots that might need further improvement or optimization.Overall, this is a fantastic games with interesting gameplay, graphics, stories and music. There are flaws in this game, but the goods overshine the bads and gives me a very good experience. To be mentioned, there are alot of side quest and hidden boss in this game, which you can find out if you miss any boss in the enemy list, make sure you run through the whole map patiently to not miss any good contents.

"Per usual, there's nitpick and ganging up over the smallest of things in reviews without people reading into it or actually taking the time to experience it. There's pros and cons, like any other games.This is a Free to Play. I am astounded by the character customization that we get in comparison to games you have to buy. There's a decent amount of content and places to explore and fun little things to collect - a LOT more than many of those ""early release"" games you buy can claim. This game isn't completed in just 6 hours or less and new content continues to be released at a decent pace before you can finish the current content (or at least for me). It's enough for me to comment to myself ""This is a free game?"" with each new feature that astounds me. Better yet: it's not pay to win.Now.. The enemies are a bit easy in the starting zone, which can make the pace feel slow or the combat a little dull. The base building could also use some touch up in how the pieces snap together (i.e. the curved crescent shape snapping to the underside of ceilings), but otherwise has been enjoyable once you can move your base away from the first zone (where everyone is heavily crowded). I am also a little iffy with the seasonal resets, as my play is so limited between work and family and I feel I might not reach the end before reset happens.Maybe I've been a little starved for a finished game, tired as hell of all those paid ""early release"" with slow moving promises. But this is still a breath of fresh air and worth giving a chance.",per usual there nitpick gang smallest thing review without peopl read actual take time experi there pro con like gamesthi free play astound charact custom get comparison game buy there decent amount content place explor fun littl thing collect lot mani earli releas game buy claim game isnt complet hour less new content continu releas decent pace finish current content least enough comment free game new featur astound better yet pay winnow enemi bit easi start zone make pace feel slow combat littl dull base build could also use touch piec snap togeth ie curv crescent shape snap undersid ceil otherwis enjoy move base away first zone everyon heavili crowd also littl iffi season reset play limit work famili feel might reach end reset happensmayb ive littl starv finish game tire hell paid earli releas slow move promis still breath fresh air worth give chanc

"2022 Ive played every soulsborne game to date, this is by far the best game they have put out. It takes all the great things from previous games and mashes it into an ultimate experience that just feels good all around. The story has been hitting hard and has a lot more dialogue and interactive story for you to have fun with. As well as brings back some relics from past games. All while feeling new and fresh. This game isnt perfect by any means, it has its minor glitches and stutters but nothing I haven't seen worse on any other game, and most of those issues can easily be patched out. Its a game I have already sunk 55 hours into as of writing this review and I have only reached a little over the halfway point in the game with so much more to explore.TLDR: If you enjoy previous FromSoft games you will love how this game feels and plays, if not but are looking for a game that rewards persistence and drive maybe give it a shot. If not it may not be the game for you and thats alright not everything will be.

"2023 Since the release of Skyrim on 11/11/11 I have been craving an open world experience with rewarding combat, build theories, crazy-beautiful aesthetics, and a real sense of accomplishment (items, dungeons completed, etc).This game delivers the entire experience in a way I've never quite seen. I'm new to the souls-like genre, and FROMSOFTWARE games. Here are the takeaways for me: 1. Combat is extremely rewarding by being unforgiving. At first glance, it's hard, but as you delve just a little deeper you realize that combat in this game is an art form that takes practice, and then more practice. The satisfaction is higher than any game I've played in the last decade. The light attacks, heavy attacks, blocks, parrying, sprint attacks, sneak attacks, all play a little different and allow you to really pick your method or avenue of approach. 2. Items in game (from armor and weapons, to craftables and ashes) are each, individually, potentially game changing or build changing and can really flesh out a 'build'. It's rewarding to find items in game as any one of them could be the weapon of choice for your desired build. 3. Open world is absolutely stunning and feels very scary, yet very exciting. Every new enemy seen needs to be studied, practiced, and learned for optimal combat. New enemies can be scary as you don't immediately know their capabilities. Boss fights are hard (some more than others) and many enemies are the type that require you to come back at a later time when you have stronger tools, or more HP, or you git gud. Roaming new areas is thrilling and you begin to truly have to balance and manage your HP, FP, and Stamina while in combat. The lighting in caves with torches or lanterns is immersive and you feel the danger.4. Character building is straightforward. You level up as you beat enemies and use the runes (XP, currency) as you see fit to either purchase things, or level up....etc and you can decide what attribute to increase. Trying new weapons, new armors, is both fun and interesting. The need to knows: 1. Game won't hold your hand. You are in a labyrinth with many things that all can kill you. You will not know exactly what you're doing, where you're going, or why you are existing. 2. Everything you see can kill you if you become too careless. Slow and steady usually is the best method. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.3. Ashes of War, summoning and crafting must be experimented with to understand. Again, no hand holding.4. You will ask yourself, ""How in the world am I supposed to ever be able to complete this?"" Many, many times.5. Puzzles and secrets abound, exploration and a good memory are key. 6. While there is a multiplayer experience (PVP and PVE) it's a bit confusing and from what I've experienced so far, not necessarily mandatory. The single player experience is strong with this one.I've spent 42 hours in this game as of writing this and I've barely left the starting area - Limgrave. My nightmares consist of Runebears, traversing the mist, and boss fights. I've been startled, pillaged, rekt, and absolutely confused many times, but I wouldn't change any of it. I remember the first time I saw a giant I had Attack on Titan flashbacks and began trying to summon my inner Captain Levi. It's just a blast. An absolute blast. The greatest feeling of accomplishment is when you start to beat bosses or new enemies on your first attempt. You can feel your ability, your reaction time, your muscle-memory coming more and more into play as you practice, and it creates a thrilling experience. Struggling with an enemy type for hours only to come back a few days later and realize how much stronger and faster you've gotten is a very rewarding experience.",sinc releas skyrim crave open world experi reward combat build theori crazybeauti aesthet real sens accomplish item dungeon complet etcthi game deliv entir experi way ive never quit seen im new soulslik genr fromsoftwar game takeaway combat extrem reward unforgiv first glanc hard delv littl deeper realiz combat game art form take practic practic satisfact higher game ive play last decad light attack heavi attack block parri sprint attack sneak attack play littl differ allow realli pick method avenu approach item game armor weapon craftabl ash individu potenti game chang build chang realli flesh build reward find item game one could weapon choic desir build open world absolut stun feel scari yet excit everi new enemi seen need studi practic learn optim combat new enemi scari dont immedi know capabl boss fight hard other mani enemi type requir come back later time stronger tool hp git gud roam new area thrill begin truli balanc manag hp fp stamina combat light cave torch lantern immers feel charact build straightforward level beat enemi use rune xp currenc see fit either purchas thing level upetc decid attribut increas tri new weapon new armor fun interest need know game wont hold hand labyrinth mani thing kill know exactli your your go exist everyth see kill becom careless slow steadi usual best method slow smooth smooth ash war summon craft must experi understand hand ask world suppos ever abl complet mani mani puzzl secret abound explor good memori key multiplay experi pvp pve bit confus ive experienc far necessarili mandatori singl player experi strong oneiv spent hour game write ive bare left start area limgrav nightmar consist runebear travers mist boss fight ive startl pillag rekt absolut confus mani time wouldnt chang rememb first time saw giant attack titan flashback began tri summon inner captain levi blast absolut blast greatest feel accomplish start beat boss new enemi first attempt feel abil reaction time musclememori come play practic creat thrill experi struggl enemi type hour come back day later realiz much stronger faster youv gotten reward experi

"2022 I got my brother in to playing this game. Which is not much of a feat but he seemed dead set against playing a ""Souls"" game. To be honest, I'm no fan of Souls games either. But the RPG aspect gave me enough hope to give it a try. So far I have cursed out loud more times than I care to admit. This can get real embarassing when you are living in a hotel for work purposes and you come out of your room and people are just like ""What the hell man."" My brother summed this up this game perfectly. ""Skyrim on insane difficulty."" This is the highest praise I think he's given anything. If you haven't picked up this game and you are thinking, I don't like Souls games. Take heart. This has souls like aspects but it is NOT a Souls game. This is a VERY good RPG pretending to be a souls game.If you took an RPG and took out all the hand holding and FETCH QUESTS, then ramped up the difficulty, took away the easy mode indicators (Oh, he's level 40 I should wait) and said do what ever you want. You would get close to this game.Graphicly superior to many games I've played recently. There are still some funny ""graphical"" situations. Things like ""Don't look at the trees too much in the wind. They look like giant dusters all moving randomly."" Though I don't buy RPGs for graphics alone, I do expect that modern RPGs have modern graphics. There is no real reason for 8bit characters when the world is capable of so much better. Sorry, small tangent.Sounds, including music are well thought out and placed. I normally turn the music in games right off. This game I leave it on. The music is subtle almost not there but it adds to the atmosphere rather then distract from it. Many times I only realise there was music after I've died (most likely) or I won the fight(I'm getting better but this is still the lesser).The last thing I say is don't be disheartened when you die. It WILL happen. You will lose a LOT of runes. This game makes you ""Git Gud"". Time and again I've fallen to the same enemy but the joy you feel when you defeat them. Unmatched in ANY game I've ever played. You feel like you've actually accomplished something.If you like RPGs (especially the old style where you didn't have your hand held the whole way) buy this game. You may curse me in your sleep but you will enjoy yourself.",got brother play game much feat seem dead set play soul game honest im fan soul game either rpg aspect gave enough hope give tri far curs loud time care admit get real embarass live hotel work purpos come room peopl like hell man brother sum game perfectli skyrim insan difficulti highest prais think he given anyth havent pick game think dont like soul game take heart soul like aspect soul game good rpg pretend soul gameif took rpg took hand hold fetch quest ramp difficulti took away easi mode indic oh he level wait said ever want would get close gamegraphicli superior mani game ive play recent still funni graphic situat thing like dont look tree much wind look like giant duster move randomli though dont buy rpg graphic alon expect modern rpg modern graphic real reason charact world capabl much better sorri small tangentsound includ music well thought place normal turn music game right game leav music subtl almost add atmospher rather distract mani time realis music ive die like fightim get better still lesserth last thing say dont dishearten die happen lose lot rune game make git gud time ive fallen enemi joy feel defeat unmatch game ive ever play feel like youv actual accomplish somethingif like rpg especi old style didnt hand held whole way buy game may curs sleep enjoy

so far ive been enjoying the game. ive had a friend help me a bit seeing as this isnt my usual game but for someone who doesnt normally play open world games...well outside of 7 days. I caught on pretty quickly so far with little to no help. It also runs perfect no issues or crashes so far and ive been enjoying it!! I def rec trying it. Its free no reason not to. Especially when I have no downsides to add as of yet. You originally couldnt play multiple characters and they changed that very quickly. So Im hoping people will change their negative reviews. I dont believe the game deserves that.,far ive enjoy game ive friend help bit see isnt usual game someon doesnt normal play open world gameswel outsid day caught pretti quickli far littl help also run perfect issu crash far ive enjoy def rec tri free reason especi downsid add yet origin couldnt play multipl charact chang quickli im hope peopl chang neg review dont believ game deserv

"2022 Edit: The release of IE fixed one of the most glaring problems with the game - and the new Warriors of Chaos rework is loads of fun. The release - for me at least - is stable and relatively bug-free. I am therefore changing my recommendation. Se below for the old review.Don't buy this game as of yet - come back and check again in 2023...The current campaign is riddled with odd design decisions and bugs that could have been avoided by looking at Warhammer 2 for 30 seconds. For example: Why are there issues with unit responsiveness and missile targeting when it worked fine in Warhammer 2? Why is the performance on the campaign map WAY worse, to the point where one of my friends couldn't even run the damned thing, when Warhammer 2 ran perfectly fine on medium/high?(while 3K and Troy ran buttery smooth) Why did they look at the slightly railroaded Vortex campaign, see that it was nowhere near as popular as the Mortal empires campaign and think: ""The solution must be to make the new campaign even more railroaded!""?Now I would have forgiven the campaign side of things, because I was confident that we would soon get the Immortal empires combined campaign, but as it turns out, it is nowhere near completed. They only comitted to releasing a BETA version of it (I.e. probably barely functioning version), possibly as late as september.. god knows how long it will take for the full release. I have paid full price, three times to get that combined map, and all they can muster is to wait several months to tell me, that I have to wait for several more months to get to BETA test what was promised and what I paid top dollar for? The changes they are working on are promising and needed, but they are being implemented WAY too slowly. It really sucks because there are so many good moves in the game: Better diplomacy, better siegemaps, 8 player campaign multiplayer with simultaneous turns to name a few! But if you don't feel like playing the campaign, these don't matter much. I wish the DLC team the best of luck with Warhammer 3, because they did a sterling job on Warhammer 2 post launch.",edit releas ie fix one glare problem game new warrior chao rework load fun releas least stabl rel bugfre therefor chang recommend se old reviewdont buy game yet come back check current campaign riddl odd design decis bug could avoid look warhamm second exampl issu unit respons missil target work fine warhamm perform campaign map way wors point one friend couldnt even run damn thing warhamm ran perfectli fine mediumhighwhil troy ran butteri smooth look slightli railroad vortex campaign see nowher near popular mortal empir campaign think solut must make new campaign even railroadednow would forgiven campaign side thing confid would soon get immort empir combin campaign turn nowher near complet comit releas beta version ie probabl bare function version possibl late septemb god know long take full releas paid full price three time get combin map muster wait sever month tell wait sever month get beta test promis paid top dollar chang work promis need implement way slowli realli suck mani good move game better diplomaci better siegemap player campaign multiplay simultan turn name dont feel like play campaign dont matter much wish dlc team best luck warhamm sterl job warhamm post launch
"This is a great ARPG and probably one of the better GoTY candidates. The overall experience is let down by some questionable control input delay/unresponsiveness mechanics and less polished last chapter.If I can only describe this game in a sentence, then Black Myth Wukong is ’a reflection of a labour of love and reverence paid to THE ORIGINAL Chinese mythology that is Journey to the West. Throughout most of the gameplay you can feel the reverence & details the devs put into this game.’ I absolutely recommend this game if you enjoyed Seikiro, Devil May Cry, Nioh series, GoW, Lords of the Fallen, Nier Automata series etc. This game builds on the legacies of others but also proudly stands out as the one of the most memorable ARPGs for me in recent years after 70+ hours.Key Things to Note1) Black Myth Wukong is a very carefully composed, curated and guided linear/semi open world experience. You have options to explore untrodden paths but eventually all paths lead back to one. 2) It enhances your game experience to actually know some background context about the Chinese mythology that is ‘Journey to the West.’ Black Myth Wukong takes place AFTER the original events of Journey to the West with plenty of liberal interpretation & further new world building based on a version of the Monkey King. 3) The game is best when your mid way through but falls flat & rushed at the last chapter. There’s not many reviews that talk about polish of this game near the end but it’s bad. The assets/terrain look like placeholders, you can pass though solid objects like trees/NPCs… The feeling of rush to the finish is very distinct and is extremely jarring compared to chapters 1-5.4) This game rewards adaptive gameplay (freely respec skills & your gear), iteration (learning boss mechanics through failure) & exploration (methodical slow play). The game plot often interweaves through side quests & seemingly random encounters with lots of hidden information that requires reading text via in-game journal tab. The English translation is not good and overall story telling can be obfuscated and full of riddles adversely impacted by translation issues.5) You need to retain most in-game events in your memory bank and connect fair amount of dots throughout your play through. Chapters whilst self contained has overarching connected side quests, world events, where even seemingly random picked up item hold important core narrative lore to add context. There’s also numerous NPC background stories that all contribute to different game outcomes & also help explain the overall story. E.g. a hidden zone in Chapter 2 with associated boss fight and story is directly tied to end event of Chapter 2 bringing a more fulfilling conclusion to Chapter 2 arc whilst also hinting at the constant time shift mechanic employed in this game’s story telling.6) There’s issues with how this game process player control input. There’s some issues with general input lag and how the game fails to register input due to animations locks out input even after animation seemingly completes. Best example is gourd use is mostly able to be triggered even between dodges or attacks. Medicines cannot. Taking medicine requires player to stand perfectly still with no player animation happening or other input.7) I also have this game on my PS5, my kid plays that mainly so as to not have my PC save file accidentally erased. PS5 version is definitely playable including PS Portal via remote play.Detailed ReviewStory/setting/visual: Very good story with Chinese voice over better than English (more nuance in the emotions conveyed - I keep English subtitles so I can keep up). To enjoy this game you need to have some cultural awareness, English/Chinese listening aptitude is essential (if you don’t want to rely on subtitles) yet bulk of the context to what plays out in this game is gathered through text as well. I give overall story 8/10 but YMMV especially if you don’t take time to fully comprehend the side stories including boss lore & tying it so together for yourself.Technical performance: I'm playing across range of PC hardware including at 1440p/4K with maxed out settings including ray tracing at Very High and everything on cinematic with DLSS at 75%. I average 80~120fps+ in-game with uncommon dips below 80fps with peaks around 125+fps. This is on a RTX4090M + 13900HX laptop as my desktop PC is currently out of action. I also play this on Legion Go (1200p) & tried on Asus Rog Ally (1080p)… Both played fine with FSR/XeSS at 40-50%, low-medium settings yielding 30~55fps in game without frame gen. On AMD hardware if you have anti-lag & AFMF toggled on via AMD Adrenaline software, it can cause severe stuttering issues in-game especially in Chapters 3 & 4. Chapter 3 is also less performant than all chapters with overall average fps dropping by 10-20% easily. There’s UE5 traversal stutters but this game at v1.0 launch is in a better technical state than most other UE5 games I’ve played. This game at launch is also playable & actually enjoyable (not something that can be taken for granted in modern AAA releases). Remember Game Science started with 7 devs in 2017, started really recruiting people after 2020, worked through COVID in China, never developed AAA level ARPG games and with barely any experience across the team has managed to deliver a product at v1.0 that is almost on par with the likes of GoW with a captivating world, better overall graphics & an original story setting.Game content, variety & depth: in my first 70+ hours I thoroughly enjoyed chapters 1-5. Chapter 6 is by far the worst and is actually subpar below AAA level due to lack of polish, glitches, enemy hitbox issues, low fidelity assets, boring level design (bland copy and paste to create false sense of scale - due to flying ability).As for lore; if you’re not reading at a minimum the character description scrolls after defeating each one, you’re losing out on critical lore & often interesting background. E.g. the 3 rat princes backstory if you read it (take you maybe 2-3 mins max) offers a great insight into why they act the at they do when you encounter them and made my experience more fulfilling after defeating them as more than just a boss rush.Controversy around this game : We seem to be trending towards more expensive game development but less value offered to customers with missing content, lack of variety/depth of content and even content locked behind day 1 DLCs. This includes games like Jedi Survivor, Starwars Outlaw & Space Marines 2 which shows how widely the industry has shifted in favour of monetisation above core game value. Often it’s more important how diverse a game appears with in-game NPCs rather than the diversity that matters like actual human beings that worked on the project, cultural representation etc. E,g. People should Google the English VAs that was paid and worked on Black Myth Wukong where they even had females play as male & deity type NPCs etc. The diversity of the VA cast and the dev team is overshadowed because of the ridiculous manufactured outrage over either mis-translations of embellished social media posts from years past or outright defamation by biased and inaccurate gaming ‘journalism,’ gobbled up by swaths of the public that are either misinformed or uninformed.Also those people that hate, review bomb or boycotting this game without even owning/trying this game because it’s Chinese developers is about as vile as it seems. There’s no justification for generalisation or bias confirmation. The devs have harmed no one in making and releasing this game. Buy this game if logic, real life diversity, cultural value, great gameplay & value for money appeals to you.",great arpg probabl one better goti candid overal experi let question control input delayunrespons mechan less polish last chapterif describ game sentenc black myth wukong reflect labour love rever paid origin chines mytholog journey west throughout gameplay feel rever detail dev put game absolut recommend game enjoy seikiro devil may cri nioh seri gow lord fallen nier automata seri etc game build legaci other also proudli stand one memor arpg recent year hourskey thing black myth wukong care compos curat guid linearsemi open world experi option explor untrodden path eventu path lead back one enhanc game experi actual know background context chines mytholog journey west black myth wukong take place origin event journey west plenti liber interpret new world build base version monkey king game best mid way fall flat rush last chapter there mani review talk polish game near end bad assetsterrain look like placehold pass though solid object like treesnpc feel rush finish distinct extrem jar compar chapter game reward adapt gameplay freeli respec skill gear iter learn boss mechan failur explor method slow play game plot often interweav side quest seemingli random encount lot hidden inform requir read text via ingam journal tab english translat good overal stori tell obfusc full riddl advers impact translat need retain ingam event memori bank connect fair amount dot throughout play chapter whilst self contain overarch connect side quest world event even seemingli random pick item hold import core narr lore add context there also numer npc background stori contribut differ game outcom also help explain overal stori eg hidden zone chapter associ boss fight stori directli tie end event chapter bring fulfil conclus chapter arc whilst also hint constant time shift mechan employ game stori there issu game process player control input there issu gener input lag game fail regist input due anim lock input even anim seemingli complet best exampl gourd use mostli abl trigger even dodg attack medicin take medicin requir player stand perfectli still player anim happen also game kid play mainli pc save file accident eras version definit playabl includ ps portal via remot playdetail reviewstorysettingvisu good stori chines voic better english nuanc emot convey keep english subtitl keep enjoy game need cultur awar englishchines listen aptitud essenti dont want reli subtitl yet bulk context play game gather text well give overal stori ymmv especi dont take time fulli comprehend side stori includ boss lore tie togeth yourselftechn perform im play across rang pc hardwar includ max set includ ray trace high everyth cinemat dlss averag ingam uncommon dip peak around laptop desktop pc current action also play legion go tri asu rog alli play fine fsrxess lowmedium set yield game without frame gen amd hardwar antilag afmf toggl via amd adrenalin softwar caus sever stutter issu ingam especi chapter chapter also less perform chapter overal averag fp drop easili there travers stutter game launch better technic state game ive play game launch also playabl actual enjoy someth taken grant modern aaa releas rememb game scienc start dev start realli recruit peopl work covid china never develop aaa level arpg game bare experi across team manag deliv product almost par like gow captiv world better overal graphic origin stori settinggam content varieti depth first hour thoroughli enjoy chapter chapter far worst actual subpar aaa level due lack polish glitch enemi hitbox issu low fidel asset bore level design bland copi past creat fals sens scale due fli abilitya lore your read minimum charact descript scroll defeat one your lose critic lore often interest background eg rat princ backstori read take mayb min max offer great insight act encount made experi fulfil defeat boss rushcontroversi around game seem trend toward expens game develop less valu offer custom miss content lack varietydepth content even content lock behind day dlc includ game like jedi survivor starwar outlaw space marin show wide industri shift favour monetis core game valu often import divers game appear ingam npc rather divers matter like actual human be work project cultur represent etc eg peopl googl english va paid work black myth wukong even femal play male deiti type npc etc divers va cast dev team overshadow ridicul manufactur outrag either mistransl embellish social media post year past outright defam bias inaccur game journal gobbl swath public either misinform uninformedalso peopl hate review bomb boycot game without even owningtri game chines develop vile seem there justif generalis bia confirm dev harm one make releas game buy game logic real life divers cultur valu great gameplay valu money appeal
"The gameplay is enjoyable and as of level 15 in game I still don't feel like a f2p player so that's something but it is still early.The game is in dire need of optimization though as frame drops and input delay can get unbearable very often, it'll run completely smooth for an hour then be unplayably laggy the next all while server ping is stable.My pc isn't top of the line but it is better than what's recommended and I am playing with very low setting.It made a big difference to run the game on DX11 through the -d3d11 steam launch parameters and locking fps to 30 somehow which is odd because it really doesn't seem locked to 30 fps when the option is set.There's a lot they could massively improve but the game has a solid core and feels more complete than D4 did on launch.",gameplay enjoy level game still dont feel like player that someth still earlyth game dire need optim though frame drop input delay get unbear often itll run complet smooth hour unplay laggi next server ping stablemi pc isnt top line better what recommend play low settingit made big differ run game steam launch paramet lock fp somehow odd realli doesnt seem lock fp option setther lot could massiv improv game solid core feel complet launch
"So, after a year of subjecting myself to this game – and trust me, 'game' is a generous term – I've come to the conclusion that debating whether a group of koalas could do better is a legitimate argument. And forget about comparing it to classics like CS:GO; this game is like comparing a tricycle to a Ferrari.Picture this: You're spraying bullets left, right, and center, missing every hit and suddenly, you've got a team full of Russians offering you extremely positive criticism. It's like being in a tutorial for 'How Not to Play.'And the thrill of victory? Oh boy, it's a wild ride. Win a match, and you're rewarded with a whopping 100 elo points. Lose? Well, say goodbye to those points faster than you can say 'disconnect.'Now, let's talk about the PC requirements. You could have a PC that costs more than a small country's GDP, and this game will still make it perform like it's powered by hamsters on a wheel. Lag? It's not a bug; it's a feature. Let`s focus on the positive:The anti-cheat system – it's a masterpiece of nothingness! There's only a 7% chance you'll face off against someone who's downloaded every cheat code known to mankind. And those players with 600-1500 hours? They're like gaming gods, smiting 15-20.000 hour mere mortals with every click of their mouse.So, if you enjoy subjecting yourself to digital torture, I highly recommend giving this game a try.

"2023 Total Warhammer 3 is an impressive game. It offers hundreds of hours of entertainment. The scope of the game is simply staggering. The Warhammer fantasy world is available to you in a sandbox campaign for you to paint the map with a diverse selection of factions that play uniquely in both campaign as well as in battles. Animations in the game are fantastic and the units have nice attention to detail for the most part. It truly is a fun and great game. However, what isn't fun and great is the cost and lack of updates.CA should invest more in a custodian team to fix bugs that have been present for months.These bugs can ruin campaigns such as how Nakai couldn't recruit his signature units.Hard to say what is truly going on at CA but it is suspected that the higher ups aren't giving the devs enough support. It is hard to recommend anyone get the game because of the predatory pricing (especially recently) and amount of DLC. You'll end up spending like 300 to 400 dollars on this game.If you have deep pockets, don't care about bugs, and can stand tone-deaf responses from CA's suits then get the game.",total warhamm impress game offer hundr hour entertain scope game simpli stagger warhamm fantasi world avail sandbox campaign paint map divers select faction play uniqu campaign well battl anim game fantast unit nice attent detail part truli fun great game howev isnt fun great cost lack updatesca invest custodian team fix bug present monthsthes bug ruin campaign nakai couldnt recruit signatur unitshard say truli go ca suspect higher up arent give dev enough support hard recommend anyon get game predatori price especi recent amount dlc youll end spend like dollar gameif deep pocket dont care bug stand tonedeaf respons ca suit get game
"2022 Short version is it's just Dark Souls 4 with jumping and a horse. Long version is that it's one of the most in depth games I've ever played.The world itself is so detailed that you can easily miss little secrets and dungeons. The environment is beautiful and numerous times I've had to check what time it was while playing. I have just gotten lost in the world exploring. If you are a souls vet, you should already be playing this. If you are on the fence, give it a try as it is easily one of the contenders for game of the year already, and its only March. For the PC issues, yes there are stutters, but they aren't that bad and as long as you have your drivers updated you should be fine.Also for the record, I don't believe anyone saying they are beating the game in 60 to 80 hours unless they are following a guide or skipping all of the content that makes this game special. For reference, I have just completed everything in Limgrave , and have only beaten the first major boss. I have explored a little bit of Caelid (red area to the east) and have just went south to The Weeping Peninsula .

"2022 My thoughts about the game on 13th of July 2022. Overall 8/10.I think with the coming of 1.3 my initial review of this game needs work.If initially I was quite annoyed with WH3 coming fresh out of WH2, things have changed.At the moment I can safely say that most of my gripes with the game have been solved. - most of the mechanical issues I faced are sorted. - the RoR units are adding some of the required spice in the game. - The intercept enemy mechanic added in 1.3 is turning the current campaign from a chore to agreeable and fun. - the balance and unit fix aspects helped a ton. Examples: Gorgers went from God mode to decent and Ironguts can actually hit tiny units.There is still one aspect that needs a bit more fixing and that's the Chaos Prince. The direction is ok but he is quite underwhelming from what I have played. I am not going to start quoting Legend but the man speaks the truth.All and all I can see myself recommending this game to my friends as of 1.3.I will also leave my initial review below because removing it would be unfair in my opinion.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My thoughts so far (8th of May 2022):1. Campaign:a) Khorne - 7/10b) Tzeentch 6/10 and that is without taking the last battle into account.c) Nurgle 1/10. 1 point for nurgling terminator squads. The rest of the roster is complete garbage.d) Slaanesh 0/10 just horrible. Start to end.e) Asians 8/10. Both are fun to play.f) Kislev 3/10. When you play them they are chaff, when you fight against them you get karate chopped by normal Kossars. g) Ogres 2/10. Pathing / siege related game breaking issues.h) Demons of chaos. 4/10 Its a bit like the Ukraine situation right now. Your enemy harrases you non stop. Your ""allies"" are committing 9 armies to deal with a rebellion on the other side of the map. This faction has the potential to be the most fun yet weak one. And dont touch Nurgle units / factions or Tzeentch will make you slap your family members then go to war with them.Now for some general thoughts:AI - dumb bully / zerg tactics. They keep recruiting untill they overwhelm you, armies and heroes both. 1/10.Map - 8/10. Preety good but tiny. Rifts make it feel even smaller.Faction Mechanics: 6/10. Some are amazing and some (nurgle) are by default useless (atrition, plagues? plagues as buffs? 1/100 casualties per turn?.The empire factions: - someone screwed up big time here. Last i checked they were not some village idiots clubbing each other to death until the ogres kill them (100% of the time). And 200 turns into the game 4 alied empire factions cannot conquer one vampire castle. 0/10. Empire fans will just delete the game and move on.Overall? 6/10 i guess. I didnt factor all my thoughts up there.Do I recomend it now? No. It is a pale shadow compared to what wh2. Indeed wh2 is fully developed but...If I take my girlfriend to good restaurants most of the time and to McDonald's on her birthday she wont like it.

"2023 This review has been amended post patch 4.2 This game/series continues to be very special. Ambitious dive into a storied and varied setting. Which I had 0 interest about, before picking up this game.Plan to combine content from 3 fully developed and expanded through-out years AAA games.All done with visible, tangible love from people making the game. You can pick any trailer, and it feels like made by a fan of the wargame, bringing miniatures and battlefields into life inside the computer. As it stands, just Total War: Warhammer 3 alone offers ample content, varied and enjoyable, and each piece of content tied to it, be it previous main games or any of the DLCs or FLCs, simply makes it that much grander. Consider that all of the features, units and characters from all the releases tied to this game are always available to the AI, meaning that even if You don't own anything beyond this base game, it's all still present in Your campaigns, likely hostile and used against You, but still. For a project this size, with features that many, there's a lot of rough spots, discrepancies, bugs and pieces of content not up to shape to the newest and coolest. However, given time, the developers will change that. There've been episodes in this game's history that made me think they wouldn't, but as it is right now, things are changing for the better. Sure, some significant bugs are still kicking around past Total War: Warhammer 3's 2nd release anniversary, but now it is more bewildering than it is discouraging. For anyone actually wondering if this game's worth it, if it's to Your fancy, I can't recommend following trailer enough. It kept my hopes up through the bleakest times and most uncertain of times: YouTube™ Video: Total War: WARHAMMER III - Immortal Empires Launch Trailer Views: 2,245,943 Immortal Empires is Now Available to all Total War: WARHAMMER III Players! Immortal Empires is the culmination of the entire Total War: WARHAMMER series. * * * * * * Old review, outdated, written prior to patch 4.2, at the announcement of Shadows of Change DLC This game/series is very special. Ambitious dive into a storied and varied setting. Which I had 0 interest about, before picking up this game.Plan to combine content from 3 fully developed and expanded through-out years AAA games.All done with visible, tangible love from people making the game. You can pick any trailer, and it feels like made by a fan of the wargame, bringing miniatures and battlefields into life inside the computer. However, All through-out Total War: Warhammer 1, 2 and 3, there are issues which slowly diminish, undermine, and ultimately, degrade the experience. And I am not talking purely about bugs, as technical issues come hand in hand with video game development. It's the issues of : attitude, responsibility and viscious cycles.As it stands, Total War: Warhammer 3 is in a state, that absolutely requires patching, polishing and attention. However, because of studio's attitude towards patching, no actual fixes or reworks happen outside of DLC release times for the most part. It feels as if publisher feels no responsiblity regarding delivering a finished, working product, to a point where game's had bugs making paid-for content inaccessible or unplayable for many months, which community's mods were able to fix within days of bugs appearing. This causes viscious cycles, where community is hoping for changes, fixes and revisiting of various outdated parts of the game, only to be left hanging until next DLC, which might introduce patch with some things beings fixed, but inadvertently many others being broken. And despite this, I believe most players would agree, this game has been an amazing experience and journey. Despite some issues being neglected for years, despite cycles staying true and viscious, there's always been hope, sometimes even delivered upon, of this game becoming closer and closer to a perfection, a most complete and broad fantasy strategy of a humongous scale.Latest announcement of DLC ""Shadows of Change"" killed some of that hope. Not because of the content, that I am excited for, but because of everything else regarding it: price got massively increased compared to previous DLC of this type; lots of content people were asking and hoping for, important for general gameplay and not just new factions, is missing; reworks and bug fixes announced so far feel lackluster; even release date is pushed back as far as they could with keeping to their previous announcements. This is happening on top of the facts, that Total War: Warhammer 3 released in a sorry state, that it took close to a year to get things in a somewhat decent shape, that many bugs / spelling mistakes / systems could be fixed, judging by the modders work, within weeks, and that studio did axe another one of their games in the middle of that game's DLC cycle, making community fearful of it happening again.This game's updates and DLCs for the longest time felt like the right kind to me, like the old expansion packs and passionate devs, before industry got swarmed with pointless DLCs, chopped up content, pre-order FOMO crap, and horse armours. Shadows of Change situation feels like it might be over. Trailer is still amazing, game is still a gem, but I can't recommend a title, which seemingly might not receive care and attention necessary to properly polish, finish and round up its development. This is my current sentiment, stemming from experience with the series and attitudes from the community in general. I'd love to be wrong and I'll change my review when I am proven wrong by the studio, but as it is now, things need to change first.",review amend post patch gameseri continu special ambiti dive stori vari set interest pick gameplan combin content fulli develop expand throughout year aaa gamesal done visibl tangibl love peopl make game pick trailer feel like made fan wargam bring miniatur battlefield life insid comput stand total war warhamm alon offer ampl content vari enjoy piec content tie previou main game dlc flc simpli make much grander consid featur unit charact releas tie game alway avail ai mean even dont anyth beyond base game still present campaign like hostil use still project size featur mani there lot rough spot discrep bug piec content shape newest coolest howev given time develop chang therev episod game histori made think wouldnt right thing chang better sure signific bug still kick around past total war warhamm releas anniversari bewild discourag anyon actual wonder game worth fanci cant recommend follow trailer enough kept hope bleakest time uncertain time youtub video total war warhamm iii immort empir launch trailer view immort empir avail total war warhamm iii player immort empir culmin entir total war warhamm seri old review outdat written prior patch announc shadow chang dlc gameseri special ambiti dive stori vari set interest pick gameplan combin content fulli develop expand throughout year aaa gamesal done visibl tangibl love peopl make game pick trailer feel like made fan wargam bring miniatur battlefield life insid comput howev throughout total war warhamm issu slowli diminish undermin ultim degrad experi talk pure bug technic issu come hand hand video game develop issu attitud respons visciou cyclesa stand total war warhamm state absolut requir patch polish attent howev studio attitud toward patch actual fix rework happen outsid dlc releas time part feel publish feel responsibl regard deliv finish work product point game bug make paidfor content inaccess unplay mani month commun mod abl fix within day bug appear caus visciou cycl commun hope chang fix revisit variou outdat part game left hang next dlc might introduc patch thing be fix inadvert mani other broken despit believ player would agre game amaz experi journey despit issu neglect year despit cycl stay true visciou there alway hope sometim even deliv upon game becom closer closer perfect complet broad fantasi strategi humong scalelatest announc dlc shadow chang kill hope content excit everyth els regard price got massiv increas compar previou dlc type lot content peopl ask hope import gener gameplay new faction miss rework bug fix announc far feel lacklust even releas date push back far could keep previou announc happen top fact total war warhamm releas sorri state took close year get thing somewhat decent shape mani bug spell mistak system could fix judg modder work within week studio axe anoth one game middl game dlc cycl make commun fear happen againthi game updat dlc longest time felt like right kind like old expans pack passion dev industri got swarm pointless dlc chop content preorder fomo crap hors armour shadow chang situat feel like might trailer still amaz game still gem cant recommend titl seemingli might receiv care attent necessari properli polish finish round develop current sentiment stem experi seri attitud commun gener id love wrong ill chang review proven wrong studio thing need chang first

However, while I have issues like stuttering too, they are not game-breaking for me and to be honest it is so easy to look pass these minor flaws.The combat, the story, and environment, the level design, the music, all perfect. Just like what we would expect from From Software.They do seem to like to put big boss monsters in tight limited dungeon space though. And it seems they like copy and pasting bosses here and there too (You will see similar boss which are just usually bigger version of their dungeon counterpart).While I personally still enjoy Sekiro's combat system more, the combat system in Elden Ring is 34572093x better than that of Dark Souls 3, and that alone would make me want to keep playing this game.TL;DR: Minor performance issue, almost perfect everything else.",understand peopl satisfi stutter frame drop howev issu like stutter gamebreak honest easi look pass minor flawsth combat stori environ level design music perfect like would expect softwarethey seem like put big boss monster tight limit dungeon space though seem like copi past boss see similar boss usual bigger version dungeon counterpartwhil person still enjoy sekiro combat system combat system elden ring better dark soul alon would make want keep play gametldr minor perform issu almost perfect everyth els

2022 it's ok i guess,ok guess
"""Comparison is the thief of joy"" Yes... if there weren't other games like this I would've probably given a better rating, but due to the nature of the game and not being the only one of the genre (much less the best), it's impossible not to take reference points, and being that the case as much as it pains me, I just can't recommend it as is.- Poor performance and dissapointing graphics I have to start by saying that it seems the game is not greatly optimized and in some PCs (even High End) the graphics seem oversharpened and just not good in general. I have a high-end PC and suffer both problems, the performance is not great and even on the highest settings the game just looks awful, the best way to describe it being that it just looks way too sharpened, almost pixel looking up close, and that's again, with an expensive PC, I don't want to imagine how this runs on lower systems. Combat never clicked; was ambitious yet mastered nothing This is the one that pains me the most, as that was the selling point for me. The combat initially seemed extremely fun, having so much variety and interesting mechanics/new ideas, however, despite all it's ambition to try different things, it just never came together for me. It lacked that spark of satisfaction that other games like Sekiro or Lies of P did, and as much as I didn't want to compare, it's immediately noticeable that it did take inspirations from lots of games, and doing so one would think: ""Great!, it's going to be the best since it took everything that made those games shine and bring it all on a single game!"" well... it was good but not great, by taking so much from other games and mixing it all it seems like they forgot what made those games great, and it was that every single one of those games excelled and mastered something, and by doing so much, they forgot to master anything.The end result being an okay combat that for some reason just leaves you thinking something's gotta be missing and that even when it seems new, it feels a lot like other games you've played before. Average boss design and tedious difficulty The boss design was what you could've expected from literally any other company, meaning: generic. Some were interesting but nothing that made me say ""wow"". As for the difficulty, some bosses felt really easy while others felt like a complete chore, I adore difficult games, be it Sekiro, Dark Souls, Sifu, etc. you name it, I've played it, and generally found them enjoyable in their own way, not with this game unfortunately. When I found a boss that felt difficult I was like: ""Finally!"", but for some reason it always ended the same way, with me sighing and just wanting to be over with it as soon as possible, something that almost never happened with other games, but for some reason some bosses felt straight up tedious even when none of them took me a quarter of the time some of the most difficult bosses from other games took me.Some of the factors that made me think this way were: Odd hitboxes, big health pools, odd hitboxes, repetitive moves and oh did I forget? Odd hitboxes... Out of the dozens of bosses I've fought, only one of them stood out: Tiger Vanguard. Progression and rewards that felt meaningless One would've thought that after going through so much grinding the rewards would be amazing, well, think twice my guy cause not here. A lot of the rewards given were just straight up useless and the Spark points given to improve abilities felt more often than not that they changed nothing at all. Not a single time do you feel ""powerful"" on the game and neither do you get in like a ""Zen"" mode where you just feel like the game clicked and you can fight your way through without trouble (if you've finished Sekiro you know perfectly what I mean by Zen Mode), because bosses are always changing and finding a way to screw you different than before. Conclusion Even when trying to play it as it's own thing and not compare it to other games, it felt like an ambitious game that promised much but excelled at nothing, making it impossible not to look back at the games it took inspiration from.Poor performance, half cooked combat, mediocre boss design, tedious difficulty and a not story telling that I didn't care for.Oddly enough, it's not completely unenjoyable, just seemed like it tried to do more than it could, I guess it depends on the kind of games you like to play, but if we compare it to others of similar genres it's really easy to see where this lacks. I would wait for a discount.6.5/10.",comparison thief joy ye werent game like wouldv probabl given better rate due natur game one genr much less best imposs take refer point case much pain cant recommend poor perform dissapoint graphic start say seem game greatli optim pc even high end graphic seem oversharpen good gener highend pc suffer problem perform great even highest set game look aw best way describ look way sharpen almost pixel look close that expens pc dont want imagin run lower system combat never click ambiti yet master noth one pain sell point combat initi seem extrem fun much varieti interest mechanicsnew idea howev despit ambit tri differ thing never came togeth lack spark satisfact game like sekiro lie p much didnt want compar immedi notic take inspir lot game one would think great go best sinc took everyth made game shine bring singl game well good great take much game mix seem like forgot made game great everi singl one game excel master someth much forgot master anythingth end result okay combat reason leav think someth got ta miss even seem new feel lot like game youv play averag boss design tediou difficulti boss design couldv expect liter compani mean gener interest noth made say wow difficulti boss felt realli easi other felt like complet chore ador difficult game sekiro dark soul sifu etc name ive play gener found enjoy way game unfortun found boss felt difficult like final reason alway end way sigh want soon possibl someth almost never happen game reason boss felt straight tediou even none took quarter time difficult boss game took mesom factor made think way odd hitbox big health pool odd hitbox repetit move oh forget odd hitbox dozen boss ive fought one stood tiger vanguard progress reward felt meaningless one wouldv thought go much grind reward would amaz well think twice guy caus lot reward given straight useless spark point given improv abil felt often chang noth singl time feel power game neither get like zen mode feel like game click fight way without troubl youv finish sekiro know perfectli mean zen mode boss alway chang find way screw differ conclus even tri play thing compar game felt like ambiti game promis much excel noth make imposs look back game took inspir frompoor perform half cook combat mediocr boss design tediou difficulti stori tell didnt care foroddli enough complet unenjoy seem like tri could guess depend kind game like play compar other similar genr realli easi see lack would wait

"2023 It's probably the pinnacle of all three Total War Warhammer games, with vast amounts of content, since all three games are linked, you own Norsca in the first game? Yeah you can play them in the third game, and so on. If you're into Warhammer Fantasy and like 4x and RTS games, this is a must buy, it's pretty much a perfect game. I'll go on and list some issues with the game because beside these, it's still a strong recommendation!Issue 1: Huge Map, the world map of Immortal Empires is a continuation of the second game's map, which was already a huge size improvement of the first game, and it's big enough where you can conquer part of the whole map and still feel ""finished"" with said campaign. So if you're like me, and love covering the map and rule supreme, you can easily dive 30h+ into a campaign and still not finish. I've played this for 300h+ and I've only really finished one campaign ""fully"" I've achived short and long victories but full map campaign victory, only once and that was with high elves.Issue 2: the game economy doesn't scale well in end-game. So you will usually hit tier 5 main building at the same time as you start getting close to short victory, and due to the bonuses short and long victory grants you and no penalty for large imperial taxation, growth will snowball and you'll end up with insane economic advantages, where in end of my high eld campaign, I could probably lose 15+ armies in a single turn and that not really being an issue.Issue 3: auto-resolve, AR will still over value certain setups, where they seem to premiere good balanced armies and certain units, when that isn't always the case. Too be clear, this is more of a minor thing and auto resolve is still better than in the second game, which itself was way better than the first game. So take this with a grain of salt.",probabl pinnacl three total war warhamm game vast amount content sinc three game link norsca first game yeah play third game your warhamm fantasi like rt game must buy pretti much perfect game ill go list issu game besid still strong recommendationissu huge map world map immort empir continu second game map alreadi huge size improv first game big enough conquer part whole map still feel finish said campaign your like love cover map rule suprem easili dive campaign still finish ive play ive realli finish one campaign fulli ive achiv short long victori full map campaign victori high elvesissu game economi doesnt scale well endgam usual hit tier main build time start get close short victori due bonus short long victori grant penalti larg imperi taxat growth snowbal youll end insan econom advantag end high eld campaign could probabl lose armi singl turn realli issueissu autoresolv ar still valu certain setup seem premier good balanc armi certain unit isnt alway case clear minor thing auto resolv still better second game way better first game take grain salt

"Black Myth: Wukong is arguably one of the best games I have played this year. The games is gorgeous; its combat is addictive and fluid; presents a decent challenge, especially to those that are new to souls-like games and other games of similar nature. However, the game sometimes feels like its leaving you in the dark.As Black Myth: Wukong is based of the classic Chinese novel A Journey to the West, i expected a bit more of a comprehensive story. There are many story beats that are often left unexplained and leave the player in the dark wanting to know more. While this is not always a bad thing, I personally felt that some of the more important story beats felt underwhelming due to just being unexplained. Despite all of this, it is fairly simple to put the pieces together (quite literally) and understand what your purpose is as The Destined One. Each chapter culminates in an animation that is not only amazing but the key you in on some of the characters ambitions and trials of tribulation. Most certainly a bright spot when it comes to storytelling. But again, the story left me wanting to know more about the characters and who they are. But, I suppose I should just invest on the original novel to know more.As mentioned, the combat in Black Myth: Wukong is incredible, It is engaging and easy to understand. This is in part thanks to the handy array of transformations and spells you can earn throughout the game. It truly is amazing that most of the bosses are unique and manage to find a way to separate themselves from others. While I did not find myself stuck on most of the bosses, they should present themselves as a decent challenge to those new to the journey. I personally wish that some of the more story related bosses where more difficult. The game also has some of the best fight sequences I have ever seen, especially a certain sequence related to the true ending. The biggest part of the combat is to understand what your weapons and skills do and its correlation with the armor you are wearing, especially late game. The better you understand them, the easier your fights will be. Its also important to mention that your character and skills can be leveled up throughout the game. With that being said, its important to acknowledge what skills you need and what skills you don't. This is something you can only really figure out through playing with the variety of different skills though.Overall, I truly enjoyed Black Myth: Wukong and I hope that the rumors that the devs are planning a trilogy are true. I most certainly plan on going back for a NG+ run to collect the handful of achievements I had missed. People coming to play this game in wake of Elden Rings DLC will most certainly find themselves having a good time. New players should also find themselves enjoying the game. My biggest recommendation is for people to take their time and take in the world. There are handful of bosses and quests that are missable if you are not careful enough. The game should take most people, if you are thorough, anywhere between 30-40hrs to complete. It is also important to mention that is game is a bit more like a boss rush than it is a traditional souls-like.Score: 8/10 (Great)",black myth wukong arguabl one best game play year game gorgeou combat addict fluid present decent challeng especi new soulslik game game similar natur howev game sometim feel like leav darka black myth wukong base classic chines novel journey west expect bit comprehens stori mani stori beat often left unexplain leav player dark want know alway bad thing person felt import stori beat felt underwhelm due unexplain despit fairli simpl put piec togeth quit liter understand purpos destin one chapter culmin anim amaz key charact ambit trial tribul certainli bright spot come storytel stori left want know charact suppos invest origin novel know morea mention combat black myth wukong incred engag easi understand part thank handi array transform spell earn throughout game truli amaz boss uniqu manag find way separ other find stuck boss present decent challeng new journey person wish stori relat boss difficult game also best fight sequenc ever seen especi certain sequenc relat true end biggest part combat understand weapon skill correl armor wear especi late game better understand easier fight also import mention charact skill level throughout game said import acknowledg skill need skill dont someth realli figur play varieti differ skill thoughoveral truli enjoy black myth wukong hope rumor dev plan trilog true certainli plan go back ng run collect hand achiev miss peopl come play game wake elden ring dlc certainli find good time new player also find enjoy game biggest recommend peopl take time take world hand boss quest missabl care enough game take peopl thorough anywher complet also import mention game bit like boss rush tradit soulslikescor great

"2022 As much as I love this game and how much history I have with the Total War franchise, I simply cannot recommend this if you are a new player looking to get into the Warhammer series.

"While far from perfect. As a Warhammer 40k fan. I had high expectations for a Space Marine sequel. And Space Marine 2 mostly fulfills those expectations. A few notes on the game.-Campaign is great. Great story, visuals, and game play. A bit short. Room for more, hopefully in a DLC. -Great loyalist appearance customization. -No heretic customization, other than some colors.-Operations is a great idea, to few missions.-PVP is great in concept, to few maps. Balance issues.-No DRM (big win)-Needs better mode management. (Do I have to auto join matchmaking every time I want to access my PVP / Operations appearance?)",far perfect warhamm fan high expect space marin sequel space marin mostli fulfil expect note gamecampaign great great stori visual game play bit short room hope dlc great loyalist appear custom heret custom colorsoper great idea missionspvp great concept map balanc issuesno drm big winne better mode manag auto join matchmak everi time want access pvp oper appear

"As someone who's put nearly 200 hours across the betas and tests. There's a severe abundance of misinformation being spread about the game so let's hit all the main points quickly, shall we?- Within hours of launch, the team fixed the ability to create characters on other servers- The terms of service and privacy policy issue: one guy read it and everyone else is vomiting that information based on that person's findings. These terms are no different from the majority of other modern games you accept today.- The gacha ""Wish Machine"" is used to unlock blueprints of some powerful weapons and it is a gamble. THE ONLY TWO WAYS of receiving this currency is playing the game, and available in the FREE battle pass tiers. There's literally no way to exchange real money for this currency. You have to earn it.- Spyware/cryptominer claims is just bafflingIf you dislike the game because you don't find it fun, having performance issues, or connection problems. Then those are some valid reasons to dislike the game.------------------------A bit of an actual review of the game nowThe game is mindless fun.It's not a masterpiece by any means. The combat is slightly janky, and not very challenging. Base building has some slight jank to it. The enemies aren't very engaging most of the time.But damn the game is funIf you're looking for something you can turn your brain off to and not need to try very hard but you're looking for a sense of solid, consistent progression, you should give this game a try.One thing I will glorify the game for however. Is the ability to craft from storage containers in your base. When you enter any building menu (base build menu, furnace, weapon workbench, etc.) it will automatically pull resources from all storage crates you have in your territory. No more forgetting where you put those copper bars, or metal scrap. It's all accessible to you at any time.The game also does a really good job at drip feeding you enjoyable content. You play a little bit and get tired of running everywhere, hey here's a quest to unlock a motorcycle and fast travel. Getting tired of collecting wood for charcoal? Here's how to setup electricity and eliminate your need for charcoal for furnaces. You've been doing a lot of looting but want to spend a little more time in your base, here's a new system that you have to build defenses and waves of enemies try attacking your base for some nice rewards. Tired of collecting wood and ore and just want to shoot stuff? Here's how to unlock an auto logger and auto miner that will passively gather things for you while you're off exploring.This is one of those things that gives me hope for the future of this game. There's a lot of attention to detail and innovative stuff when it comes to core survival game systems that we've seen unchanged for so many years.The one criticism I've been seeing pop is the seasonal reset stuff. If that's a turn off for you that's totally fine, it's not for everyone. But people thinking it's the end of the world need to relax a little. Rust does this every month, and that game came out 10 years ago. But it still consistently remains in the top 10 most active players on Steam to this day. The devs have said for this game you'll keep your blueprints on reset, which is arguably way more time and effort to farm than chopping some trees and hitting some rocks to make the weapons/armor. On season resets your materials (wood, ores, etc.) will be moved to this thing called ""Eternaland"" which is basically a big private oasis you can invite friends that's separate from the main game. Personal player housing that won't reset.Personally I'm using this two month period as a trial run. How bad will I feel during next reset when stuff gets wiped. Will I still be motivated to play? We'll find out in two months.The combat isn't difficult, there can be some downtime, but damn the game is fun.It's free, just try it and decide for yourself. Stop reading reviews. If you like it, you like it. If you don't, you don't, and that's okay <3",someon who put nearli hour across beta test there sever abund misinform spread game let hit main point quickli shall within hour launch team fix abil creat charact server term servic privaci polici issu one guy read everyon els vomit inform base person find term differ major modern game accept today gacha wish machin use unlock blueprint power weapon gambl two way receiv currenc play game avail free battl pass tier there liter way exchang real money currenc earn spywarecryptomin claim bafflingif dislik game dont find fun perform issu connect problem valid reason dislik gamea bit actual review game nowth game mindless funit masterpiec mean combat slightli janki challeng base build slight jank enemi arent engag timebut damn game funif your look someth turn brain need tri hard your look sens solid consist progress give game tryon thing glorifi game howev abil craft storag contain base enter build menu base build menu furnac weapon workbench etc automat pull resourc storag crate territori forget put copper bar metal scrap access timeth game also realli good job drip feed enjoy content play littl bit get tire run everywher hey here quest unlock motorcycl fast travel get tire collect wood charcoal here setup electr elimin need charcoal furnac youv lot loot want spend littl time base here new system build defens wave enemi tri attack base nice reward tire collect wood ore want shoot stuff here unlock auto logger auto miner passiv gather thing your exploringthi one thing give hope futur game there lot attent detail innov stuff come core surviv game system weve seen unchang mani yearsth one critic ive see pop season reset stuff that turn that total fine everyon peopl think end world need relax littl rust everi month game came year ago still consist remain top activ player steam day dev said game youll keep blueprint reset arguabl way time effort farm chop tree hit rock make weaponsarmor season reset materi wood ore etc move thing call eternaland basic big privat oasi invit friend that separ main game person player hous wont resetperson im use two month period trial run bad feel next reset stuff get wipe still motiv play well find two monthsth combat isnt difficult downtim damn game funit free tri decid stop read review like like dont dont that okay

"After much anticipation, I finally had the chance to delve into Black Myth: Wukong. Here’s my take on this visually stunning yet somewhat uneven experience.Visuals and Art DirectionFrom the moment you step into the world of Black Myth: Wukong, it's hard not to be impressed. The game’s visual design is nothing short of extraordinary. Character models, environments, and special effects are meticulously crafted, reflecting a deep respect for Chinese mythology. The art direction captures both the otherworldly and culturally authentic aspects of its source material. Whether it's the detailed textures or the grandeur of the set pieces, the game feels like a living, breathing work of art. It’s clear that the developers poured their heart into these details.Combat: Exciting but RepetitiveThe combat in Black Myth: Wukong starts off exhilarating, combining elements from modern action games like Sekiro and Nioh. The fast-paced action and variety of abilities and transformations provide a thrilling experience. However, as you progress, the excitement begins to wane. The combat system becomes somewhat repetitive, with the same light attack combo being used extensively. Despite the initial variety, the stances and combos lack the depth needed to keep the action fresh over long stretches. Boss fights, though, are a highlight. Each encounter feels unique, and the sheer number of bosses is impressive, making these battles some of the game’s most engaging moments.Level Design: Visually Stunning but Lacking SubstanceWhile the game’s environments are visually striking, the level design often falls short. Chapters 2 and 3, in particular, feel like barren wastelands, with desert and snow areas that lack depth and density. The repetitive nature of the combat only exacerbates this issue, turning exploration into a sometimes tedious task. It’s a shame because the visuals promise so much, but the actual level layouts don’t always deliver.Story and AtmosphereThe story in Black Myth: Wukong is rooted in rich folklore but struggles to stand on its own. It relies heavily on the mythological background without crafting a compelling narrative of its own. The writing is vague, which might leave players who aren’t familiar with the source material feeling disconnected. However, the game’s atmosphere remains captivating, driven by its strong world-building and mythical elements. The setting and ambiance create an immersive experience, even if the story itself doesn’t quite hit the mark.Overall ImpressionsBlack Myth: Wukong is a game with clear highs and some noticeable lows. The visuals are spectacular, the boss design is top-notch, and the atmosphere is enchanting. Yet, the repetitive combat, lackluster level design, and a story that doesn’t quite engage detract from its overall impact. It’s a good game, but it doesn’t fully realize its potential. I’d rate it a 7 out of 10 – a solid and enjoyable experience with room for improvement.If you’re drawn to visually stunning games with engaging boss fights and a rich setting, Black Myth: Wukong is worth checking out. Just be prepared for some repetition along the way. >>>>Curator Page<<<<",much anticip final chanc delv black myth wukong here take visual stun yet somewhat uneven experiencevisu art directionfrom moment step world black myth wukong hard impress game visual design noth short extraordinari charact model environ special effect meticul craft reflect deep respect chines mytholog art direct captur otherworldli cultur authent aspect sourc materi whether detail textur grandeur set piec game feel like live breath work art clear develop pour heart detailscombat excit repetitiveth combat black myth wukong start exhilar combin element modern action game like sekiro nioh fastpac action varieti abil transform provid thrill experi howev progress excit begin wane combat system becom somewhat repetit light attack combo use extens despit initi varieti stanc combo lack depth need keep action fresh long stretch boss fight though highlight encount feel uniqu sheer number boss impress make battl game engag momentslevel design visual stun lack substancewhil game environ visual strike level design often fall short chapter particular feel like barren wasteland desert snow area lack depth densiti repetit natur combat exacerb issu turn explor sometim tediou task shame visual promis much actual level layout dont alway deliverstori atmosphereth stori black myth wukong root rich folklor struggl stand reli heavili mytholog background without craft compel narr write vagu might leav player arent familiar sourc materi feel disconnect howev game atmospher remain captiv driven strong worldbuild mythic element set ambianc creat immers experi even stori doesnt quit hit markoveral impressionsblack myth wukong game clear high notic low visual spectacular boss design topnotch atmospher enchant yet repetit combat lacklust level design stori doesnt quit engag detract overal impact good game doesnt fulli realiz potenti id rate solid enjoy experi room improvementif your drawn visual stun game engag boss fight rich set black myth wukong worth check prepar repetit along way curat page

"2022 Review of Realms of Chaos is 6/10 after their patches because it still is not enjoyable to expand empire.Immortal Empires 7.5/10 due to really obvious anti player bias for the AI, Patch 3.0 has fixed fixed some of the issues I will discuss but they are still there to a lesser degree. AI is programmed not to expand it's empire, it avoids nearby enemies and comes straight for you. It avoids direct field combat with you and goes around sacking your settlements. WHII campaign AI seemed to be more logical and aggressive in trying to expand not going around sacking settlements.If CA is worried about keeping Legendary Lords alive make confederations easier for player and AI that way lords will remain alive for the player to encounter later but part of another faction. This will also grow the the factions leading to more meaningful wars between large factions.",review realm chao patch still enjoy expand empireimmort empir due realli obviou anti player bia ai patch fix fix issu discuss still lesser degre ai program expand empir avoid nearbi enemi come straight avoid direct field combat goe around sack settlement whii campaign ai seem logic aggress tri expand go around sack settlementsif ca worri keep legendari lord aliv make confeder easier player ai way lord remain aliv player encount later part anoth faction also grow faction lead meaning war larg faction

"What a pleasant surprise of a game.Probably best described as a better version of the recent GOW games with some small semblance to Souls games.Top tier quality production with no major bugs at least for my play through. It looks amazing on the highest settings with full Ray tracing, tho very demanding, however the performance is pretty good and scales well at lower settings.Most of the game is a power fantasy where you are way stronger than the bosses and it feels great, however it does have one optional boss that is a real contender for being one of the best bosses in gaming, that fight does make you work a bit to win.Story is definitely going to go over most people's heads, you do have to think about it and try to understand what characters are really doing and why. Not for those that want to be feed all the story without any effort to understand it.Only meaningful downside is the huge amount of invisible walls in places that seem like you should be able to go to.Were it not for Shadow of the Erdtree even being ""Just a DLC"", this would be my pick for GOTY.",pleasant surpris gameprob best describ better version recent gow game small semblanc soul gamestop tier qualiti product major bug least play look amaz highest set full ray trace tho demand howev perform pretti good scale well lower settingsmost game power fantasi way stronger boss feel great howev one option boss real contend one best boss game fight make work bit winstori definit go go peopl head think tri understand charact realli want feed stori without effort understand itonli meaning downsid huge amount invis wall place seem like abl go tower shadow erdtre even dlc would pick goti

"2023 I switched my review to positive in light of the latest improvements, but I still need to talk about those things. It's obvious that CA/Sega have leadership and management issues, which is baffling because they've delivered solid products in the past. The TW:WH game series is my favorite strategy game of all time. I don’t think any game can top it, and I’ll definitely put hundreds more hours into it. Why would CA management push such terribly bad ideas when the recipe for success is clear? You have very competent people on your team, listen to them, listen to the Total War Community, deliver great products, and everyone will be happy.One clear example of bad decisions was the new capture-the-flag siege system introduced in WH3. It made no sense, but they couldn't admit their mistake. They eventually dialed it back, and now it’s more like the regular siege from WH2. Another example is the Realms of Chaos campaign, which was mostly unplayable and eventually abandoned. I never finished it because, after the WH2 campaign, it was just bad.Why is this important? The game is huge, with around 100 playable factions from 24 races. Not only are the races different, but the factions themselves often provide unique gameplay mechanics and unit rosters. You can play for hundreds of hours and still only experience a fraction of the game. Getting the base game and some DLCs is already a hefty investment (wait for the sale, and the best cost/value DLCs are the base WH1 and WH2 games on sale). No one wants to commit time and money to a game and then see it fail.So, the game is amazing and in good shape now, thanks to the Total War Community. Get it, play it, and let’s hope CA gets their stuff together.My original review: It's a great game and I love it. Unfortunately, it seems that the CA's management made a series of bad decisions and they think it's ok to make their customers pay for those mistakes. Also they think it's ok to ban people for speaking up and criticising them.

And get completely deleted by artillery. They also still haven't really fixed siege battles. Walls tend to be kinda barren and it just feels wrong still for a setting that is known for some extremely well defended cities. It would be good if there were fallback positions or something that were consistently viable across the various walled maps. Ai also cheats or is given mechanical cheats - like how you often aren't allowed a retreat zone from ambushes (the retreat zone exists outside the map and is inaccessible). So fun and engaging when skaven get to paint themselves purple as you watch and then cut your limbs off with no reinforcements. SO ENGAGING. GREAT DESIGN. Offensive ambushes in general are bad mechanics that have zero counterplay aside from having a good enough individual army to just win every battle (after you watch the completely meaningless unskippable 15 second cutscene of your leader walking which is so interesting when you have to deal with another stupid rat ambush). Performance is honestly terrible. Maxing out a 3070ti on high at 1440p not quite 60fps ON THE CAMPAIGN MAP? The same campaign map where zone edge borders are aliased when there's corruption like it's 2005?I don't have ridiculous standards but I do expect some quality of life from the third game. I should not be ragequitting from bs every session after getting sick of clawing for every shred of satisfaction. Not to mention the questionable notion of campaign difficulty impacting auto resolve instead of the battle difficulty setting? Surely if auto resolve is meant to represent your battles, the difficulty thereof should be what controls it rather than wanting diplomacy, map blobbing, and economy to be more challenging?Bug are a thing, i have a campaign where the quest battle didn't spawn and can't be teleported to. AI also appears to play by different movement rules, so they kinda just teleport behind you for a fun and engaging game of whack-a-mole with march stance. they also like to do nonsense double jeopardy battles where they'll assault, and lose, then immediately re-attack, and this is mechanically BS because defender units get completely wiped out when they break, but attacker units do not (it makes some sense because half the time defender units run out into enemy territory, but that's also nonsense because there's a keep to retreat to). And because the chain of nonsense isn't quite over yet, this game causes frequent bluescreens - about 1 every ten hours of playtime. It's only this game and it happens exactly when I click an in-game button. And there's this weird thing where CA required the first two games for a good chunk of the immortal empires content but also still absolutely 100% insists they're worth the full AAA $60 pricetag. For reasons.Re-review:All of the same hold but mods do improve it. But mods can only do so much and cant do anything at all about how your units have a mind of their own and/or ears full of cotton. Might as well build a monstrous infantry doomstack because every unit behaves like them.It also disables all your mods every time the game updates so you better write down which ones you had on.And for some reason fullscreen is just two or three pixels short. I was hoping it'd go away but no amount of debugging and troubleshooting actually made the game not have strange bugged pixels in the lower left and a few columns along the right. No other game including the previous two games does this, so it's just completely baffling.",fun im game tend despit game rather game need tune unit respons battl path sick unit decid contest ladder look much faster wide open unblock gate absolut order unit run around circl purpos skip entir shift click rout decid actual go count complet get complet delet artilleri also still havent realli fix sieg battl wall tend kinda barren feel wrong still set known extrem well defend citi would good fallback posit someth consist viabl across variou wall map ai also cheat given mechan cheat like often arent allow retreat zone ambush retreat zone exist outsid map inaccess fun engag skaven get paint purpl watch cut limb reinforc engag great design offens ambush gener bad mechan zero counterplay asid good enough individu armi win everi battl watch complet meaningless unskipp second cutscen leader walk interest deal anoth stupid rat ambush perform honestli terribl max high quit campaign map campaign map zone edg border alias there corrupt like dont ridicul standard expect qualiti life third game ragequit bs everi session get sick claw everi shred satisfact mention question notion campaign difficulti impact auto resolv instead battl difficulti set sure auto resolv meant repres battl difficulti thereof control rather want diplomaci map blob economi challengingbug thing campaign quest battl didnt spawn cant teleport ai also appear play differ movement rule kinda teleport behind fun engag game whackamol march stanc also like nonsens doubl jeopardi battl theyll assault lose immedi reattack mechan bs defend unit get complet wipe break attack unit make sens half time defend unit run enemi territori that also nonsens there keep retreat chain nonsens isnt quit yet game caus frequent bluescreen everi ten hour playtim game happen exactli click ingam button there weird thing ca requir first two game good chunk immort empir content also still absolut insist theyr worth full aaa pricetag reasonsrereviewal hold mod improv mod much cant anyth unit mind andor ear full cotton might well build monstrou infantri doomstack everi unit behav like themit also disabl mod everi time game updat better write one onand reason fullscreen two three pixel short hope itd go away amount debug troubleshoot actual made game strang bug pixel lower left column along right game includ previou two game complet baffl

"Sleeping with a big floofy Cat literally improves your sanity 10/10For real though; the game has issues, definitely needs some work, but is still a lot of fun in its current state.Base building is pretty basic, and is probably the most jank part of this game, so I hope to see more variety and improvements in the future.The story isn't all that interesting. But to be fair, it seems like gameplay was the primary focus here. Which is fine.Enemy design, particularly the more unique ones, are very creative and amazing for a first encounter.For gameplay, it feels like a mix of Rust and The Division. Thankfully, PvP isn't required. I enjoy a more casual PvE experience, with small instances of PvP thrown in there via Events, which are occasionally available.Seasonal wipes have been a concern for many, definitely not for everyone, but I think it keeps things fresh while allowing you to keep some things like currencies, skins, blueprints, etc, which are the main time sinks. Leveling, gearing, and building are fairly quick and easy, especially with some experience, so so I wouldn't consider it a negative. If anything, it makes the game more approachable to new players at the start of every season.As of writing, the only monetization within the game is purely cosmetic. Let's hope it stays that way.For a free to play game, I'm quite happy with it. Looking forward to future updates.Get some friends together, give it a try, you're losing nothing but time.",sleep big floofi cat liter improv saniti real though game issu definit need work still lot fun current statebas build pretti basic probabl jank part game hope see varieti improv futureth stori isnt interest fair seem like gameplay primari focu fineenemi design particularli uniqu one creativ amaz first encounterfor gameplay feel like mix rust divis thank pvp isnt requir enjoy casual pve experi small instanc pvp thrown via event occasion availableseason wipe concern mani definit everyon think keep thing fresh allow keep thing like currenc skin blueprint etc main time sink level gear build fairli quick easi especi experi wouldnt consid neg anyth make game approach new player start everi seasona write monet within game pure cosmet let hope stay wayfor free play game im quit happi look forward futur updatesget friend togeth give tri your lose noth time
"It's fun but not worth £50. It is very samey and the combat gets somewhat mundane. I hope they go down the combined arms route more (so using tanks/aircraft etc). Alternatively, fleshing the story out further than a meagre 6 hours would also be a good way to retain player interest.

"If my private information (which I didn't need to provide, so no harm done) is the price I pay for a decently made MMO game in 2024, so be it. Seems like it is very well thought, not to heavy on the grind for materials, combat is nice with moves depending on what weapon you use not just ""left click to attack"". Base building seems fun, reminds me of the fun parts of Fallout 76. Again, when I play more of this, I will update my suggestion. Also, DON'T wait in queues, there are servers recommended that have zero queue.

"2018 Valve Anti Cheat Okay Valve. I spent $20 dollars on this game only for it to go free just a year later? I want my money back.I was really annoyed at the time this review was written, so pardon my redundant vocabulary throughout this review.Valve taking advantage of their customersComparable to other greedy f**knuggets in the gaming industry, today, Valve has set the bar up there with EA and Bethesda.You know what Valve, instead of using all that money and resources you got sitting over there to give us, your customers, our long awaited sequels we've respectfully requested since 2004. Example: Half Life 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3 etc. You @$$holes think your next best move is to create a battle royale mode for a $20 dollar game you released 6 years ago, that has randomized loot box Activision/EA microtransactions? Hey here's an idea, Valve: How about you lazy f**ks start tending to the rampant issue of hackers in this effing game. By making this game free, you open a large window for hackers and other cheaters; they've invaded Counter-Strike faster than the Germans invaded Poland. Cheaters are just showing up in Prime Matchmaking; what the hell's the point of even paying $15 dollars for the Prime Status Upgrade? What the hell is this, Valve? As a matter of fact, I stopped playing this game last year because of this problem. Why make Counter-Strike: Global Offensive free? Ah, so you can attempt to hook and entice people to purchase your stupid $2.50 one time use keys for your BS randomized loot boxes to maximize profit.Valve's GreedYour intentions, your methods have not changed at all. The one time you want to create content other than cosmetic skins to sell separately, you decide to jump on the popular battle royal train to maximize profit. I mean, really? A battle royale mode for Counter-Strike? Doesn't that seem a little strange and unnecessary for a game like this? What, are we gonna see a battle royale mode in Rainbow Six next month? Like I stated earlier, there are infinitely better and creative things you can make with all those resources. As if you haven't got enough money from hosting tournaments, video game sales and loot box sales, you need more money? What are you trying to prove with this?The fact that you even thought this was a good idea proves your intentions, this showcases your true nature batter than anything else. You don't give a damn about the customers, the players, the fans, you don't give a f**k. You care about money, and that's it. There's more important things in life, Valve. You can make money without being a piece of sh%t.EpilogueI can't support Valve anymore. I can't do it. This is the end of my respect for this company, who once represented the best for PC gamers. People are gonna look back at this and approach Valve with caution. I am done with you, Valve. After Dying Light 2 is released, I'll be looking for another source to purchase my video games from.This really does suck. The gaming industry has done a great job at gradually pushing me away from it with their sickening lack of respect for their audience, as I have watched over the last decade how game series I used to adore have been ripped apart for the sake of loot box supply drop microtransaction systems, and Counter-Strike is no different. So all of that is literally every major aspect of the game and I enjoy none of it for the reasons I just stated.Oh yeah and all of you writing positive reviews for this game today are effing morons.Here's a clip to summarize my experience in Counter-Strike: Global OffensiveBut tell me what you think. Am I overreacting? Or is what I say pretty spot on?Tell me your thoughts and opinions in the comments below.",valv anti cheat okay valv spent dollar game go free year later want money backi realli annoy time review written pardon redund vocabulari throughout reviewvalv take advantag customerscompar greedi fknugget game industri today valv set bar ea bethesday know valv instead use money resourc got sit give us custom long await sequel weve respect request sinc exampl half life left dead portal etc hole think next best move creat battl royal mode dollar game releas year ago random loot box activisionea microtransact hey here idea valv lazi fk start tend rampant issu hacker ef game make game free open larg window hacker cheater theyv invad counterstrik faster german invad poland cheater show prime matchmak hell point even pay dollar prime statu upgrad hell valv matter fact stop play game last year problem make counterstrik global offens free ah attempt hook entic peopl purchas stupid one time use key bs random loot box maxim profitvalv greedyour intent method chang one time want creat content cosmet skin sell separ decid jump popular battl royal train maxim profit mean realli battl royal mode counterstrik doesnt seem littl strang unnecessari game like gon na see battl royal mode rainbow six next month like state earlier infinit better creativ thing make resourc havent got enough money host tournament video game sale loot box sale need money tri prove thisth fact even thought good idea prove intent showcas true natur batter anyth els dont give damn custom player fan dont give fk care money that there import thing life valv make money without piec shtepiloguei cant support valv anymor cant end respect compani repres best pc gamer peopl gon na look back approach valv caution done valv die light releas ill look anoth sourc purchas video game fromthi realli suck game industri done great job gradual push away sicken lack respect audienc watch last decad game seri use ador rip apart sake loot box suppli drop microtransact system counterstrik differ liter everi major aspect game enjoy none reason statedoh yeah write posit review game today ef moronsher clip summar experi counterstrik global offensivebut tell think overreact say pretti spot ontel thought opinion comment

"2022 Ok not sure what's going on, it could be the whole donuvo thing that everyone is talking about, but this game is slooooow. The load time for even the smallest battles takes ages. Even the first battle at the beginning of a campaign takes at least 5 mins to load, and those are not big fights. I started auto resolving everything which means I lost slot of fights I should have won. Other than that I like it, I'll give it a thumbs up once it's fixed",ok sure what go could whole donuvo thing everyon talk game slooooow load time even smallest battl take age even first battl begin campaign take least min load big fight start auto resolv everyth mean lost slot fight like ill give thumb fix
"For quite a few people the game doesn't make it past the first cinematic. I've tried the stuff people have said online and from what I can tell it hasn't been addressed by the developers yet. This is very disappointing for those who were looking forwards to this game. I will update this review if it ever gets fixed. For now, I don't recommend this game due to the fact that it may be unplayable for some players.Edit: While the intro cinematic crash has been fixed, the game is still rampant with crashes. Expect to be having to restart the game every 10-20 minutes.",quit peopl game doesnt make past first cinemat ive tri stuff peopl said onlin tell hasnt address develop yet disappoint look forward game updat review ever get fix dont recommend game due fact may unplay playersedit intro cinemat crash fix game still rampant crash expect restart game everi minut
"This game has many strengths but unfortunately fails in the most crucial aspect........the combat.Playing on veteran (intended difficulty) fails as delivering the power fantasy of mowing down hordes of foes and brutally destroying worthy foes with consummate skill. The armour generating mechanic works but even horde enemies do so much damage it is often depleted immediately. The health regen mechanic just doesn't work - constantly getting downed, scrounging for medicae packs and spamming ultimate ability as much as possible just get some health back the core game play loop. Titus feel sluggish and the enemies are too bullet spongy. The combat just feels 'off'.That being said, as a huge Warhammer fan, I loved the graphics, voice acting, musical score and the atmosphere of the game.Just a shame about the actual game play loop.Only get if you love 40k enough to overlook the flaws.",game mani strength unfortun fail crucial aspectth combatplay veteran intend difficulti fail deliv power fantasi mow hord foe brutal destroy worthi foe consumm skill armour gener mechan work even hord enemi much damag often deplet immedi health regen mechan doesnt work constantli get down scroung medica pack spam ultim abil much possibl get health back core game play loop titu feel sluggish enemi bullet spongi combat feel offthat said huge warhamm fan love graphic voic act music score atmospher gamejust shame actual game play looponli get love enough overlook flaw

"2022 I have never enjoyed a Souls game before for a variety of reasons. I generally do not enjoy open-world games, as they tend to feel shallow and unrewarding. And yet, I greatly enjoy Elden Ring. I have like over 100 hours in it and haven't even finished the game yet (but I am getting close!), and have no intention of putting it down any time soon - it is the most well put-together open-world game I've ever played, and I think that they very successfully adapted the Souls core into an open-world format.The combat is tough, but as an open world game you can always go explore and level or find a new build if you find yourself up against a wall. If things suck, hit da bricks. The world feels generally rewarding of exploration and filled with ways to tweak builds or upgrade items or have better/more heals, and you genuinely have the tools at your disposal to make the game easier. If you ever feel like you're throwing yourself at a wall, you probably are! You should go find a ladder or another way around it!The game isn't perfect (no 21:9 or >60fps without launching the game 'offline' with anticheat disabled, some inputs are not rebindable on kb+m (e.g. map) which makes playing with my split keyboard impossible - which is fine, I wouldn't play a souls game without a controller anyways) to name a few minor complaints), but generally, the core game itself is almost perfect on its own. Most of the issues are just in how it's packaged up.",never enjoy soul game varieti reason gener enjoy openworld game tend feel shallow unreward yet greatli enjoy elden ring like hour havent even finish game yet get close intent put time soon well puttogeth openworld game ive ever play think success adapt soul core openworld formatth combat tough open world game alway go explor level find new build find wall thing suck hit da brick world feel gener reward explor fill way tweak build upgrad item bettermor heal genuin tool dispos make game easier ever feel like your throw wall probabl go find ladder anoth way around itth game isnt perfect without launch game offlin anticheat disabl input rebind kbm eg map make play split keyboard imposs fine wouldnt play soul game without control anyway name minor complaint gener core game almost perfect issu packag

"The game is fun, I'm having trouble with the rendering with invisible enemies and such. Had to drop resolution to fix. Aside from that, the game isn't buggy haven't seen any game breaking stuff.Story wise, the game highlights each factions best points from the lore's and novels. My one gripe is just how textbook the chaos antagonist is and how short we fought the tyranids, would've loved to see more of them since they are the biggest threat in the current setting.The main antagonists are not very talkative which only made me wish we fought khorne's faction instead or even orcs since they are alot more comical and much more entertaining. I'm currently hoping that the new enemies in season 3 & 4 are the talkative bunch like orcs or khorne.Side note, the guardsmen are pretty badass and would love to see more of them in new missions, if not maybe different space marine chapters like imperial fists or black templars.Overall, the game is good fun, holding the line be it with your battle brothers or with the cadians makes your adrenaline run.

"What sucks is that this game is incredibly fun to play. Home building, combat is decent, exploration is good.They nailed allot of the ""feel"" of this game and the different game play elements.What they failed at is the arbitrary server wipes that are not advertised in the game and not advertised in the promotional material leading up to it's launch. There so far hasn't been a good reason given for the server wipes other than ""all players will be on a level playing field"" which for a game that is largely PvE with PvP aspects, makes zero sense.The biggest negative thing about this game is the server wipe mechanic and honestly, your character having zero persistance beyond the things you find makes the time you invested into the game meaningless. It's a massive time sink of farming items, finding items, collecting energy credits, leveling up, crafting items, ect. All to have it wiped so you can level up to farm more items to build better guns that will help you farm more items to help you build better guns.It's a waste of time in it's current design. Hopefully in the future they change this and offer servers or game modes that have character persistance.I feel like the wipe mechanic solves a problem that never existed and is a cheep gimmick",suck game incred fun play home build combat decent explor goodthey nail allot feel game differ game play elementswhat fail arbitrari server wipe advertis game advertis promot materi lead launch far hasnt good reason given server wipe player level play field game larg pve pvp aspect make zero senseth biggest neg thing game server wipe mechan honestli charact zero persist beyond thing find make time invest game meaningless massiv time sink farm item find item collect energi credit level craft item ect wipe level farm item build better gun help farm item help build better gunsit wast time current design hope futur chang offer server game mode charact persistancei feel like wipe mechan solv problem never exist cheep gimmick

It probably includes Mortal Empires.But the rosters, campaigns, the prologue, all of this is great additions. Diplomacy has good additions, MP is finally usable, and they've improved on a fair few things that the community wanted.Now, the UI is pretty awful. Wait for a mod to come and fix it, but its hard to read (red on red on red on red on red), and its scaled improperly. Other than that, I like most of it.

"2023 Sadly this game is barely maintained.Terrible patch-cycle, where gamebreaking bugs remain for months.Paired with predatory dlc-politics, where each new dlc has less content and costs more, than the previous one, this feels more and more like a low-effort cash grab.All this, together with tone-deaf public announcements about how necessary this step is because of financial reasons, while posting record profits.For the longest time, this was tolerable. With the latest dlc (about half the content for roughly +150% the price) I just can't recommend this game anymore, since the (buggy and barely maintained) base-game is just not enough.",sadli game bare maintainedterr patchcycl gamebreak bug remain monthspair predatori dlcpolit new dlc less content cost previou one feel like loweffort cash grabal togeth tonedeaf public announc necessari step financi reason post record profitsfor longest time toler latest dlc half content roughli price cant recommend game anymor sinc buggi bare maintain basegam enough
"I hope they get another chance.Space Marine 2 is a testament both to audacity and to love. It is insane to think that an also-ran 3rd person shooter from the middle of the first Obama Administration, which had a famously killed any studio that touched it is getting a sequel. It's equally insane that the game has been sculpted with the meticulous care and reverence for the material that legitimately bring the 41st Millenium into breathing, screaming, bloody life. Space Marine 2 bleeds love for the source material, bleeds competence from almost every angle, I play Space Marine 2, and I see how from the white-paper it might be the greatest squad based shooter of all time.If only any of it's elements cooperated with one another. If you can reliably bully two other people into playing with you, I am reasonably assured you will have a good time. The game is built, from the ground up, under the impression that your coworkers will be able to make quick, intelligent decisions, obey orders, and work in perfect sync with you. It's the Space Marine fantasy writ large, a small group of transhuman warriors overcoming the ravenous alien hordes with coordination, brotherhood, and grotesque acts of ultra-violence. I play the game, I go through the obvious multiplayer points, the Control Points, the King of the Hill, the Protect the NPC bits, and I imagine what it would be like to work with two others of equal investment.But that isn't the world you will get. You will get two of the most infamously terrible AI companions to have ever graced the medium and a game that makes no compromises for it. If you bring the AI companions, you will be alone. You will carry out every objective, you will carry every important item, and you will need to personally hold every point because without a human controller, your other marines will sometimes manage to use their guns successfully, but more often then not will abandon you to the heart of the swarm while they chase ineffectually after snipers. I can not overstate this enough, the game is completely based around interlocking fields of fire, the ability to trust that the people behind you can work in synchronicity with you. If you can trust your companions to keep the swarm off you while you duel synapse creatures to death, you will be living the Space Marine fantasy. If you can't, you will die horribly, miserably, consistently. And that's just not the experience I was looking for. I'd rather not have to hunt down others to make the game baseline playable, it isn't exactly the experience advertised.But saying that, I admire so much about the design. The world is rightfully lauded elsewhere, you don't need me to tell you that every slithering beast and battle-scarred tank is rendered with texture and loving detail. You know that already. What fascinates me is the game design, how close it comes to working and how far it falls behind it's goals.The regenerating armour system, a set of ablative HP that regenerates when you perform executions or pistol parries encourages you to stay in the fight and play not just well, but excellently. If you can master the duels you get into, catch the perfect parries and the perfect dodges and respond in time with bursts of catastrophic damage from your counter-shots, you will be invulnerable and your enemies will die quickly and badly. You enter a state that can only really be described as gunkata, and it's exactly what it should be.And then your AI companions will run away, you will get surrounded, and you will die. Again and again. The game is close to being great, and I've been far kinder to much worse games, but the experience is so badly hampered by just a few small mistakes that bring the whole thing down. I can't recommend it in it's current state, and I wish I could.

"The world building and map design in this game is actually phenomenal. Its hard to do justice to the immense size and scale of Warhammer settings, but this game achieves it. Mechanicus forges feel true to the lore, the Tyranid enemy feels like an unstoppable tide, and the Spacemarines you are playing feel like the super soldiers they are supposed to be. If you are buying this game for the campaign and story you will not be disappointed, 40k/10. The Eternal War 6v6 multiplayer game mode feels like an extra, its somewhat entertaining but do not expect it to be what you come for in this title.

"2023 This is my favourite game series and I've been buying all DLCs since 2016, the first game is the reason I got into gaming in the first place, and it has been an amazing journey, 7 years of discovering the Warhammer Fantasy world and the Total Wat games, 7 years of non-stop content at a reasonable price, it was perfect. But then this game came along, it started a bit ""meh"" with the Realms of Chaos campaing not being the best but it was beareable. Then Inmortal Empires comes, for free, and an new DLC which introduced an insane ammount of content to multiple races for just a little less than a regular race pack. Up until this point everything was amazing, the game had it's issues but it's still the franchise I love and I've put thousands of hours into, but then, Chaos Dwarfs came in. One less Legendary Lord, from the usual 4 down to 3, and in exchange one Legendary Hereo. This aswell came with the news that the usual free Legendary Lord that accompanied DLC releases were going to be replaced with Legendary Heroes. And the most important part, the price went up from 19 euros, to 25. ""It's not that bad"" I thought, yeah, there is one less Legendary Lord but at least we got a Legendary Heore, and the race is quite fun to play. And yeah, we didn't get a free Legendary Lord, but a Heroe is more than nothing right ? And yeah, the gmae may be a little to messy and filled with bugs, but it's a big game, this things happen. I was a fool. Early Augost, 2023, the Shadows of Change DLC is announced, Lords pack go from introducing 2 Legendary Lords and featuring 2 races to 3. Then they announce a new Legendary Heore in the DLC, and it would come with 12 new units, old Lord packs usually came with 6-9. Well, in reality 9 new units beocuse one was a generic lord option, for one of the featured races, old Lord packs usually came with one aswell, maybe even one per race, another one was a new generic heroe option, again, nothing new, and the last one was a Legendary Heroe for the last race, again, some of the old Lord packs also included 1, or even 2 Legendary Heroes, nothing new. Then a change in price is revealed. An increase to be exact. ""An additional 20%, 30% at best, increase in content delivered ? Probably 14 or15 euros ? 16 if they feel extra greedy ?"" I tohught. No, not even close. 25 f*cking euros. What ? Whaaat ?! This is a joke ! It's is straight up non-sensical and in the pitiful ammount of additional content, compared to previous Lord packs, does in no way, shape or form justify a 150% increase in price. This new DLC has nowhere near as much content as the previous race pack, and even that one was a little overpriced at 25 euros.I love this game and I want it to succeed and I want it to keep recieving content for the years to come, but not at that price. They have betrayed the player base asking too much for too little and alll due to greed. And the sadest part is that this is not this DLC, it's all DLC going foward. No more free Legendary Lords, no more 4 Legenadry Lords per race pack, no more high quality 10 euros Lord packs.I love this game, and I want to recomend it, I really do, but after this backstab ? I can't. And the real problem isn't the price, but what it means, that greed has overcome the game, and I, thankfully, am in a position where I can buy the DLC, I could spend the 25 euros they want and I probably would put docens, if not houndreds of hours into the DLC, but I wont, becouse it is not about the money, it is about sending a mesage.

"2022 This may just be the best game ever made, though that might be a bit biased since I love Soulsborne so much. It's a combo of all the best parts of Fromsoft's past games mashed into one delicious full course meal.There seem to be a lot of people experiencing performance issues but at least on the rigs I've tested the game on I didn't have any major issues with stuttering nearly ever (RTX 3070 and i7 9700k, GTX 1660 Ti and Xeon E3-1231v3, GTX 970 and i5 9500, 16GB RAM on all).If you think it might not run well on your rig then by all means wait for an optimization patch, they always release one around a month after their games release. But for the love of god it isn't worth review bombing over, especially when games that run like complete dogwater get rave reviews regardless. People just want Elden Ring to fail because of 2042 and 2077 I swear.",may best game ever made though might bit bias sinc love soulsborn much combo best part fromsoft past game mash one delici full cours mealther seem lot peopl experienc perform issu least rig ive test game didnt major issu stutter nearli ever rtx gtx ti xeon gtx ram allif think might run well rig mean wait optim patch alway releas one around month game releas love god isnt worth review bomb especi game run like complet dogwat get rave review regardless peopl want elden ring fail swear

"2022 Total War Warhammer 3 is the latest game in the grand strategy franchise where the player will command armies containing thousands of soldiers in real time battles, while also managing their empire on the turn based world map.This is the 7th Total War game I’ve played, following both previous Warhammers, Shogun 2, Rome 2, Three Kingdoms, and Troy. While I enjoy the real world historical games, the Warhammer games are my favourites because of the variety provided by the different races, which helps to keep lengthy campaigns interesting. Immortal EmpiresI’m basing this review on the Immortal Empires campaign, where the maps from all three Warhammer games have been combined into one giant world map featuring every faction who has appeared in the franchise. Most of my time has been spent playing as the Grand Cathay faction led by Zhao Ming.The scale of this campaign is incredible. I’ve eliminated a faction of Cathay rebels, Skaven, Dark Elves, Ogres, Nurgle, Chaos, and two factions of Vampires, who all thought it was a good idea to declare war on me, plus a couple of Beastmen armies who were raiding in my territory.I’ve got alliances with three neighbouring Cathay factions. One is defending the Great Bastion (which reminds me of The Wall in Game of Thrones) from Chaos armies to the north, while the other two have expanded south through lands previously held by Lizardmen. They’ve helped to keep my borders mostly secure, allowing me to focus on fighting all these wars.Between us we now own 65 settlements, I’ve earned the short victory, and if I confederated my allies I’d be close to the long victory. Its taken 45 hours and 138 turns to reach this point, often fighting multiple battles per turn. And there are still 91 other factions on the map. On my western border, High Elves are fighting more Skaven, while some Greenskins have attempted to invade my empire twice. I’ve also had to defend my north western border against multiple attacks by another Chaos faction led by Archaon the Everchosen (the final boss of the first game). Meanwhile, in lands so far to the west that I can’t even imagine how long it would take me to get there, are large empires belonging to the Tomb Kings, Dwarves, Wood Elves, Slaanesh, and the Empire. All hail mighty Grand Cathay! A Screenshot of Total War: WARHAMMER III By: G00N3R Varied FactionsCathay’s playing style feels like a typical Total War campaign where I’m capturing settlements, constructing buildings to upgrade my economy and fund more armies to further extend my empire. Their armies have a good all round mixture of melee, ranged, and cavalry units. But they also have some unique features.They can send trade caravans to the capital cities of friendly western empires to earn big profits. But enemy armies, especially Ogres in the mountains, can attack the caravans during their journey.They have to pay attention to harmony, where most buildings, generals, research and events favour either yin or yang. When they’re balanced you get bonuses to income, growth and control (public order), but when yin/yang are unbalanced, you start to get penalties.And every few turns you can choose which direction to set the Wu Xing Compass, which controls the winds of magic. This is almost entirely a positive thing which lets you get bonuses depending on what you’re planning to do over the next few turns. Reduce recruitment cost if you want to raise a new army, increase replenishment when you’re fighting lots of battles, increase income if your economy is struggling, increase control to avoid rebellions, or reduce corruption when you’re capturing territory that has been held by vampires or chaos factions such as Nurgle.I’ve also spent around 10 hours playing as Skarbrand’s Exiles of Khorne, whose tactics feel very different. To be honest I’m not sure I fully understand how to play them, but I’m starting to have some success. Their armies lack ranged units and are focused on strong melee and cavalry, but the biggest difference is how their economy works. They don’t earn much money from buildings, and their units are very expensive to recruit, so it feels like capturing territory is a waste of time because I’d never be able to support enough armies to defend a large empire.Instead I think the correct tactic is to have a couple of armies quickly rampaging around the map from one settlement to the next, sacking to earn enough money to pay upkeep, and razing to either earn skulls needed to research new tech, or spawn medium size temporary armies for free, who automatically disband after a few turns, but give you a short term boost to military strength.So while Cathay is about building and expanding, Khorne is focused on destruction, which feels appropriate for a faction belonging to the blood god. And this illustrates how the different factions don’t just have units that look unique, they offer very varied playing experiences, which provides a lot of replay potential.TechnicalSo far the game has crashed 3 times, but I suppose that’s actually pretty good for 60 hours of playing time in a campaign that is still labelled as a beta. I haven’t noticed any other bugs and I’ve had no problems with framerate. Even though there are hundreds of factions, armies and settlements on the map, the end turn process moves quite fast.The visual design and animations for all the different units is really good. And I like how the appearance of the world map changes based on its level of corruption, from green grass and trees, to a scorched wasteland.RecommendationWarhammer 3 is an excellent game that veteran Total War players will most likely enjoy. The scale of the Immortal Empires campaign is easily worth a full price purchase, assuming you already own the previous Warhammer games.As reaction to this game’s story campaign (which I haven’t tried yet) was quite negative, new players would probably have more fun by starting with Warhammer 1 and 2, which both have strong story campaigns.",total war warhamm latest game grand strategi franchis player command armi contain thousand soldier real time battl also manag empir turn base world mapthi total war game ive play follow previou warhamm shogun rome three kingdom troy enjoy real world histor game warhamm game favourit varieti provid differ race help keep lengthi campaign interest immort empiresim base review immort empir campaign map three warhamm game combin one giant world map featur everi faction appear franchis time spent play grand cathay faction led zhao mingth scale campaign incred ive elimin faction cathay rebel skaven dark elv ogr nurgl chao two faction vampir thought good idea declar war plu coupl beastmen armi raid territory got allianc three neighbour cathay faction one defend great bastion remind wall game throne chao armi north two expand south land previous held lizardmen theyv help keep border mostli secur allow focu fight warsbetween us settlement ive earn short victori confeder alli id close long victori taken hour turn reach point often fight multipl battl per turn still faction map western border high elv fight skaven greenskin attempt invad empir twice ive also defend north western border multipl attack anoth chao faction led archaon everchosen final boss first game meanwhil land far west cant even imagin long would take get larg empir belong tomb king dwarv wood elv slaanesh empir hail mighti grand cathay screenshot total war warhamm iii vari factionscathay play style feel like typic total war campaign im captur settlement construct build upgrad economi fund armi extend empir armi good round mixtur mele rang cavalri unit also uniqu featuresthey send trade caravan capit citi friendli western empir earn big profit enemi armi especi ogr mountain attack caravan journeythey pay attent harmoni build gener research event favour either yin yang theyr balanc get bonus incom growth control public order yinyang unbalanc start get penaltiesand everi turn choos direct set wu xing compass control wind magic almost entir posit thing let get bonus depend your plan next turn reduc recruit cost want rais new armi increas replenish your fight lot battl increas incom economi struggl increas control avoid rebellion reduc corrupt your captur territori held vampir chao faction nurgleiv also spent around hour play skarbrand exil khorn whose tactic feel differ honest im sure fulli understand play im start success armi lack rang unit focus strong mele cavalri biggest differ economi work dont earn much money build unit expens recruit feel like captur territori wast time id never abl support enough armi defend larg empireinstead think correct tactic coupl armi quickli rampag around map one settlement next sack earn enough money pay upkeep raze either earn skull need research new tech spawn medium size temporari armi free automat disband turn give short term boost militari strengthso cathay build expand khorn focus destruct feel appropri faction belong blood god illustr differ faction dont unit look uniqu offer vari play experi provid lot replay potentialtechnicalso far game crash time suppos that actual pretti good hour play time campaign still label beta havent notic bug ive problem framer even though hundr faction armi settlement map end turn process move quit fastth visual design anim differ unit realli good like appear world map chang base level corrupt green grass tree scorch wastelandrecommendationwarhamm excel game veteran total war player like enjoy scale immort empir campaign easili worth full price purchas assum alreadi previou warhamm gamesa reaction game stori campaign havent tri yet quit neg new player would probabl fun start warhamm strong stori campaign

"Did not expect the game to be this good, very polished combat, variety builds(you have free infinite respec to change your combat style anytime you want), bosses are really unique as well. Surprisingly lots of hidden secrets and side quests, best part is you can backtrack and do all the side quest even after completing the chapter.9/10 would be nice if we have more exploration instead of linear progression path but this is just personal preferences. Also Chapter 4 is peak.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update after 100hours of playtime: I've completed pretty much everything the game can offer, except maxing out all Spirits and Equipments (you need about NG+5 to get enough Knot of Voidness for all Spirits upgrade). I like how the game gives you a secret stance but require a lot of work for it, too bad it can't last long (That's what she said).You definitely don't need to do new playthrough but highly recommend trying out NG+1 as you get some new stuff to play with. The scaling for NG+3 onwards is a bit 'unbalanced' as you pretty much hit the cap of scaling of your damage/defence but enemies/bosses just scale harder than you, which can makes it a bit unfun.Still a great game, prob GOTY 2024 for me.",expect game good polish combat varieti buildsyou free infinit respec chang combat style anytim want boss realli uniqu well surprisingli lot hidden secret side quest best part backtrack side quest even complet would nice explor instead linear progress path person prefer also chapter peakupd playtim ive complet pretti much everyth game offer except max spirit equip need get enough knot void spirit upgrad like game give secret stanc requir lot work bad cant last long that saidyou definit dont need new playthrough highli recommend tri get new stuff play scale onward bit unbalanc pretti much hit cap scale damagedef enemiesboss scale harder make bit unfunstil great game prob goti

"Black Myth: Wukong is the kind of game that comes once in a generation revolutionizing the industry. The fidelity and effects powered by UE5 are breathtaking. The developers have clearly poured their hearts into creating this magnificent piece of art. The influence it created around Sun Wukong and Chinese mythology is insane. This isn’t just a boss rush game as some have claimed. Instead it plays like a sweet child of God of War (2018) and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (2019) in a unique way. I played for 70 hours straight for a week and there wasn’t a single dull moment. The animated cutscenes at the end of each chapter, the story, the combat, the exploration, the rewards, the atmosphere and the boss designs were all so good making this experience etched to my heart. It even inspired me to start reading Journey to the West while playing. 10/10 - Potential Game of the year 2024",black myth wukong kind game come gener revolution industri fidel effect power breathtak develop clearli pour heart creat magnific piec art influenc creat around sun wukong chines mytholog insan isnt boss rush game claim instead play like sweet child god war sekiro shadow die twice uniqu way play hour straight week wasnt singl dull moment anim cutscen end chapter stori combat explor reward atmospher boss design good make experi etch heart even inspir start read journey west play potenti game year

"The game is damn fun with friends.

"I absolutely love the art direction in this game .. the original style and references to Journey from the West is very refreshing for a game.. A company that focuses on the game play and the story and not politics is also a breath of fresh air for this often stale ""tech"" industry .. so well done Game Science.. for keeping it real ..A couple of Gripes i have while playing the game have to be mentioned.. 1. Inability to replay cut scenes.. There is only one chance to see a boss cut scene .. after you have triggered the boss once .. you always see the boss spawned in the area ..where you found it .. this takes a little bit away from the ability to keep the story front and centre in the game players experience.. Usual way would be to replay the cut scene each time .. and give the player the option of skipping the cut scene when it plays .. if they want to get straight to the action.. Many many many times in this game i have wandered into some open area only to find myself smack bang in the middle of a boss fight i didnt anticipate .. didnt have time to buff.. didnt have any idea that it was going to be a boss.. this is a bit of a problem because most times this means you DEFINITELY have to re do the boss.. you might have no health no manna no focus .. and you are forced into a boss scene with out any ability to actually prepare to beat the Boss..2. The Cut scenes from boss kill scenes i found are often jerky .. that is they do not transition smoothly .. i would assume this is a technical problem with the way UE5 handles going from rendered video playback to real time action .. 3. NPC enemies often replenish health when you run from an area where they spawn .. but can still see them .. Many times ive almost taken down a tough enemy .. and run away to heal .. in order to be able to finish him off.. only to find that when i return .. (not very far away) the enemy i just beat down to a sliver of his HP has totally replenished all of his HP.. this makes the game a bit annoying.. i wonder if anyone else has experienced this ..There are some other minor UI issues .. Such as the Wind spell / Fire protection Buff .. being assigned to the Left Stick and RT .. this basically means that any time you are moving as you move with the Left stick .. you are very likely to trigger this move when you are TRYING to trigger a spell .. because by default you are MOVING when you hold RT .. to trigger a spell like Imobilize and instead you end up using the wind charm .. first.. it would be better to assign this to the Left Bumper as it seems to be assigned to nothing ?.. I am more than half way through chapter 4 and really do enjoy the game .. apart from a few of these technical quirks .. that could be improved for better game play experience.. Respect to Game Science for creating a completely unique world .. in this game .. where the player can immerse themselves in the story and enjoy overcoming challenging and rewarding Bosses and enemies alike..i Would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes these kinds of games..and no its NOT a ""soulslike"" ..:)",absolut love art direct game origin style refer journey west refresh game compani focus game play stori polit also breath fresh air often stale tech industri well done game scienc keep real coupl gripe play game mention inabl replay cut scene one chanc see boss cut scene trigger boss alway see boss spawn area found take littl bit away abil keep stori front centr game player experi usual way would replay cut scene time give player option skip cut scene play want get straight action mani mani mani time game wander open area find smack bang middl boss fight didnt anticip didnt time buff didnt idea go boss bit problem time mean definit boss might health manna focu forc boss scene abil actual prepar beat cut scene boss kill scene found often jerki transit smoothli would assum technic problem way handl go render video playback real time action npc enemi often replenish health run area spawn still see mani time ive almost taken tough enemi run away heal order abl finish find return far away enemi beat sliver hp total replenish hp make game bit annoy wonder anyon els experienc minor ui issu wind spell fire protect buff assign left stick rt basic mean time move move left stick like trigger move tri trigger spell default move hold rt trigger spell like imobil instead end use wind charm first would better assign left bumper seem assign noth half way chapter realli enjoy game apart technic quirk could improv better game play experi respect game scienc creat complet uniqu world game player immers stori enjoy overcom challeng reward boss enemi alikei would definit recommend anyon like kind gamesand soulslik
"In initial experience as a Chinese proficient, the art, lines, and music are particularly shocking. I watch the English clip online and believe their translation is also pretty good. Though, if you can read and speak Chinese, the lines are unrivaled in video game history. It is not a flaunt or exaggeration or something, but probably the truth. A notable flaw is the path design, which reminds me of Team Ninja's works... (but I love Ninja's games lol)Apart from all the details, it should be the largest action game in the history of video games to date. There are no reasons for not giving it a try as a gamer.",initi experi chines profici art line music particularli shock watch english clip onlin believ translat also pretti good though read speak chines line unriv video game histori flaunt exagger someth probabl truth notabl flaw path design remind team ninja work love ninja game lolapart detail largest action game histori video game date reason give tri gamer

"2022 The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.StrategyHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distractedA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.",hog rider card unlock spell valley arena fast buildingtarget mele troop moder high hitpoint damag appear like clash clan counterpart man brown eyebrow beard mohawk golden bodi pierc left ear ride hog hog rider card cost elixir deploystrategyhi fast move speed boost forward mini tank like ice golem push time also function tank lower hitpoint troop goblin still fair amount health cheap swarm complement hog rider well nearli fast usual forc one card oppon handth hog rider struggl swarm damag defeat quickli obstruct path barbarian particular fulli counter without strict time defend part though wari spellsa hunter kill hog rider hit place right top howev place someth front hog rider hunter splash damag hog rider hit card front moreth hog rider conjunct freez surpris oppon allow hog rider deal much damag anticip especi oppon goto counter swarm swarm effect counter skeleton bat immedi defeat spell spear goblin goblin minion low enough health defeat follow zap giant snowballhowev strategi isnt effect build hog rider take destroy build give oppon ampl time articul anoth counteragainst nonswarm troop deal lot damag freez time allow oppon set massiv counterpush reason player either go hog rider freez unit back counterattack match end need deal much damag possibleit good idea send hog rider simpli destroy build especi build target unit avail defeat crown tower becom substanti difficult spell simpli wait lifetim build effect except elixir collector place front king tower hog rider place bridg destroy collector posit elixir trade though damag princess tower usual mean surviv deal damag howev oppon send defend troop opportun gain spell damag valuein deck sever lowcost card might worth simpli send hog rider one build deck shuffl card rotat quick enough arriv next hog rider next build arriv oppon card rotationlongrang troop like musket fli machin snipe build preserv hog rider health possibl allow get tower damagewhen build place middl counter hog rider understand placement hog rider type build place help hog rider bypass certain buildingspass build spawner elixir collector larger hitbox defens build mean passiv build place tile away river middl oppon side imposs hog rider bypass placement hog rider get pull buildingdefens build smaller hitbox passiv build mean defens build place three tile away river middl oppon side hog rider place left right side arena may abl bypass due smaller hitboxif player build alreadi place center arena oppon tri bypass hog rider edg arena use certain air troop push hog rider toward build jump river effect deni bypass attempt must alreadi hover correct placement quick reflex requir correctli perform techniquefor bat skeleton dragon minion hord place right front hog rider soon deployedfor minion skeleton barrel mega minion fli machin electro dragon babi dragon inferno dragon balloon lava hound stagger placement one tile right hog rider place left side arena vice versathey also use ground troop achiev result someth like ice golem deploy hog rider land spot obstruct path forc go around unit caus closer build instead crown towerth hog rider kite fast nonbuild target troop due fast speed build target place fourth tile bridg slightli opposit lane also stall ground unit place right bridg pull toward deploy untarget jump bridg land pull back use player need deal damag lane defend also help separ troop behind tank larg pusha tornado place second tile front player king tower stagger two tile toward princess tower activ without damag dealt princess tower help defend futur push also method mitig damag dealt princess tower three time may result king tower health low enough target directli open possibl threat back door three crown better altern pull hog away princess tower attack rang three crown tower negat damag long none alreadi distracteda power combo hog rider musket valkyri typic refer trifecta musket defend troop valkyri protect hog rider swarm high damag unit hog rider use deal damag towerthi effect counter lightn oneshot musket sever damag valkyri hog rider minion hord also effect enemi zap musket oneshot even musket defeat hog rider valkyri enough time sever damag towerth hog rider place behind valkyri give boost stay front hog rider protect ita hog rider combin goblin barrel awkward oppon defend time hog rider tank tower shot goblin effect way deal damag howev barbarian barrel shut minim tower damag posit elixir trade long goblin barrel place directli tower

I won't support you in the future until you unban that modder and make apologize to the community. For god's sake, if you wanna sell the DLC with a higher price, at least you gotta give us the quality it should have. Unban Stompie! This is not an advice, or you will lose all your fans eventually.

"I installed the game via Steam and found several concerning issues:- Multiple unrecognized startup applications are created, including a screen recording software (ScreenRec).- The game requests administrator permissions every time it launches.- Suspicious registry entries in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ScreenRec, pointing to screen recorder malware.These issues suggest the game might be harmful, potentially acting as malware.

"Compared to the first game, this is a real disappointment. The campaign thus far is solid (I haven't completed it yet), but it's a coop campaign not true single player - your choice is 3-player (strange number) coop, or single player with two bots. From what I've heard, the campaign is very short too.Operations and Eternal War, on the other hand, are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There are only three maps for Eternal War, and they're all Control Point maps - changing game mode just lets you play really bad deathmatch on a map clearly designed for control points, or ""what if the control points moved to ♥♥♥♥ spots every 100 seconds"" gamemode. It is 2024, and not only is there no spawn protect/covered spawn locations, but teams switch their spawn points periodically in the match... With no real rhyme or reason. So you'll spawn, then immediately get killed because spawn points switched and an enemy team member spawned behind you. The maps are also much smaller than the first game, with 6v6 instead of 8v8 gameplay. And there is no Dreadnought Game Mode, because the design notes for PVP seem to begin and end at ""Halo Infinite, but make it worse."" The Khorne Berserker/Vanguard Marine even has an inexplicable grappling hook.Operations, I have only tried the first mission; I figured it had to be good, because the single player was good. But no, gone are the hordes of Tyranids, instead you're walking from clearing to clearing fighting packs of three to five Tyranid Warriors. The Assault Marine's jump pack has been nerfed to the point of uselessness because the maps aren't designed for it, so enjoy that one piece of equipment working nothing like it does in other game modes.On top of all this, Chaos Marines in PVP get next to no customization options. If you're an Assault Marine, you are a Night Lord, or a Night Lord but painted red. The only reward you really get in the PVP is unlocking new colours and customization options, but they might as well not even exist if the queue decides to put you on the Chaos team.All in all, a big disappointment, I'm probably going to reinstall Space Marine 1 and wait for some patches, but short of a total rework I doubt the PVP is salvageable.",compar first game real disappoint campaign thu far solid havent complet yet coop campaign true singl player choic strang number coop singl player two bot ive heard campaign short toooper etern war hand three map etern war theyr control point map chang game mode let play realli bad deathmatch map clearli design control point control point move spot everi second gamemod spawn protectcov spawn locat team switch spawn point period match real rhyme reason youll spawn immedi get kill spawn point switch enemi team member spawn behind map also much smaller first game instead gameplay dreadnought game mode design note pvp seem begin end halo infinit make wors khorn berserkervanguard marin even inexplic grappl hookoper tri first mission figur good singl player good gone hord tyranid instead your walk clear clear fight pack three five tyranid warrior assault marin jump pack nerf point useless map arent design enjoy one piec equip work noth like game modeson top chao marin pvp get next custom option your assault marin night lord night lord paint red reward realli get pvp unlock new colour custom option might well even exist queue decid put chao teamal big disappoint im probabl go reinstal space marin wait patch short total rework doubt pvp salvag

"2022 Would only recommend if you own the first two Warhammer titles since you can't access immortal empires without them. Base Warhammer 3 is overpriced for what it gives you and isn't at all like a normal total war title in the way of global domination, it's more of a race to the objective with the AI having easier objectives than you to do the same thing. Immortal Empires is the main game mode if you're use to playing Total War titles which is full domination. Runs a lot better than Warhammer 2 since it's playable now. There has been monthly patches for balancing and multiplayer features for their other game modes that they're trying so very hard to make a thing (spoilers: it won't be). I wish CA would drop the competitive multiplayer scene modes and just focus on what everyone wanted in the first place which was Immortal Empires but whatever, they'll learn the same way Relic did. If you can't tell, because of Immortal Empires the actual game rating went from mostly negative to positive. If that isn't an indicator that their fanbase only wants one thing then I guess nothing will. I'm sure CA will sell the positive reviews to their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ other game modes and try and promote them still anyway.",would recommend first two warhamm titl sinc cant access immort empir without base warhamm overpr give isnt like normal total war titl way global domin race object ai easier object thing immort empir main game mode your use play total war titl full domin run lot better warhamm sinc playabl monthli patch balanc multiplay featur game mode theyr tri hard make thing spoiler wont wish ca would drop competit multiplay scene mode focu everyon want first place immort empir whatev theyll learn way relic cant tell immort empir actual game rate went mostli neg posit isnt indic fanbas want one thing guess noth im sure ca sell posit review game mode tri promot still anyway
"I spent 70 hours on this game since launch, got to level 42 and everything was going really well! I purchase the battle pass for my character and was having a lot of fun with the game!! With a free game you can live with minor bugs and glitches and you move on. But on the 15/07 i Teleported to my hive mates base and was placed under the map! the game then went into an infinite loading loop, giving me half a second to control my character before loading screen again. It has been doing this now for nearly 48 hours. My character is stuck under the map and the most help i received from support is ""Reinstall the game"" because we all know that character location information on a live online game is stored client side. Until this is fixed there is no way i can recommend this game to anybody because at this point its unplayable for me.Update: 24 hours after the initial review, and a server maintenance my character is still unplayable and stuck under the map!Update 23/07/2024 - Character is still stuck under the map.

"I want to recommend this game, I really do. But this is not an $80 game. Campaign took 5 hours, good story. Gameplay feels good, graphics are great. PvE is garbage right now, servers crap out on you. Just spent almost 2 hours trying to queue for a match and every time I got in it would disconnect me. I only made it into an actual game once, I killed two Rubric Marines and then was disconnected. PvP doesn't appeal to me so I haven't tried that, and likely won't.I want more value from an $80 game than a 5hr campaign and a multiplayer that doesn't work. And they want seasons on top of that, slowly trickle out content that might have made this an $80 game over the next few years. If you can pick this up for half price or lower then you should grab this game, or maybe wait a year or two for the content to catch up to the price.",want recommend game realli game campaign took hour good stori gameplay feel good graphic great pve garbag right server crap spent almost hour tri queue match everi time got would disconnect made actual game kill two rubric marin disconnect pvp doesnt appeal havent tri like wonti want valu game campaign multiplay doesnt work want season top slowli trickl content might made game next year pick half price lower grab game mayb wait year two content catch price
"2022 Elden Ring, or How I Learned to Stop Hating Soulsbornes and Praise the Dog I'll be completely honest with you, I've never had the best relationship with FromSoftware; Yeah, their games were aesthetically pleasing but honestly the gameplay wasn't really my thing. Was it because they were hard? No. They're punishing, sure, but once you understood how the game worked everything was quite easy. It was ultimately the fandom at the time that consisted of snobs that threw around ""git gud"" without actually offering any advice on what was mostly a single-player experience that turned me away from these sort of games.Then a friend gifted me a copy of this game. (Thanks again, btw. You know who you are.)My expectations were low and that's what blew my mind with this game in the first place. Eld of the Rings honestly felt like a huge improvement from the other Soulsborne titles. Is Eldward Ringscorhands hard? Oh yeah, no doubt about it. But no longer was I stuck in the same area spending hours grinding the same few enemies if I couldn't overcome a boss just so I could level up; I can now just hop on my horse, explore a part of the map I never found before, have a little adventure and come back when I feel like I'm ready to take on whatever to progress the story. Mechanics that have been present since Demon's Souls didn't feel like using a pool noodle in comparison to whatever weapon you were using. Dark Souls: Breath of the Wild feels more flexible in comparison to it's predecessors when it comes to how you want to play and what you want to do.And it's probably time to address something I've been asking myself for a while; Where are all the sweatlord Dark Souls veterans gatekeeping this game and saying how ""newbies don't deserve to play this game because it's easier?"" I'm still asking that question because honestly that's what I was expecting to happen when this game was announced. I have yet to see anything like that. Instead I found a welcoming and helpful community both in and out of Eldo Ringins, all with a wealth of knowledge and a willingness to help those who are new to the game learn and grow. Honestly I was and still am surprised.Bottom line, if you want to actually give Soulsbornes a try, I couldn't recommend The Eldern Rings V: Skyrune more. It's well worth the AAA price tag and I can see Runescape being one of the few titles that can and will stand the test of time.",elden ring learn stop hate soulsborn prais dog ill complet honest ive never best relationship fromsoftwar yeah game aesthet pleas honestli gameplay wasnt realli thing hard theyr punish sure understood game work everyth quit easi ultim fandom time consist snob threw around git gud without actual offer advic mostli singleplay experi turn away sort gamesthen friend gift copi game thank btw know aremi expect low that blew mind game first place eld ring honestli felt like huge improv soulsborn titl eldward ringscorhand hard oh yeah doubt longer stuck area spend hour grind enemi couldnt overcom boss could level hop hors explor part map never found littl adventur come back feel like im readi take whatev progress stori mechan present sinc demon soul didnt feel like use pool noodl comparison whatev weapon use dark soul breath wild feel flexibl comparison predecessor come want play want doand probabl time address someth ive ask sweatlord dark soul veteran gatekeep game say newbi dont deserv play game easier im still ask question honestli that expect happen game announc yet see anyth like instead found welcom help commun eldo ringin wealth knowledg willing help new game learn grow honestli still surprisedbottom line want actual give soulsborn tri couldnt recommend eldern ring v skyrun well worth aaa price tag see runescap one titl stand test time

"Very interesting game, also very flawed.Positives:No pay to winGreat art directionSolid storyOpen world stuffAbility to share base with friendsBuild varietyNegatives:Building system that will make even grown men cryLackluster PVEAwful PVP (multiple contributing factors)DesyncServer performanceClient authoritative""Did you hear that?""I spent over 500 hours across multiple accounts and servers, 160 hours on a PVE server to find out that the PVE server exclusive content, ""Prime War"" is utterly disappointing boss fight where players roll up, place rocket launcher turret, shoot a boss with some explosives, shoot a boss with some weapons and disperse.Moving on to a PVP server with multiple accounts to minimize unlucky RNG, the PVP is badly structured.While open world PVP is possible, it relies on both parties opting in to PVP status every 5-10 minutes as it automatically turns off, with no incentive to turn on PVP.Other then cargo event which is present on both PVP and PVE servers, the only meaningful PVP is territory battles, which is completely broken and barely even playable. If you happen to be able to even get in in the first place (because bugs), you need to build a defensive structure to protect your terminal, while the enemy clan and anyone else can destroy your building and kill you as you build.When the battle officially starts, you cannot build and the enemy can just drive their vehicles thru your structure (before it loads on their device) and destroy it from the inside with no counterplay, this isn't a bug btw. it's just how the game is coded. They can also shoot and kill you thru your defensive structures as long as their internet/PC is slow enough not to load these structures.In all this, there is never an incentive to actually fight, just hold W and throw boom at structure until the territory terminal dies.Oh and did I mention that after respawning the enemy cars are invisible for long enough to drive up to or inside your fort?This game had a lot of promise, but it was terribly fumbled, especially after playing Undawn (their previous game) which had both PVE and PVP content many times better, I'd even say the PVE was amazing for what it was, unfortunately that one was p2w and the game died as soon as that created large enough power gap.",interest game also flawedpositivesno pay wingreat art directionsolid storyopen world stuffabl share base friendsbuild varietynegativesbuild system make even grown men crylacklust pveaw pvp multipl contribut factorsdesyncserv performancecli authoritativedid hear thati spent hour across multipl account server hour pve server find pve server exclus content prime war utterli disappoint boss fight player roll place rocket launcher turret shoot boss explos shoot boss weapon dispersemov pvp server multipl account minim unlucki rng pvp badli structuredwhil open world pvp possibl reli parti opt pvp statu everi minut automat turn incent turn pvpother cargo event present pvp pve server meaning pvp territori battl complet broken bare even playabl happen abl even get first place bug need build defens structur protect termin enemi clan anyon els destroy build kill buildwhen battl offici start build enemi drive vehicl thru structur load devic destroy insid counterplay isnt bug btw game code also shoot kill thru defens structur long internetpc slow enough load structuresin never incent actual fight hold w throw boom structur territori termin diesoh mention respawn enemi car invis long enough drive insid fortthi game lot promis terribl fumbl especi play undawn previou game pve pvp content mani time better id even say pve amaz unfortun one game die soon creat larg enough power gap

"Black Myth: Wukong------------------------------------------------Been a fan of Journey to the West since I read it, so I was excited to dive into Black Myth: WuKong.First off, let me say, this game looks fantastic. The environments are absolutely stunning, with some of the best level design I've seen in a long time. It captures the mythical Chinese landscapes beautifully, and every area feels meticulously crafted. Some of the scenery just had me stopping in my tracks. The game's design is just on another level.The soundtrack? Pure gold. It fits the world and the mythical vibe perfectly. Each track seems to amplify the experience, making the boss fights more intense and the exploration more immersive.But the gameplay... that's where things get a bit tricky. The combat is fun, but it can feel a bit floaty at times. There's impact, but something feels off. It's not as tight as you'd want, which leaves the experience less satisfying during some of the tougher battles. Speaking of battles, there are a lot of bosses. Some of them are absolute highlights, with incredible design and challenge, but others? They kind of miss the mark and feel a bit repetitive.The story is another area that might trip people up. It draws heavily from Journey to the West, which, for me, was great because I've read it. But I can imagine that for those unfamiliar with the book, it can feel confusing and disjointed at times. There are moments that seem to assume you already know some of the lore, which might leave others scratching their heads. Thankfully, knowing the story helped me keep track of what was happening, but I can see how others might struggle with it.Overall, Black Myth: Wu Kong is a visual masterpiece with a great soundtrack and brilliant level design. But it stumbles a bit when it comes to gameplay, and the story could be clearer for those who haven't read the source material. Still, if you're a fan of the mythos like I am, there's plenty to love here.So, get ready to journey with the monkey – just know that not everything's as polished as it looks!enjoy WUKONG !!!",black myth wukongbeen fan journey west sinc read excit dive black myth wukongfirst let say game look fantast environ absolut stun best level design ive seen long time captur mythic chines landscap beauti everi area feel meticul craft sceneri stop track game design anoth levelth soundtrack pure gold fit world mythic vibe perfectli track seem amplifi experi make boss fight intens explor immersivebut gameplay that thing get bit tricki combat fun feel bit floati time there impact someth feel tight youd want leav experi less satisfi tougher battl speak battl lot boss absolut highlight incred design challeng other kind miss mark feel bit repetitiveth stori anoth area might trip peopl draw heavili journey west great ive read imagin unfamiliar book feel confus disjoint time moment seem assum alreadi know lore might leav other scratch head thank know stori help keep track happen see other might struggl itoveral black myth wu kong visual masterpiec great soundtrack brilliant level design stumbl bit come gameplay stori could clearer havent read sourc materi still your fan mytho like there plenti love hereso get readi journey monkey know everyth polish looksenjoy wukong

"GOTY, EMBRACE MONKEY 🐒 This game became one of my favourites of all time, I'm so happy it's getting the appreciation it deserves and peaked 2.2 million players. It's truly unique, ignore whatever these journalists are saying about the game's diversity because its shown that no one cares. The game is based on a Chinese Fantasy Novel, 1592 'Journey To The West', 'diversity' shouldn't matter. These people are so brainrot.But to talk about the actual game, it's a masterpiece to say the least. The bosses are so fun and unique, all have such cool animations and special designs. The cutscenes and intros to the bosses are phenomenal. The skills and mechanics in this game are so amazing and haven't seen in other games before. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous, everything in this game is literally just unique, no other words to explain. The genre is a mix between a few, I'd say action, souls-like and RPG. Personally I haven't had any performance issues and I would say this is really well optimized.Game Science really outdid themselves on their first big game like this, and if this is how their first game is then I can't wait to see what they have in store for us in the future.

"2022 Elden Ring isn’t perfect.Comparing this game to other FromSoftware products one aspect after another it’s clear that Elden Ring isn’t as smooth as Sekiro, doesn’t have bosses like Dark Souls, and its story isn’t as good as Bloodborne, but looking this way at anything will make no sense, you simply do not order salad in Subway and then put one star review saying that they refused to sell you a salad.Elden Rings lore and story.Game’s still fresh, Vaatividya still works on lore, and so far we barely can piece together coherent explanation to what happened before we set foot in Lands Between. It offers some similarities to ideas that Dark Souls used before, and it’s open for speculations as much.As for the story of the game, we’re thrown in fractured world only hundred years after The Shattering, war that no demigod came out victorious leaving Lands Between in stalemate. We’re tarnished, once stripped from the grace of Greater Will and exiled, coming back to Lands Between, resurrected and yet again guided by the very grace we were stripped from, with one goal – to become the Elden Lord.World of Elden Ring.To summarize how big Lands Between are I will say only this: there’s always more.Elden Ring world is made up from five main parts on surface level, this already sounds like enormous place. But wait, there’s more – each part has legacy dungeons, big structures that player can get lost for hours and still be surprised revisiting the place. There are also catacombs, minor erdtrees, ruins, villages, and so on. It is very densely packed and it gives hours upon hours of additional content to go through. Still not enough? There is literally 3 major underground locations, each bigger than the last one. And for the dessert - whole legacy dungeon floating above the sea near the coastline of Lands Between.It is big, but is it pleasant to look at??To answer that we can go back and look at last two games made by FromSoftware, Sekiro and Dark Souls 3, and precisely Fountainhead Palace and Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. FromSoftware seems to like dragging players through countless swamps and catacombs, difficult bosses, and whatnot to build up the hatred towards another location that we might need to go through to finish the game, and then every negative emotion leaves the body, because we’re presented with what’s called ‘the best area in the game aesthetically’, that’s the case with Irithyll, that’s the case with Fountainhead palace, and that’s the case with… nearly every legacy dungeon in Elden Ring. Progressing through the world of this game is like going the best location in one souls game to another best location from different game. I think there also is beauty in elevation, and Elden Ring does exceptional job at that too. Lands Between are not flat, they’re constantly changing elevation as we progress through the game, but not only between main parts of the map, also between locations in those parts. FromSoftware creates dark fantasy and I, personally, think that currently there’s no one in the industry better at doing so.Gameplay of Elden Ring.The most important part for some, especially if advertised as ACTION RPG. Just a reminder, you’re Tarnished, a nobody with a simple task to become the Elden Lord, against various demigods, with a stick and wooden shield. The game is not easy. It is not the hardest FromSoftware game, but it’s still hard, especially for newcomers.What to expect? Dying, a lot. Elden Ring, like any From game has no difficulty slider, there’s one difficulty – Get Gud. Fortunately for Tarnished, Elden Ring provides a lot of different mechanics to ease the pain such as: magic, summons, broken status buildup (bleed, cold), co-op, cheesing, and last, but not least (for PC) – modding. There already are mods to change the difficulty by lowering health and attack damage of nearly everything in Elden Ring. To experience the game the best way though is to go through it yourself, learn to fight, optimize your build and try again, because there’s no better feeling in FromSoftware games than beating hard boss yourself.Will you get bored? I don’t think there’s a chance to get bored in this game, even with such simple combat mechanics, because there’s also variety of builds, with easily over 200, probably even more weapons, over 100 armor sets for your fresh Elden Bling, and many more configurations with new addition – Ashes of War. If that’s not enough, let’s talk about variety of enemies. Remember seeing total of 19 enemies in God of War from 2018, winner of Game of the Year? There’s over 140 unique enemy types in the game that are vastly different from each other (except for reskins, not many of them though). Also, rats are back, now with madness status to make your life even more miserable. There’s actually a lot of enemies that you will hate with passion, you will go on reddit and vent about it, and you will see that vast majority of players also hate them.I am Malenia, Blade of Ashina, and hasitation is defeat.TLDR : The game is the only rightful choice for Game of the Year.",elden ring isnt perfectcompar game fromsoftwar product one aspect anoth clear elden ring isnt smooth sekiro doesnt boss like dark soul stori isnt good bloodborn look way anyth make sens simpli order salad subway put one star review say refus sell saladelden ring lore storygam still fresh vaatividya still work lore far bare piec togeth coher explan happen set foot land offer similar idea dark soul use open specul mucha stori game thrown fractur world hundr year shatter war demigod came victori leav land stalem tarnish strip grace greater exil come back land resurrect yet guid grace strip one goal becom elden lordworld elden ringto summar big land say there alway moreelden ring world made five main part surfac level alreadi sound like enorm place wait there part legaci dungeon big structur player get lost hour still surpris revisit place also catacomb minor erdtre ruin villag dens pack give hour upon hour addit content go still enough liter major underground locat bigger last one dessert whole legaci dungeon float sea near coastlin land betweenit big pleasant look atto answer go back look last two game made fromsoftwar sekiro dark soul precis fountainhead palac irithyl boreal valley fromsoftwar seem like drag player countless swamp catacomb difficult boss whatnot build hatr toward anoth locat might need go finish game everi neg emot leav bodi present what call best area game aesthet that case irithyl that case fountainhead palac that case nearli everi legaci dungeon elden ring progress world game like go best locat one soul game anoth best locat differ game think also beauti elev elden ring except job land flat theyr constantli chang elev progress game main part map also locat part fromsoftwar creat dark fantasi person think current there one industri better sogameplay elden ringth import part especi advertis action rpg remind your tarnish nobodi simpl task becom elden lord variou demigod stick wooden shield game easi hardest fromsoftwar game still hard especi newcomerswhat expect die lot elden ring like game difficulti slider there one difficulti get gud fortun tarnish elden ring provid lot differ mechan eas pain magic summon broken statu buildup bleed cold coop chees last least pc mod alreadi mod chang difficulti lower health attack damag nearli everyth elden ring experi game best way though go learn fight optim build tri there better feel fromsoftwar game beat hard boss yourselfwil get bore dont think there chanc get bore game even simpl combat mechan there also varieti build easili probabl even weapon armor set fresh elden bling mani configur new addit ash war that enough let talk varieti enemi rememb see total enemi god war winner game year there uniqu enemi type game vastli differ except reskin mani though also rat back mad statu make life even miser there actual lot enemi hate passion go reddit vent see vast major player also hate themi malenia blade ashina hasit defeattldr game right choic game year

"2022 pros:1. good exploration2. spells and miracles in this game looks awesome nglcons:The boss fight sucks. so many 1 shot moves. that's not a good design, that's lazy and cheap. no, you cant tell me to ""git gud"" when you have 30ish vigors and the boss still 1 shot you.From the previous fromsoft game that i played (ds3 and sekiro): Slave knight gael, the twin princes, isshin, owl, and many more. that's great bosses.also at the end of the day, what you want is satisfaction after you defeat the bosses. i dont feel anything when i beat bosses in this gameupdated: i played more until i beat the infamous malenia. and holy ♥♥♥♥. a boss who moves that fast does not belong to a souls game. it's like you face a sekiro boss while you move like a normal souls character.also.Failed attempt at dual bosses (yes, i'm looking at you, godskin duo) for reference, demon prince, smough&ornstein, headless ape. that's how you do a good dual bosses, while 1 boss is aggressive, the other one still attacks you, but at a slower pace. meanwhile dual bosses in this game is.. both of the bosses attacking you aggressively at the same time. yes it's harder. but is it fair? no.my overall review still standsoverall: 6.5/10",good spell miracl game look awesom nglconsth boss fight suck mani shot move that good design that lazi cheap cant tell git gud vigor boss still shot youfrom previou fromsoft game play sekiro slave knight gael twin princ isshin owl mani that great bossesalso end day want satisfact defeat boss dont feel anyth beat boss gameupd play beat infam malenia holi boss move fast belong soul game like face sekiro boss move like normal soul characteralsofail attempt dual boss ye im look godskin duo refer demon princ smoughornstein headless ape that good dual boss boss aggress one still attack slower pace meanwhil dual boss game boss attack aggress time ye harder fair nomi overal review still standsoveral

However 12hrs in so far, I enjoyed the game so much.It offers beautify graphics, amazing audio, story is after the timeline of Journey to the west so may be a bit hard to follow for some. Not an issue for me since I have good knowledge around Journey to the west.Boss fights are epic and challenging but not feeling impossible.

"2023 Switching this to a positive for now. CA have made big strides in bug fixing and the amount of content they put in DLCs. Thrones of Decay is night and day compared to Shadows of change with a ton of free content on the side. Bugs that have been around for years - e.g. pursuing routing units being wonky, range LoS not working, artillery not spreading shots etc - have been fixed. The price point of the DLC is still quite high but its no longer applied to a broken game and what you get is excellent.Old negative review below.---I loved this trilogy - well over 1k hours between the 3 games, but CA have burnt all goodwill in 2 ways:1) Glacial pace and low quality of patching. Very basic features which have been reported multiple times over years have been left unaddressed and ignored. Community bugfixes which changed one line of code have fixed some of these problems, but CA have done nothing.2) Lord pack pricing moving from £7.99 - > £19.99 for a similar amount of content is bananas. There is no justifiable reason for this level of price hike, especially considering the poor support WH3 has received in its lifecycle. And this is from someone who happily paid for the increased price of the Chaos Dwarfs.If these two problems get addressed it can possibly move to a thumbs up, but right now, this is unacceptable.",switch posit ca made big stride bug fix amount content put dlc throne decay night day compar shadow chang ton free content side bug around year eg pursu rout unit wonki rang lo work artilleri spread shot etc fix price point dlc still quit high longer appli broken game get excellentold neg review belowi love trilog well hour game ca burnt goodwil glacial pace low qualiti patch basic featur report multipl time year left unaddress ignor commun bugfix chang one line code fix problem ca done lord pack price move similar amount content banana justifi reason level price hike especi consid poor support receiv lifecycl someon happili paid increas price chao dwarfsif two problem get address possibl move thumb right unaccept

"2022 This is the third game in a trilogy of games. They didn't have to create a new game engine, they didn't have to improve graphics in a major way, they didnt have to deal with creating entirely brand new game mechanics. All they had to do was take what they learned from the previous two games and create new content for a pre-exisitng game engine. Somehow, after 5 years of development, they managed to thoroughly ♥♥♥♥ that up.What's a further disgrace is that only 3 months after release Total War Warhammer 2 has on average 3000 more concurrent players than this game.

"2023 Edit: My original edit didn't save so here's a TLDR - Thrones of Decay and 5.0 have released and CA have proved that they can release good DLCs still. Is it worth it? I would say yes. Is the price still too high overall? I would also say yes.Nurgle, Empire, and Dwarfs got the reworks that they needed and new fun units/lords and mechanics. This is what DLCs and the big X.0 patches should bring. Hopefully this is a new start for CA and Warhammer 3. The original SoC review will stay just so that what they did won't be forgotten and that we should hold CA to a higher standard than whatever launch SoC was.First off, I love this series both Warhammer and the Total War series in general. I've been playing back in Rome 1 where I borrowed the discs (crazy I know) from a friend and fell in love with the series. I then followed it up to Warhammer 1. Didn't know anything about the world of Warhammer Fantasy and now I like it more than 40K in many aspects. But for the real reason for this review. Actually the only review at the time of writing that I've written on steam.Total War: Warhammer 3 also known as Total Warhammer 3, is a game that I want to suggest to everyone. But CA you're making it really hard... For every step up the stairs you make it seems that you follow it up by falling down the flight you just made it up. This game is in a very rough state and needs the proper care that a mainline series should get. We know that this is your golden goose. But it seems that you're treating it like a middle step-child that isn't amounting to anything.The game needs help. Not just in the content feed. The game itself, Immortal Empires (IE) since not a lot of people care for Realms of Chaos, is in such a terrible state that needs a community patch to even be playable in some instances. Some of these gameplay bugs (or maybe we should be calling them features?) are:-Nakai not being able to recruit Kroxigors AT ALL (this is a paid DLC Lord from Warhammer 2).-It's impossible for the Champions of Chaos lords (also paid DLC) to upgrade Daemons to Exalted Daemons-Way too many units from almost all factions don't get the benefits from the red line buffs even though it's stated that they do-Norsca's Monster Hunts are still bugged-Gunpowder units don't fire, say it's obstructed, or just run right into the enemy even though line of sight is perfectly clearAnd there are many, many, MANY more bugs. If you ever wanted to see how many were fixed by the community so that they can continue to play the game that they love go and see the big community bug fix mod here on the workshop. Though if you're still playing then you most likely have this installed anyways. BuT tHeY'rE FiXeD wItH tHe MoD, wHy CoMpLaIn? Because Straw-man, CA shouldn't let these fester and get this bad. They should be putting resources into this game that's making them the money they need and from the recent DLC pricing, so desperately want.And the DLC pricing.... 25 bucks (USD)? Really? For 3 Lords for 3 different factions and a small amount of units split between those 3 factions? You, CA, think that Shadows of Change is really on the same level as the Chaos Dwarfs? And even that was overly priced for a race pack... Here's the old break down:WH2 Lord Pack:2 Lords (1 for each faction for the DLC) with new or reworked mechanicsRoughly 4-6 new units AND a new generic lord type PER FACTIONNew Regiments of Renown units ranging from ~4-8 PER FACTIONAnd maybe a FLC Lord that might have some unique way of playing or a legendary hero.All for 10 bucks (usd)WH2 Race Pack:4 Legendary Lords2 or more generic lord types with their own set of magicsCompletely new faction with unique mechanics and unit rosters built from the ground upAll for roughly 18 bucks (usd)Shadows of Change:3 Legendary Lords (one for Kislev, Cathay, and Tzeentch)9 units (3 for Kislev, 3 for Tzeentch, and 3 for Cathay - 4 if you push it.)1 Legendary Hero for Tzeentch1 Generic Hero for Kislev1 Generic Lord for Cathayand 9 ROR units (3 for Kislev, 3 for Tzeentch, and 3 for Cathay)All for 25 BUCKS (usd). REALLY?There's is no need for the 150% price increase for this one lord pack. The Champions of Chaos DLC was 16 bucks and that came with FOUR Legendary Lords and a TON of new units. Yes most of them were reskins of each other but that's fine since the units themselves are just different flavors of chaos. I'm sure most people would've been able to stomach $16 even though we really aught to be getting more than what's offered in Shadows of Change for even $16.But all this to say: CA you can be better. I and I'm sure the many, MANY people that play your games want you to be better. Now I won't say stop shoveling money into Hyenas (even though your fanbase probably won't care about the game) but please...

"2023 I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",yo father probabl one oldest peopl play game singl father son son got game christma uncl instal comput start play end week hour game horribl alreadi hard find way spend time son alway friend watch youtub decid make steam account get game see could mayb play alongsid load game pick charact world start play stuck suppos ask son help host game join love best time spent son sinc wife die game ever sinc brought son closer actual spend time togeth outsid hous togeth well game remind there fun everyth brought son mani happi memori

"TL:DR rating -> Epic/10I rarely get the urge to platinum a game, but after what the devs gave us for the secret boss fight, it became a game worthy for the 100%.Detailed Review:-So Wukong chapter 1 starts off with a fairly linear map and straight forward fun bosses and you get the impression that its 7.5/10 or 8/10 game.Then chapter 2 starts and it opens up. And then chapter 3 is just massive and the ante just keeps picking up from there till the end.As someone who has played the souls games a lot, I didn't face any issues with any of the bosses in terms of difficulty(Only 2 secret/optional bosses are a good challenge). Wukong's focus is mainly on level design, storybuilding/lore, enemy design and variety. And it exceeds expectations in all these departments.Pros:-1.)Every chapter ends with an animated short clip. These clips are astonishingly well made and deserves special plaudits.2.)Enemy variety and Design - There's so many enemies and bosses in this game and none of them are really copy paste bosses(except the frogs but even they have different elemental effects).3.)Storytelling based on existing lore. This is spectacularly done. The quest design is also quite fun. If you are exploring well, its very hard to miss questlines.4.)Level Design - Chapter 1 and 5 are fairly straightforward and linear. Chapter 2,3 and 4 have massive sprawling interconnected multi-layered levels. Very fun to explore. Chapter 6 is basically a big circle with bosses spread around the map.5.)There are 2 secret optional bosses who are a good level of challenge. One of these fights is extremely special and is easily the most fun I have had in years. Jawdropping spectacle.Cons:-1.) To get platinum, NG+ run is a must as some weapons only unlock in NG+ and the components to craft 2 pieces of an armor are also only available in NG+. But that is still fine since you can speedrun NG+ which takes a few hours. The most annoying thing is to obtain certain items you need to either get lucky, or farm a single enemy for hours. I had to waste nearly 3 hours killing the same enemies to get -> thunderflame seal curio and tiger tendon belt curio. I don't know what the drop rate is for these items but its terrible. This is a shame and a practice game companies should lean away from. It sucks the fun out of things having to mindlessly run a loop killing enemies hoping to get an item drop.2.) Some areas of the map look like they can be easily dropped down to and explored but there are some invisible walls. That is kind of immersion breaking.'3.) Technical issues for a lot of people with texture popins, lighting imbalance etc. I got lucky to not get any major technical issues. I did face some lighting glitches in 1 or 2 areas.4.) English voice acting is ass. Especially for sun wukong. Thankfully, your character ddoesn't speak at all during the game. The only part where wukong speaks is during the intro and the end of chapter cutscenes. The chinese voice acting on the other hand, sounds exceptionally good but then again, that is to be expected.That's about all the major issues I had with the game tbh. Very fun game overall. And especially coming from a studio with their first major release, Game Science have done a spectacular job. Hopefully more to come from them with this same level of quality.",tldr rate rare get urg platinum game dev gave us secret boss fight becam game worthi reviewso wukong chapter start fairli linear map straight forward fun boss get impress gamethen chapter start open chapter massiv ant keep pick till enda someon play soul game lot didnt face issu boss term difficultyonli secretopt boss good challeng wukong focu mainli level design storybuildinglor enemi design varieti exce expect chapter end anim short clip clip astonishingli well made deserv special varieti design there mani enemi boss game none realli copi past bossesexcept frog even differ element base exist lore spectacularli done quest design also quit fun explor well hard miss design chapter fairli straightforward linear chapter massiv sprawl interconnect multilay level fun explor chapter basic big circl boss spread around secret option boss good level challeng one fight extrem special easili fun year jawdrop get platinum ng run must weapon unlock ng compon craft piec armor also avail ng still fine sinc speedrun ng take hour annoy thing obtain certain item need either get lucki farm singl enemi hour wast nearli hour kill enemi get thunderflam seal curio tiger tendon belt curio dont know drop rate item terribl shame practic game compani lean away suck fun thing mindlessli run loop kill enemi hope get item area map look like easili drop explor invis wall kind immers technic issu lot peopl textur popin light imbal etc got lucki get major technic issu face light glitch english voic act ass especi sun wukong thank charact ddoesnt speak game part wukong speak intro end chapter cutscen chines voic act hand sound except good expectedthat major issu game tbh fun game overal especi come studio first major releas game scienc done spectacular job hope come level qualiti
"2023 Terrible business practices in general by Creative Assembly + SEGA. Above average game marred by terrible monetization and DLC model. Not worth it if you plan to actually buy the DLC.

To add insult to injury, they also upped prices for their DLC and quality + quantity of content just keeps going down.Never-ending greed, awful monetization, and a developer/publisher pair that could not care less about the actual quality of the game or player feedback...

"I was on the fence about whether to recommend this game or not before I realized that if I need to think about it, then I can’t recommend it. Still, Black Myth: Wukong is about as close to getting a recommendation as a game that I don’t recommend can be, if that’s worth anything. If you can snag this on sale for $30 or $40, it’s worth that price. It’s also important to support games like this and Stellar Blade that show that countries not known for producing solid single-player games can do just that. But there is a limit to what that leeway will allow. Wukong is so close to being such a solid game. Sadly, as I continued playing, I was having less and less fun with it. Maybe my expectations were too high for a developer’s first “real” video game. Maybe I should have expected some of the jank and some of the issues in the game. Then again, for a $60 game that presents itself as being on the same level as other AAA titles, maybe it isn’t completely unfair that my expectations were as high as they were for Wukong. The game starts strong with Wukong talking insane amounts of trash to a literally massive Celestial Court. I was all for that. I was ready to be on board with this character. I was ready for a story where he could grow from this brash character across a long journey. Wukong in the intro was so enjoyable that it was a punch in the mouth when we got stuck with a mute monkey that has no personality, character, or charm. Looking back on it, I think the Destined One was probably meant to be a character you project yourself onto. That’s all fine and good, but sadly, I wasn’t a monkey swinging around a staff the last time I checked, so that fell a little flat. That start put me in a disappointed mindset. I can’t help but feel like it would have been better to include that glorified cutscene toward the end of the game instead of leaving the player with a jarring character shift right at the start of the story. In fact, a lot of the other characters are fun to watch, which makes the Destined One’s complete lack of character even more annoying to deal with as the story progresses. I get that writing a character to be the focal point of a long story can be hard, but come on, this was based on one of the most iconic pieces of Chinese literature in the world. Something more than a mute monkey could have been done here. In fact, despite being based on one of the most iconic pieces of Chinese literature ever, the story isn’t up to much at all. I will concede that this might be because I’m entirely unfamiliar with Journey to the West, but I think I can be forgiven for expecting a standalone game to tell a story. The second, third, or fourth game in a series? Sure, it’s on me for not knowing what’s going on. I’m not putting not having a firm grip on the narrative on me in this instance, not when the story dumps come in the form of “music videos” before dropping me in the middle of a brand-new area and biome. Mighty nice-looking biomes, mind you. Granted, they’re the kind of nice-looking that’s better for pretty screenshots instead of practical and intuitive level design. After Chapter 1, the areas are just too big. I felt like I was spending most of my time running around, trying to hunt for secrets since I wanted to get as much out of the game as possible, and that became annoying. Granted, I appreciate a developer who puts huge areas and missable secrets in games that are both cool and help with the future critical path stuff. It makes it worth the player’s time and effort to engage with side content, and in the world of bloated games like Assassin’s Creed and Star Wars Outlaws, having side content that’s worth engaging with is a huge plus. Still, the level design became almost unbearable in Chapter 6 when I was trying to spot small, interesting-looking areas while flying around on a cloud that looked so bad it belonged in an N64 game. I know you made very pretty environments. They are very pretty indeed. Please, when you make the inevitable sequel to this game, trim the fat down, make the areas smaller, add better indicators for what’s a pile of rubble that’s worth climbing on and what isn’t, and let people focus on the best part of your game: the combat. The combat, while the best part of the game—particularly against the visually impressive bosses—still has its own set of baggage. There’s a robust set of skill trees, and while there aren’t really “builds” in Wukong, there are plenty of options to shake up your play style. There are probably too many skill tree options, but unlike Path of Exile, looking at Wukong’s skill trees doesn’t make me want to puke. Low bar to clear but clear it Wukong did. The biggest issue with the combat is that it just doesn’t work half the time. I have no idea how they worked on this game for so long, hanging their hat on the combat, and somehow aerial heavy attacks just don’t connect. It was insane how many times I would walk up to a stationary enemy, jump in the air, and use my heavy attack, just for my hit to not connect. This game spent 6 years in development. I should not have issues hitting an aerial heavy attack because the game decided to take a nap on the job. Enemy hitboxes and hurtboxes in general aren’t very good. Too many attacks would miss because an enemy bigger than my apartment wiggled an inch to the left. Of course, that rule doesn’t apply to you. In the interest of fairness, the Destined One decided to expand his hurtbox to twice his normal size on either side of him. The only exception to this is when you’re in your Rock Solid—the game’s parry—form. Then enemy attacks will often conveniently miss you until you’re out of your Rock Solid form. Rock Solid is one of the first spells that just won't work half the time. There’s a bug where you can use your Immobilize spell on a boss, but it won’t work, and the boss will hit you anyway and out your spell on cooldown. I’m giving the developers the benefit of the doubt by saying this is a bug, because if it’s intentional game design to have the immobilize spell not immobilize when used, then it’s inexcusable. Even when the spells do work, there’s a chunk of bosses that just don’t let you use them. You’ll use Immobilize, and what is essentially plot armor kicks in, and they say you don’t get to use that spell. Nope, it doesn’t matter how many points you invested into that spell. You don’t get to use it on the boss because the game says you can’t. On top of that, some of the boss fights are horrendously designed and were the tipping points into making me realize the game just wasn’t as fun as it had been. Despite the game itself getting easier as it went on thanks to the upgrades, the devs made sure to study up on Manus, Father of the Abyss, to make sure they got their spastic flailing down just right. At least the worst single attack most bosses have in their arsenals is the lost mystical art of a random 20 FPS drop.Yellow Loong and Erlang are two boss fights that are exceptionally bad, making sure they stocked up on their Elden Ring 18-hit, flailing combos along with plenty of poise (a trait shared with normal enemies, for some reason) to ensure they got to be as annoying as possible. When they decide you’ve had too much fun and got to play the game too much, they make sure to take to the air for a few years, letting you contemplate your sins of winning too hard. You know what? Perhaps that’s in line with the game’s themes. Disappointingly, Wukong is a game of numerous small irritations that surround the core of something that could be so much better.

"2022 Review Grade Comments Gameplay ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ The combat is amazing (as expected from FromSoft's souls-like games), most of the times you will see the ""You are Dead"" screen, but never let that stop you from trying again. The challenges in the game will require you to use your intellect, reaction time, and quick decision making. Building your Character's stats and optimizing it for your chosen play-style is a factor, but how you handle combat takes a lot of mastery and is much more important. Story (No Spoilers) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ The story and the lore is great, there are many Characters that have rich backstories and carefully crafted backgrounds that will make sense the longer you play and finish the story (even when you make another playthrough). Playtime Length ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ How long you finish the game depends on how you mastered your play-style and your enemies, give it 60+ hours just to complete the story and a total of 150+ hours if you want to get the game to 100% completion (full achievements). My Recommendation A must have Souls-like game! It is a great buy if you want to play a souls-like game! If you are a new player wanting to try Souls-like games, then I recommend you buy Elden Ring!",review grade comment gameplay combat amaz expect fromsoft soulslik game time see dead screen never let stop tri challeng game requir use intellect reaction time quick decis make build charact stat optim chosen playstyl factor handl combat take lot masteri much import stori spoiler stori lore great mani charact rich backstori care craft background make sens longer play finish stori even make anoth playthrough playtim length long finish game depend master playstyl enemi give hour complet stori total hour want get game complet full achiev recommend must soulslik game great buy want play soulslik game new player want tri soulslik game recommend buy elden ring

"2015 Gotta say dissapointing game. Totally boring, unplayable with random people, and it takes someone with tons of patience to play. The action is very limited, and it requires a lot of boring camping to accompish anything. You'd need to have friends and nothing better to do to make this game even bearable. Not worth the money.",got ta say dissapoint game total bore unplay random peopl take someon ton patienc play action limit requir lot bore camp accompish anyth youd need friend noth better make game even bearabl worth money
"It's an excellent game. The campaign has non stop moments of epic and memorable scenes that are packed so densely with laconian style blunt conversations and phrases that you can smell the sweat through the screen as your character regains his faith in brotherhood. There wasn't a moment where I was bored and thought to myself that the game was being padded out, I just had fun all the way through the campaign. This all is enhanced by the badass combat, where it looks like you're effortlessly cutting down the craziest monsters in rapid succession if you're playing well, while getting your face kicked in if you don't. Parrying, doging, gunstriking, armor and your melee movesets provides so much avenue to swing your big ♥♥♥♥ around, without it feeling like you're getting everything for free, because even a few little enemies can destroy you if you go afk. You're basically forced to regain health through hits, then line up gunstrikes or executions to regain armor, which protects your health against ranged. It feels so good to do because EVERYTHING can be parried and stomped into the ground, you're like a tank inching forward through the masses of enemies, without it feeling too easy. It's like Sekiro or Elden Ring, you can parry/deflect everyone's moveset with a very generous window if you make the right choices. I hope they DON'T add health regain on executions because it would make the game feel like ♥♥♥♥, because then you turn into a brain dead execution drone who doesn't even understand gunstrikes, which ruins the skill ceiling and what makes this gameplay feel so good.Operations is a PvE Coop mode alá Darktide that adds a whole bunch of RPG mechanics as you play through missions from the view point of another squad. You get a dozen classes to level up with, with passive skill trees, a lot of weapon variants that don't even exist in the campaign, getting full access to customize your armor and even having skill trees on weapons. These skill trees have just enough impact to make you feel like a god once you're progressing through them (ie. regenerating health on kill perks). It provides enough complexity and enjoyment that it feels like a fresh experience right after the campaign, which doesn't have much RPG elements at all.Seriously though, the skill ceiling of the gameplay is so rewarding that this could easily be a not recommeded if they make it easier.",excel game campaign non stop moment epic memor scene pack dens laconian style blunt convers phrase smell sweat screen charact regain faith brotherhood wasnt moment bore thought game pad fun way campaign enhanc badass combat look like your effortlessli cut craziest monster rapid success your play well get face kick dont parri doge gunstrik armor mele moveset provid much avenu swing big around without feel like your get everyth free even littl enemi destroy go afk your basic forc regain health hit line gunstrik execut regain armor protect health rang feel good everyth parri stomp ground your like tank inch forward mass enemi without feel easi like sekiro elden ring parrydeflect everyon moveset gener window make right choic hope dont add health regain execut would make game feel like turn brain dead execut drone doesnt even understand gunstrik ruin skill ceil make gameplay feel goodoper pve coop mode al darktid add whole bunch rpg mechan play mission view point anoth squad get dozen class level passiv skill tree lot weapon variant dont even exist campaign get full access custom armor even skill tree weapon skill tree enough impact make feel like god your progress ie regener health kill perk provid enough complex enjoy feel like fresh experi right campaign doesnt much rpg element allseri though skill ceil gameplay reward could easili recommed make easier

"The most enjoyable game I've played in a long time. It remains true to the story of the Warhammer universe. I think it might be the only game today that hasn't been touched by the Woke nonsense. There is no giant power-armoured killing machine gay space marines f***** each other around. That's why it's being attacked on the internet. I think there needs to be more support for such productions today. Let's come to the gameplay:Combat mechanics are very good and very enjoyable, especially fighting against large hordes is very fun. The storytelling is very good and I think the campaign duration is quite sufficient. PvE PvP modes are enjoyable, the operation mode was the part I liked the most.I have a ryzen 5700x and 6800xt graphics card, but at 1440p normal settings, it can often fall below 60 fps and puts a lot of load on the processor. I'm not sure, but I think it's a game that depends more on the processor. Other than that, it's a very fun game. It is very fun to play the campaign mode with your three friends.

Not only did the developer release the game as free to play, but not pay to win, they released a finished product and not something in the alpha stages of development. They have been quick to address any server issues at launch, and have repeatedly added balance and quality of life patches without breaking other aspects of the game.

"The campaign is short, but it was some of the most satisfying gaming I have ever experienced. I've been a gamer for around 40 years. I love the Warhammer 40K universe and eveything was well done and true to the 40K lore. The music, sound effects, visuals, and even colors are all done well. Missions are intense at times and visceral, The final mission was the most cinematic moment I have seen in a game since Mass Effect 3 and I think this topped it. The PVE is fine for those who want to keep playing and grinding for gear. The PVE is a lot of fun as well. It was money well spent. It was a wonderful change of pace from Helldivers. Unlike Helldivers, there are no bugs at all. Everything seems polished. None of the weapons seem or feel underpowered.",campaign short satisfi game ever experienc ive gamer around year love warhamm univers eveyth well done true lore music sound effect visual even color done well mission intens time viscer final mission cinemat moment seen game sinc mass effect think top pve fine want keep play grind gear pve lot fun well money well spent wonder chang pace helldiv unlik helldiv bug everyth seem polish none weapon seem feel underpow

"2022 Having put 200 hours in this game, reaching the soft cap in almost every attribute, having collected all legendary armaments, talismans, and spirit ashes, I can say for certain that this is one of the greatest games I have ever played and possibly will ever play in my life. This game is for die hard soulsborne fans and newcomers to the series alike. (and yes, this is a souls game I don't care what any elitist fan has to say.) The world of Elden Ring is a world filled with grandiose beauty, mystery around every corner, and a lore with a depth so unfathomable and secretive it at times shook me to my very core. The combat is so well done and polished, the weapon and armor designs were badass, and the character customization is the best it has ever been in a from software game. For newcomers, they have added the ability to fast travel to various spots on the absolutely daunting world map. While riding Torrent, your mount, you will experience some of the best mounted combat which had echos of legendary open world title Shadow of the Colossus and the final boss of Twilight Princess on Epona. Now, onto the difficulty. I know this has been a topic of debate among fans but I will give you my honest opinion having sunk hundreds of hours into the soulsborne titles: this is the most difficult soulsborne game to date and has undoubtedly two of the hardest boss battles I have ever faced in my 25 years of gaming. The gratification gained for sticking it to some of the bosses in this game was immense and full of a mix of overwhelming emotions. With all this being said, please, pick up this game, believe the hype, it is a masterwork for Miyazaki and the From Software team.",put hour game reach soft cap almost everi attribut collect legendari armament talisman spirit ash say certain one greatest game ever play possibl ever play life game die hard soulsborn fan newcom seri alik ye soul game dont care elitist fan say world elden ring world fill grandios beauti mysteri around everi corner lore depth unfathom secret time shook core combat well done polish weapon armor design badass charact custom best ever softwar game newcom ad abil fast travel variou spot absolut daunt world map ride torrent mount experi best mount combat echo legendari open world titl shadow colossu final boss twilight princess epona onto difficulti know topic debat among fan give honest opinion sunk hundr hour soulsborn titl difficult soulsborn game date undoubtedli two hardest boss battl ever face year game gratif gain stick boss game immens full mix overwhelm emot said pleas pick game believ hype masterwork miyazaki softwar team

"2022 Warhammer 3 like, Warhammer 2 - has some issues at launch; but no core problems which would make me it declare it dead on arrival like many AAA games these past few years. The major inconveniences I've experienced until now are minor stutters, odd UI elements and units in battle looking like they are in a mosh pit and not really attacking each other. I see these mostly as minor issues, bugs - which will eventually be ironed out and fixed by Creative Assembly. For the rest, like UI being too red (which I have no problem with), there will be mods to take care of them. To put it simply, this is a positive recommendation from me, simply because I feel that the game oozes with personality, care and charm - the animations are great, fun, the combat is a blast to look at, the new maps are great and it feels like overall a great deal of effort was put into making new interesting mechanics. One issue I've had until now, is that without the huge amount of unit variety from Warhammer 2 (especially towards the end) the game feels a bit lacking; but I 100% expect both more free units to come over time paired alongside paid DLC. In the past CA has shown a great deal of care towards Warhammer games, I see no reason why they would stop now.",warhamm like warhamm issu launch core problem would make declar dead arriv like mani aaa game past year major inconveni ive experienc minor stutter odd ui element unit battl look like mosh pit realli attack see mostli minor issu bug eventu iron fix creativ assembl rest like ui red problem mod take care put simpli posit recommend simpli feel game ooz person care charm anim great fun combat blast look new map great feel like overal great deal effort put make new interest mechan one issu ive without huge amount unit varieti warhamm especi toward end game feel bit lack expect free unit come time pair alongsid paid dlc past ca shown great deal care toward warhamm game see reason would stop

"Imagine a game where you’re a human struggling to survive in a world so hostile it makes a toddler’s tantrum look like a walk in the park. Welcome to Once Human, where the phrase “tough but fair” is replaced by “tough and absolutely unfair.”From the moment you start, it’s clear this game hates you with the intensity of a thousand suns. Want to explore? Great! You’ll be met with hostile creatures that seem to have taken a few tips from “How to Ruin Your Day 101.” Every step feels like a bad idea, and your character’s life expectancy is measured in milliseconds.The graphics are stunning, but so is the sheer terror of knowing that every shadow could be the last thing you see. Combat is a thrilling mix of “I hope I don’t die” and “I’m definitely going to die.” And the storyline? It’s like a Kafka novel but with more zombies and less existential dread.In short, Once Human is perfect for anyone who thinks their life isn’t stressful enough and could use a little digital despair. If you’re looking for a game to help you question your existence and enjoy a hearty laugh at your own misfortune, this is it.",imagin game your human struggl surviv world hostil make toddler tantrum look like walk park welcom human phrase tough fair replac tough absolut unfairfrom moment start clear game hate intens thousand sun want explor great youll met hostil creatur seem taken tip ruin day everi step feel like bad idea charact life expect measur millisecondsth graphic stun sheer terror know everi shadow could last thing see combat thrill mix hope dont die im definit go die storylin like kafka novel zombi less existenti dreadin short human perfect anyon think life isnt stress enough could use littl digit despair your look game help question exist enjoy hearti laugh misfortun
"2022 My review will remain negative despite a lot of good will being generated by Thrones of Decay.They're making a lot of great steps; individually purchaseable legendary lords, more content in the DLC than Shadows released and more exciting units as well, they brought back a FLC lord release for the expansion, faction reworks are back and for all 3 of the headline races as well. There's a lot of good stuff I like seeing here, but despite that I have to remind people, CA has apologized for the state of Warhammer 3 like three or four times since its release. Every step forward is two steps back for them. When I see them carry forward the consumer friendly choices they've rolled out for Thrones of Decay into the next DLC as well then I will change my review to a recommend. Don't forget, for every ""Champions of Chaos"" they release they tend to follow it up with a ""Shadows of Change"" and ""complaints are a privilege not a right"" controversy on their forums.This is an edited review: in quotes below was my previous review, made during the height of the Shadows of Change controversy and poor reception.""I put 800 hours into this game during its broken release and the year and half that followed where it was still broken.I love Total war warhammer, and stuck with it through what I thought was its lowest point. Unfortunately its still not over.The DLC pricing model is atrocious, even THEN I was on the fence about getting ""Shadows of Change"" but then they addressed the price hike and threatened/disrespected their playerbase. CA has finally lost deep veterans like me who have put in 2k-3k+ hours across the series. I won't be getting any more DLC's or putting in any more play hours into this game until CA publicly acknowledges its failings, apologizes, and changes its pricing.And based on what I'm seeing, I'm very much not alone.""",review remain neg despit lot good gener throne decaytheyr make lot great step individu purchas legendari lord content dlc shadow releas excit unit well brought back flc lord releas expans faction rework back headlin race well there lot good stuff like see despit remind peopl ca apolog state warhamm like three four time sinc releas everi step forward two step back see carri forward consum friendli choic theyv roll throne decay next dlc well chang review recommend dont forget everi champion chao releas tend follow shadow chang complaint privileg right controversi forumsthi edit review quot previou review made height shadow chang controversi poor receptioni put hour game broken releas year half follow still brokeni love total war warhamm stuck thought lowest point unfortun still overth dlc price model atroci even fenc get shadow chang address price hike threateneddisrespect playerbas ca final lost deep veteran like put hour across seri wont get dlc put play hour game ca publicli acknowledg fail apolog chang pricingand base im see im much alon

"2013 I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn.Another night of Insomnia. I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon™ HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus.I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind. My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze.I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia.Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning.My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished.Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn.The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room._Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people.Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway.Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before.I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value.I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came.The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow.My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade.I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head.I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7×28mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak™ display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words ""NOT ON MY WATCH"" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks.Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed.A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen.Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long- wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk._Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice. I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG; 9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself ""I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hate that gun"" while typing out ""#TAZED ♥♥♥♥♥"" in all chat.Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. ""get rekt"" ""u suck"" ""TIME to die, amirite""Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round.From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will.The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes.Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a ""REKT"" holographic sticker and renamed ""Clockwork ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it.Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never.Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet.Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to ♥♥♥♥ with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you.I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall.I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am.

"2022 I finished my first campaign today in WH3. For context, I did about 50 turns in my first campaign (Kislev, normal/normal) just to get a feel for the game, then went all in on my second run (Kislev again, legendary/easy). Wow...let me just say that without a doubt, this was the best campaign I've ever played in a Total War game. I've played most of them from the first Shogun all the way to WH1 and 2, and this was easily the best. Not a single dull moment, no feeling of that late game grind, the feel and atmosphere and mechanics were just phenomenal. Overall, amazing campaign, amazing game. Perfect?

"2023 The game would be awesome, but:- it's full of bugs (choke-full)- the powercreep has climbed over the roof and started building a rocket to reach the moon- the game designers seem to have lost touch with what made the Total War series fun: it has really questionable balancing and some very poor design choices- CA's strategy seem to be pumping out pricy DLCs with awesome art direction to wow the possible customers, but then deliver an unbalanced mess that breaks the game in some way or another- the game is unbearably easy. If you like seeing monsters smashing on each other, you may find it entertaining for a few hours; if you are looking for interesting choices, a challenging AI, and a good game experience, you'll be disappointed- the AI is somehow worse than in game 2, both in battle and campaignI have played the game a lot, modded it to try and make it make sense, but finally I gave up: it can't be saved, because CA cares more about short term profit margins than providing a good game.

The spyware thing is completely overblown and just because people see the game is Chinese.

"It's completely filled to the brim with cheaters. - VAC is the worst anti-cheat in existence. Valve takes HWID of users however, they will not ban based on HWID. They only ban by account so the hacker can just make a new one and do it all over again.- Valve is making a huge profit off NOT banning hackers. When a hacker gets their account banned, they just get another one and purchase prime ($15). Valve clearly sees this as a revenue source and will never actually take any real action against cheaters. - There is a secondary market for leveling fresh accounts to premiere and selling them, people use inexpensive hacks to level accounts and then re-sell them for more - People are running automated AI-based bots that can dupe weapons and automatically cheat same as in TF2 - Premiere game mode is completely off balance. Once you reach 10k+ ELO your matches will only net you ~50-100 ELO and you will lose between ~300-1000 every game. Complete timesink.- Valve's ""subtick"" is garbage. The game will always have peeker's advantage - if you have a high ping around around 50ms-100ms you will always have that much more time to see someone on your screen before they will see you- Public ""find a group"" feature is filled with Russians posing as ""professional"" players who invite you to lobbies, try to get you into a discord channel and then socially engineer you to ""signup for their team"" which is a steam account phishing page.Game is still fun and a classic - but is clearly still in an alpha development stage. Valve trying to claim or boast that CS2 is a ""competitive"" shooter is completely invalid. Any ""competitive"" teams are phony. Faceit, ESEA and competitive game modes all filled with blatant cheaters. You could dump years of time into this game trying to ""git gud"" but you will never beat the script kiddies let alone be able to keep up with the constant updates to the game mechanics.I highly encourage everyone to play this game on competitive/premiere mode and treat it as if completely casual, because it is.",complet fill brim cheater vac worst anticheat exist valv take hwid user howev ban base hwid ban account hacker make new one valv make huge profit ban hacker hacker get account ban get anoth one purchas prime valv clearli see revenu sourc never actual take real action cheater secondari market level fresh account premier sell peopl use inexpens hack level account resel peopl run autom aibas bot dupe weapon automat cheat premier game mode complet balanc reach elo match net elo lose everi game complet timesink valv subtick garbag game alway peeker advantag high ping around around alway much time see someon screen see public find group featur fill russian pose profession player invit lobbi tri get discord channel social engin signup team steam account phish pagegam still fun classic clearli still alpha develop stage valv tri claim boast competit shooter complet invalid competit team phoni faceit esea competit game mode fill blatant cheater could dump year time game tri git gud never beat script kiddi let alon abl keep constant updat game mechanicsi highli encourag everyon play game competitivepremier mode treat complet casual

"2015 Well hi and thanks for stopping by.After over 1000 hours of gameplay and reaching the LEM rank i consider myself expierenced player of CS:GO.If you are thinking about buying this game, you might find this review helpfull.What to start with... ? Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters.But thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible.Of course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do.When it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me.I mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive.Competetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank.Are there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet.But wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch.Overwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted. Well... what can I say10/10Looking forward to playing more.",well hi thank stop byafter hour gameplay reach lem rank consid expierenc player csgoif think buy game might find review helpfullwhat start sure look highli competet game compet player unlik exampl moba game win alway option beacous game person skill mattersbut that import thing game teach teamwork cours scream son solo win everi round goal game solo que competet put random game random peopl team random peopl enemi team differ nationaliy differ charact react thing differ time game teammat best friend suppos watch back coordin tactic execut best situat win round commun much possibleof cours bad day meet peopl speak languag bad day well tri grief loos game purpos that rare percentag person experi need alway stay posit calm team dowhen come game mechan csgo isnt complic origin compar fp game aim crosshair guy hold left mous button like tomorrow still hit tri chill bit tap mous dont run shoot stop aim fire way go cs get frustrat lot curs throw screen window dont worri master game better feel headshot awper deagl trust mei mention deagl high varieti weapon game pistol differ certain situat shotgun smg rifl even light machin gun choos negev sinc worthless alway felt mlg quickscop power vein buy awp power one shot kill unless hit leg poor buy go tasti headshot complet honest gun need master first place manag learn spray pattern long rang potenti power one shot headshot compar rifl power well except negev deagl gun mainli play good go play competetivecompetet game mode ye cours old popular arm race everyon shoot level gun end kill someon golden knife get demolit someth like competet allow buy gun level instead everi round get kill deatchmatch practic warm reccomend start game also get famou casual full unrank new player sometim bore global mostli peopl play csgo fun rankar gamemod seem bore cours plenti commun server allow play battl royal deathrun bhop server surf hide n seek zombi mode lot cool stuff havent manag discov yetbut wait game seem cool must catch ye dont know russian oh poor soul wish luck sinc yell lot also meet cheater obviou one spinbot around kill wall boost rank noob pay meet tri boost themself slight aim assist bhop script bare notic rare meet cheater regulari fulfil duti part overwatchoverwatch system implement game allow player watch demo game somebodi got report person got report pov see complet anonymu also help catch peopl somehow avoid vac system dont think get access easili take timelast thing want mention skin like csgo economi money buy key key trade skin skin get skin sinc skin must pro player right that silli skin use game cost joke loos money open case get kinki knife skin alway want dont get addict sinc spent way money skin want well forward play

And after the huge piles of triple ""A"" suck that have been shoveled down our throats for ages now...it nice to actually enjoy something again.Being a huge WH40k fan on the side helped for sure, but SM2 is the best experience in gaming I have had in a long, long time.",game coupl decad like breath fresh air like put old comfi warm sweater nostalg feel back longlong ago game fun polit litmu test brought back feel enjoy everi game becam open world linear skill progress tree pretend role play brought back joy earn thing play didnt suck huge pile tripl suck shovel throat age nowit nice actual enjoy someth againb huge fan side help sure best experi game long long time

The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. cut to Barry's room, where he's picking out what to wearBarry Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

It's a special day, finally graduating.Adam: Never thought I'd make it.Barry: Yeah, three days grade school, three days high school.Adam: Those were so awkward.Barry: Three days college.

"Okay so where should we start.... I love the game but there is so many things that should get fixed in order for the game to become 10/10 for everyone and not only for the Counter-Strike lovers. Release of CS2 was really bad they just released the Beta... No new skins, no new operation, no new maps (many maps from CS:GO are not in the game anymore). The game has very bad perfomance issues even on High End systems. It's very easily noticable that in CS2 your spray feels a bit of compared to CS:GO. Let's get over to the worst part about everything and that is that CS2 has a massive cheating problem, I have probably been playing versus over 20 cheaters in my time on CS2 and this is way too much in my opinion. We also have the report system which is completly f*cked. I have gotten griefing banned multiple times without killing a single teammate, not blocking or teamflashes NOTHING. Where is this game going? And as far as I know there hasn't been any cheater that I reported that got banned. So my question to you Valve is, are you happy with the product that you released? In conclusion I do not recommend new players to this game unless the things I listed are getting fixed.

"""In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war""From the moment you step into your power armor, you’re no longer just a human, you’re a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ walking cathedral of destruction, blessed by the Emperor’s divine will. Xenos? Heretics? Chaos-worshipping filth? They’re not your enemies, they’re your next target practice. Reload, deliver, and repeat until the galaxy is cleansed. The Combat It’s pure, undiluted rage made flesh. You don’t just kill your enemies, you annihilate them with every pull of the trigger, as if the Emperor himself is screaming “Purge harder!” in your ears! The Story It's simple, if it’s not human, it dies. You don’t need context or a reason; they’re xenos, they exist, that’s enough to condemn them. You are the Emperor’s fist, and the galaxy is your punching bag. Pros: Combat: Feels like the Emperor is constantly high-fiving you with each alien head you pop. Graphics: The gothic aesthetic is so good that it might just convert you into the Ecclesiarchy. Seriously, there are more skulls here than a Necron fashion show. Immersion: It’s as Warhammer as it gets. Every word, every bolt round, every alien screams, “This is for the Emperor!” Soundtrack: Epic, orchestral score that makes every fight feel like a holy war. The game might just double your manliness thanks to its intense, testosterone-fueled action Cons: The keybindings might feel like they were designed by a heretic, but fear not. adjust them, and your controls will be as precise as a Space Marine's aim Some minor bugs and crashes, but honestly, that’s probably just Nurgle trying to mess with your game. Purge your system, brother. Tyranids don't scream enough when you smash 'em. Could use more screaming.9/10 – Would obliterate xenos and heretics again while screaming ‘FOR THE EMPEROR!’",grim dark far futur warfrom moment step power armor your longer human your walk cathedr destruct bless emperor divin xeno heret chaosworship filth theyr enemi theyr next target practic reload deliv repeat galaxi cleans combat pure undilut rage made flesh dont kill enemi annihil everi pull trigger emperor scream purg harder ear stori simpl human die dont need context reason theyr xeno exist that enough condemn emperor fist galaxi punch bag pro combat feel like emperor constantli highfiv alien head pop graphic gothic aesthet good might convert ecclesiarchi serious skull necron fashion show immers warhamm get everi word everi bolt round everi alien scream emperor soundtrack epic orchestr score make everi fight feel like holi war game might doubl manli thank intens testosteronefuel action con keybind might feel like design heret fear adjust control precis space marin aim minor bug crash honestli that probabl nurgl tri mess game purg system brother tyranid dont scream enough smash em could use would obliter xeno heret scream emperor

"2022 This is one of my favorite games I have ever played, it has grabbed my attention and held it with an iron grip. Anytime I figure out what I wanna do, it's very hard to resist the siren call of ELDEN RING.The exploration in this game is absolutely a treat, it really feels like discoveries can be made in every little nook and cranny. With some boldness and knowledge of how far you can fall without dying, there are very few places you can't get to, and usually will be rewarded for taking the time to explore it all.The combat is extremely polished, every playstyle is viable and can have a ton of fun variety within those styles. Most enemies and bosses are incredibly awesome to just LOOK at, let alone actually fight and overcome. Not all of them can be winners, but with the sheer volume and variety already on display, I believe that's fully excusable. From the replayability and ridiculous amount of content here, I believe that anyone who isn't afraid of some level of difficulty should give this a shot and be delighted by what it offers.",one favorit game ever play grab attent held iron grip anytim figur wan na hard resist siren call elden ringth explor game absolut treat realli feel like discoveri made everi littl nook cranni bold knowledg far fall without die place cant get usual reward take time explor allth combat extrem polish everi playstyl viabl ton fun varieti within style enemi boss incred awesom look let alon actual fight overcom winner sheer volum varieti alreadi display believ that fulli excus replay ridicul amount content believ anyon isnt afraid level difficulti give shot delight offer

"2022 I like FROM's games and in my opinion this is their best game yet. It has open world dungeons and locations to explore, but it also has ""levels"" that are the bottleneck for opening up the next part of the story or area which feels very souls-esque and is what keeps the flow very varied.I've been to a particular place 3 times and never came across ""the chest"" people talk about, nor did I encounter the enemy there that everyone talks about, but I did find a chest that most people miss. It's kind of wild how different people can go to the same area and have totally different experiences or miss certain things. The game is very generous with its ""bonfires"" aka sites of grace, which was surprising to me.The difficulty is still there and if you aren't feeling like it is for the first chapter it will start presenting itself in later chapters for most players. Your health stats are more important than ever this time around. If you don't have a good 20 to 30 points into Vigor you'll get one-shot by a lot of stuff, so keep that in mind!TIP: If you aren't sure about a boss yet and you don't want to cross the fog unwittingly, just put your summon sign down and help people as many times as you want to learn the boss patterns and even get free souls/items along the way!!! No shame!If you like Dark Souls in any way or if you want a brutal fantasy adventure, yes I recommend this.

"2022 Elden Ring is the latest game developed by FromSoftware, a company well-known for its Souls franchise. This time, FromSoftware took a departure from its standard linear/semi-open world approach to its game development. Instead, it opted for an open-world approach, with heavy reliance on Souls’ game mechanics. After I learned that Elden Ring would be developed as an open-world Souls game, I was worried about how the game would turn out. However, Elden Ring turned out to be something far better than I had imagined.Pros:- A vast world filled with activities, secrets, sidequests, enemies, and bosses that will entertain players for hundreds of hours- A wonderful sense of exploration that is unparalleled in its scope and design- Boss battles that are difficult yet extremely satisfying - Beautiful graphics that show noticeable improvements over older titles, such as Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro- Great map system that guides players in the right direction and helps them search for secrets and activities. - A wide variety of weapons with different ashes of war that allows for diverse gameplay- An intuitive and efficient weapon upgrade system - A wide variety of spells, incantations, talismans, and armors to choose from - Stellar aesthetics/art design Cons:- Performance issues: micro-stuttering and framerate drops that got better compared to the launch version but still need more work - While enemies/bosses are mostly fair, a few of them are overly difficult and can feel a little cheap Overall, I think Elden Ring is a masterpiece that offers new possibilities to an open-world genre, which has become somewhat stale in recent years. Similar to what Breath of the Wild did five years ago, Elden Ring proves that the open-world genre can evolve and become something truly remarkable.",elden ring latest game develop fromsoftwar compani wellknown soul franchis time fromsoftwar took departur standard linearsemiopen world approach game develop instead opt openworld approach heavi relianc soul game mechan learn elden ring would develop openworld soul game worri game would turn howev elden ring turn someth far better imaginedpro vast world fill activ secret sidequest enemi boss entertain player hundr hour wonder sens explor unparallel scope design boss battl difficult yet extrem satisfi beauti graphic show notic improv older titl dark soul sekiro great map system guid player right direct help search secret activ wide varieti weapon differ ash war allow divers gameplay intuit effici weapon upgrad system wide varieti spell incant talisman armor choos stellar aestheticsart design con perform issu microstutt framer drop got better compar launch version still need work enemiesboss mostli fair overli difficult feel littl cheap overal think elden ring masterpiec offer new possibl openworld genr becom somewhat stale recent year similar breath wild five year ago elden ring prove openworld genr evolv becom someth truli remark

"Emperor forgive me for I am about to speak heresy, but I cannot recommend this game, surely the ruinous powers have corrupted this gift from the Emperor. It plays like any button masher fighting game where you have to press the block button when the bright light icon flashes or press the dodge button when the other bright light flashes. Like other third person fighting button mashers of this genre, ( looking at you Shadow of War ) you're just a weak little guy that can get interrupted repeatedly by any and all enemies when making an attack but when you're right in the enemy's face with a chain sword the enemy acts as if all you're doing is poking them in the face with a stick. Compare this to a game like Bolt Gun where you feel the weight of a Space Marine, where you feel like a Space Marine, and this game comes up more like a clunky third person button masher fighting game rather than a tactical third person shooter where you play the role of a genetically engineered superhuman fighting hordes of xeno scum. 90% of the game I felt weaker than the enemy, and all the special xeno enemies usually just spammed some bs move like any third person button masher and if you miss the prompt, uh oh, there goes most of your health! Honestly the game is more frustrating and though the scenes were beautiful, the atmosphere of the 40k universe absolutely immersive and the overall amazing look of the game, it can't get beyond a clunky combat system that makes you feel more like you're playing Elden Ring having to spam dodge roll away from enemies because if a bunch of specials group up around you, you're basically dead. I know the whole being able to play as your favorite space marine chapter is something not seen much in other 40k video games but honestly, the PvE only has 6 missions at the moment, the PvP was tacked on seemingly at the last minute, and the campaign is an absolute joke for what it's claiming to be. Space Marine sim? The combination of clunky controls, auto hitting enemies with overpowered abilities, and mid to trash combat that makes you feel more like a member of the Astra Militarium than an Ultramarine.Edit: Why in Horus's great bushy bum did the devs decide to give the Tzeetch beastmen invulnerable shields that can only really be broken if you power attack them? That'd be like giving every Tyrannid grunt a shield and saying 'ah ah ah only power attacks' the amount of times I've been surrounded by these shield guys getting ripped apart by thousand sun space marines from a distance because I have to power attack through a whole horde of shielded enemies is completely ridiculous! It's a horde game, you want the low level enemies to be easily killed so you can focus on the high level enemies! Instead it turns into a mosh pit where you lose all your health because you have to focus power attack on each shield man while they keep hitting you every single second.",emperor forgiv speak heresi recommend game sure ruinou power corrupt gift emperor play like button masher fight game press block button bright light icon flash press dodg button bright light flash like third person fight button masher genr look shadow war your weak littl guy get interrupt repeatedli enemi make attack your right enemi face chain sword enemi act your poke face stick compar game like bolt gun feel weight space marin feel like space marin game come like clunki third person button masher fight game rather tactic third person shooter play role genet engin superhuman fight hord xeno scum game felt weaker enemi special xeno enemi usual spam bs move like third person button masher miss prompt uh oh goe health honestli game frustrat though scene beauti atmospher univers absolut immers overal amaz look game cant get beyond clunki combat system make feel like your play elden ring spam dodg roll away enemi bunch special group around your basic dead know whole abl play favorit space marin chapter someth seen much video game honestli pve mission moment pvp tack seemingli last minut campaign absolut joke claim space marin sim combin clunki control auto hit enemi overpow abil mid trash combat make feel like member astra militarium ultramarineedit horuss great bushi bum dev decid give tzeetch beastmen invulner shield realli broken power attack thatd like give everi tyrannid grunt shield say ah ah ah power attack amount time ive surround shield guy get rip apart thousand sun space marin distanc power attack whole hord shield enemi complet ridicul hord game want low level enemi easili kill focu high level enemi instead turn mosh pit lose health focu power attack shield man keep hit everi singl second

"2023 This game on its own is ok but it is a true gem when you can assemble the previous games and its DLC into a state of completeness. I love this series and it will likely go down as one of my all time favorites. That being said, I cannot recommend this game for the very same reason.Creative Assembly has time and again left game breaking bugs for months upon months and have recently allowed a critical part of a paid DLC (Kroxigors for Nakai from The Hunter and the Beast) broken to the point that essentially half the DLC was unplayable. Don't worry, they were still happy to charge full price for it during this time. The most recent DLC has a massive price hike with debateably less content. On top of this, the FreeLC offers nowhere near the benefit of what has been historically accompanied a DLC release.The devs and artists do amazing work and create fantastic experiences when they're properly staffed and funded but I cannot recommend a game that is essentially the scaffolding to hang great DLC off of when the DLC and support is failing to deliver. This game is being treated as a money pinata by the leadership of the company to fund other projects and I cannot recommend this product or any other from Creative Assembly while it is so blatantly being given the least amount of attention possible while charging as much as possible.Edit: I want to make sure its clear that I cannot recommend a game or its DLC when its possible that what you buy may get critically broken and then not fixed for months. Even if the content itself is worth the price at the time there is no excuse to have multiple instances of paid-for content being left broken for months.",game ok true gem assembl previou game dlc state complet love seri like go one time favorit said recommend game reasoncr assembl time left game break bug month upon month recent allow critic part paid dlc kroxigor nakai hunter beast broken point essenti half dlc unplay dont worri still happi charg full price time recent dlc massiv price hike debat less content top freelc offer nowher near benefit histor accompani dlc releaseth dev artist amaz work creat fantast experi theyr properli staf fund recommend game essenti scaffold hang great dlc dlc support fail deliv game treat money pinata leadership compani fund project recommend product creativ assembl blatantli given least amount attent possibl charg much possibleedit want make sure clear recommend game dlc possibl buy may get critic broken fix month even content worth price time excus multipl instanc paidfor content left broken month
2022 Things to do in Caelid: #1. Leave,thing caelid leav
2022 WAAAAAAAAAAGH,waaaaaaaaaagh
"2016 11/29/23Game is rampart with cheaters and many team killers, they will shoot on spawn because you do not speak their language for no reason, it is very common, they will persist until they get banned. You cannot do anything about it and Valve just does not care.The only thing certain is that you will loose the game. I can send you as many replays as you want with this.10/15/23 review update/revised reviewI gave a try to CS:2 today, I played 5 games. It is by far the worst gaming experience I ever had in my entire life.To begin with I believe when I left CS:GO some weeks ago I had the rank of either DMG or LE. I do not remember. Then I was like let's try the new game, I was very excited. After these 5 games I was left stunned, wondering the state of our race and the prospects of our future. Either the IQ of the general population has dropped or the game attracts creatures that their categorization as ""human"" in some circles could be at best questionable to the extent that it makes you rethink some your values, like your stance against abortion and other sensitive matters that have been solved many years now regarding the humanity as a species..I need to add for context that I never swear at my teamates, I never insult them, I never shoot them back but in the last game I actually lost my tempter, to the point that things got out of hand, I realized that the last game was no different from the previous ones, I just had enough.I will explain.If you enjoy playing with people that choose random maps - THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW - like Vertigo (I do not even know why this map is in the ranked pool anyway), teammates that shoot you, disconnect for no reason, in general scream on the microphone or do not understand the basic fundamentals of the complicated concept of the ""Bomb defusal"" game rules and game style, then yes! You have found your game! Your teamates will rush towards the enemy even if they are CT, they will mostly die in the first 10 seconds and then they will either start cursing at you at you or teamkill you at spawn, flash you or other stuff, what can you do?ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. You will be forced to spend the next minutes of your life with them, I mean about people that must find the tree that produces the oxygen they spend and to whom they need to apologize for their inexcusable behavior towards other human beings. Valve doesn't give a flying fifu about your fun, or the toxic people you are forced to play with.It is nearly impossible to comprehend the level of toxicity and darkness that you will endure playing this game and having to live with this Exercise in futility, comparing this to works of Russian authors like Dostoevsky, Solzhenitsyn and Tolstoy will make you feel you are reading a woke Hollywood comedy.Old review --->I had a lot of fun some years back in the 2012-2014 reaching the rank of Supreme mostly playing with friends but also as solo. I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene. WTF has happened? This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.DON'T GET ME WRONG HEREI have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.There is huge but in all this:Are you willing to pay a subscription?If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates. And this scenario this year doesn't happen for the first time.",rampart cheater mani team killer shoot spawn speak languag reason common persist get ban anyth valv careth thing certain loos game send mani replay want review updaterevis reviewi gave tri today play game far worst game experi ever entir lifeto begin believ left csgo week ago rank either dmg le rememb like let tri new game excit game left stun wonder state race prospect futur either iq gener popul drop game attract creatur categor human circl could best question extent make rethink valu like stanc abort sensit matter solv mani year regard human speciesi need add context never swear teamat never insult never shoot back last game actual lost tempter point thing got hand realiz last game differ previou one enoughi explainif enjoy play peopl choos random map know like vertigo even know map rank pool anyway teammat shoot disconnect reason gener scream microphon understand basic fundament complic concept bomb defus game rule game style ye found game teamat rush toward enemi even ct mostli die first second either start curs teamkil spawn flash stuff doabsolut noth forc spend next minut life mean peopl must find tree produc oxygen spend need apolog inexcus behavior toward human be valv doesnt give fli fifu fun toxic peopl forc play withit nearli imposs comprehend level toxic dark endur play game live exercis futil compar work russian author like dostoevski solzhenitsyn tolstoy make feel read woke hollywood comedyold review lot fun year back reach rank suprem mostli play friend also solo came back year tri game absenc scene wtf happen game worst commun possibl antagon one lol guess thing wors dont speak russian doom play competit server peopl dont speak english match guy use voip system speak russian even player team commun shoot tri kick think someth wrongdont get wrong herei lot russian friend game realli nice peopleapart russian anoth portion commun immatur peopl go harsh teammat bash troll gener tri prove someth disput mani case end player either attack defend leav game get ban friendli fire time play end play match least dmg le level play year team game cant win peopl dont get reach higher level skill doesnt mean also good player term tactic strategiesanoth neg thing rate server competit system use believ set allow distant player decent ping andor save resourc server thing ruin game make aim realli funni understand ever go lan server play tick rate server result play total differ game way rate work attack player alway advantag prefir wont leav defend time reactther huge thisar will pay subscriptionif dedic friend play game guarante excel time decid go play somewher pay play like esea faceit better commun find descent peopl valu money will play higher level without take love mention abovethi review written frustrat play consecut game non englshspeak teammat scenario year doesnt happen first time
"Of course, this game has some problems here and there, but overall it's acceptable and plays pretty well. I would say this is a ""cozy place to relax"" type of game. Just want to mention that there is no controller support and there is no full-fledged coop, for someone like me this may be important.But the main problem for me, who enjoys creating characters more than anything else and can spend dozens of hours creating different characters, is the poor decision on the appearance. At first it looked very tempting and promising. But then you realize that things like skin type, minor scratches, etc. are fixed to the default preset you choose at start, and later in the game if you want to change your skin type you need to change the character preset and you can't do that freely, you have to you pay about 10 euros for it each time, and it’s sad that changing such simple things are behind paywall",cours game problem overal accept play pretti well would say cozi place relax type game want mention control support fullfledg coop someon like may importantbut main problem enjoy creat charact anyth els spend dozen hour creat differ charact poor decis appear first look tempt promis realiz thing like skin type minor scratch etc fix default preset choos start later game want chang skin type need chang charact preset cant freeli pay euro time sad chang simpl thing behind paywal

"2022 ELDEN RING, O ELDEN RING...Where to begin with this one? Fromsoftware's journey from Demon's Souls in 2009 all the way to here leaves us in the incredible foundations of what could be considered their best game yet, utilising the familiar Soulsborne format while spinning it into a full-fledged open world. The game is utterly jam packed with things to discover, fight, and oddball characters with weird, esoteric stories and motives. A game with an insane vision and incredible imagination.Having finished it about 160 hours in, my expectations probably should have been tempered. Context time; I've beaten almost every game in Fromsoftware's modern lineup with the exception of Demon's Souls, due to not owning a PS3 or PS5. I've gone out of my way to seek the greatest challenges, from Charmless/Demon Bell runs in Sekiro to the Queen Yharnam trophy in Bloodborne. Elden Ring starts off not too dissimilar to Dark Souls 3 and will seem incredibly familiar from there, with the magic meter returning (along with split Healing/magic bar flasks) and its weapon arts exchanged for a new system called Ashes of War, allowing you to chop and change various skills into a variety of mundane weapons, creating entirely brand new playstyles and strategies. Magic is stronger than ever with spell slots being completely independent of the stat that increases your magic bar, actively encouraging you to seek out magic to use. This makes the game's first stretch incredibly replayable as you experiment with various Ashes and spell and weapon combinations that compliment each other. Even better is that exploration from your first playthrough is rewarded in the next, as you can skip a surprising number of bosses and encounters to find strong equipment or spells early and use it as a base for your new run. This is some of the best character building in any of these games, and the world never stops being absolutely breathtaking to look at and experience.Unfortunately, it seems Elden Ring eventually buckles under its ambitions in an attempt to top what came before it. The game is relatively challenging from Limgrave all the way up to past the Altus Plateau and Leyndell, the Royal Capital, and then skyrockets in difficulty. In recognising that the game has to somehow challenge dozens of different player character builds and hundreds of potential Ash of War combinations, it becomes what might be Fromsoftware's hardest game ever put to code. What were once difficult bosses are now reused as regular enemies with impunity. Input reading is rampant, gank bosses are common place, enemies are Sekiro/Bloodborne-tier aggressive with staggered combos and extreme delays and area-of-effect attacks in a game where you play as a relatively slow Dark Souls 3 character. Lategame healthpools are absolutely titanic, difficult to stance break, and even characters with high damage numbers begin to struggle without help from summons, Bleed or Frostbite (especially Bleed, given it's a status proc that scales infinitely no matter how big the healthbar).The open world format both benefits and hurts the game, because almost all of its good design is in 60-80% of its runtime, with the last two areas being a gauntlet of no less than five of the absolute hardest bosses in the game. By the time I was done with those monsters-- four of which I could not at all beat without the help of a certain extremely strong spirit summon-- I was fatigued, and incredibly tired, rather than feeling accomplished at all. My advice is to play as dirty as humanly possible if you're struggling with those. It's a life or death battle, after all.Despite those few hitches just before an absolutely fantastic ending, I'd say Elden Ring is still worth your money and time, if you can spare either. Don't go in expecting anything other than another Dark Souls, this time with some of the words switched around and much bigger, and you'll have a grand time of it.",elden ring elden ringwher begin one fromsoftwar journey demon soul way leav us incred foundat could consid best game yet utilis familiar soulsborn format spin fullfledg open world game utterli jam pack thing discov fight oddbal charact weird esoter stori motiv game insan vision incred imaginationhav finish hour expect probabl temper context time ive beaten almost everi game fromsoftwar modern lineup except demon soul due own ive gone way seek greatest challeng charmlessdemon bell run sekiro queen yharnam trophi bloodborn elden ring start dissimilar dark soul seem incred familiar magic meter return along split healingmag bar flask weapon art exchang new system call ash war allow chop chang variou skill varieti mundan weapon creat entir brand new playstyl strategi magic stronger ever spell slot complet independ stat increas magic bar activ encourag seek magic use make game first stretch incred replay experi variou ash spell weapon combin compliment even better explor first playthrough reward next skip surpris number boss encount find strong equip spell earli use base new run best charact build game world never stop absolut breathtak look experienceunfortun seem elden ring eventu buckl ambit attempt top came game rel challeng limgrav way past altu plateau leyndel royal capit skyrocket difficulti recognis game somehow challeng dozen differ player charact build hundr potenti ash war combin becom might fromsoftwar hardest game ever put code difficult boss reus regular enemi impun input read rampant gank boss common place enemi sekirobloodborneti aggress stagger combo extrem delay areaofeffect attack game play rel slow dark soul charact lategam healthpool absolut titan difficult stanc break even charact high damag number begin struggl without help summon bleed frostbit especi bleed given statu proc scale infinit matter big healthbarth open world format benefit hurt game almost good design runtim last two area gauntlet less five absolut hardest boss game time done monster four could beat without help certain extrem strong spirit summon fatigu incred tire rather feel accomplish advic play dirti humanli possibl your struggl life death battl alldespit hitch absolut fantast end id say elden ring still worth money time spare either dont go expect anyth anoth dark soul time word switch around much bigger youll grand time
"Having never played souls before I find this game incredibly hard, not so hard I want to destroy my controller - but damn hard. Of course I'm not a gamer and I don't usually review games, but the biased nonsense from the... ahem... 'game journalists...' has made me give this an honest review. Amazing. Wukong is worth every penny. The graphics are great, you fee like an anime protag when you jump or complete certain moves. You can reset your skill points at anytime at a shrine for free and it allows you to play different styles to try them out. Also if a boss is too hard you can go back beat up some mobs, get more points and get stronger. It's a linear game but the paths make it feel like a small open world at times. all in all a great game and you should play. The only bad part is I have a 14th gen intell POS chip and I had to reduce the overclocking to play without it crashing. I also had to set global lighting lower to be able to see the dark areas as sometimes it was just black on my screen. If its crashing for you download the intel xtreme utility and reduce the overclock modifier (?) I had to reduce mine to x53 before it stopped crashing. now it only happens once every few days which to me is acceptable.",never play soul find game incred hard hard want destroy control damn hard cours im gamer dont usual review game bias nonsens ahem game journalist made give honest review amaz wukong worth everi penni graphic great fee like anim protag jump complet certain move reset skill point anytim shrine free allow play differ style tri also boss hard go back beat mob get point get stronger linear game path make feel like small open world time great game play bad part gen intel po chip reduc overclock play without crash also set global light lower abl see dark area sometim black screen crash download intel xtreme util reduc overclock modifi reduc mine stop crash happen everi day accept

"Pros:Graphics, voice-acting are good. An attempt was made to be faithful to the lore. Decent visuals of combat, good amount of finishers, gore, and satisfying kills.Weapon upgrade system provides some level of meta.Cons:Gameplay - clunky. the Space Marines don't move like Space Marines, but rather more like Fallout power armor... maybe even less agile. Do you want 6 different kinds of boltguns that all kinda suck? How about low ammo for all weapons? Remember the last little guy in Vermintide 1 that would do most of the damage after a fight? Those guys are in here.Price - very expensive for what you are gettingUI - very cumbersome: long presses with confirm windows are common, controls obviously made for console/controllerLore - they mostly do a decent job, but then will randomly have glaring errors. For instance, the Iron Warriors main colour being gold... what. The commanding officer of the Cadians has an accent different from her troops for... reasons? Speaking of, the Cadians are done dirty. They are in no way capable of holding the line against the Tyranids unless they are given plot armor. The banter between Space Marines is probably not something that would occur either. Some of the flavor text for the legions/chapters is wrong (Minotaurs come to mind). Scaling - is off. Vehicles are too small, CSM are too big compared to Primaris. Campaign/Story - 'Hey SM1, can I copy your homework? Sure, just change it a bit so it looks different.""Other game modes:Operations (PVE): linear maps, same objectives, same maps, same enemies. Eternal War (PVP): I had no interest in playing. Obviously tacked on at the end. Chaos doesnt have any cosmetic customization other than color. For instance, do you want a green World Eater? How about a yellow Deathguard? CSM weapons are the same, even though they shouldn't be (they are reskins of primaris equivalents).Classes - absolute cancer. You are restricted to only taking 1 class on missions (so of 3 players in PVE, they MUST be a unique class). Maybe this is primaris ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or maybe this is a gameplay choice. Not sure, but it seems like a random injection of hero shooter to something that isnt. This game is gonna have a very short lifespan. Compared to other 40k titles that have released recently, this simply does not compete.I'll probably keep playing it, as several of my friends are and request my assistance... and to get my money's worth.",prosgraph voiceact good attempt made faith lore decent visual combat good amount finish gore satisfi killsweapon upgrad system provid level metaconsgameplay clunki space marin dont move like space marin rather like fallout power armor mayb even less agil want differ kind boltgun kinda suck low ammo weapon rememb last littl guy vermintid would damag fight guy herepric expens gettingui cumbersom long press confirm window common control obvious made consolecontrollerlor mostli decent job randomli glare error instanc iron warrior main colour gold command offic cadian accent differ troop reason speak cadian done dirti way capabl hold line tyranid unless given plot armor banter space marin probabl someth would occur either flavor text legionschapt wrong minotaur come mind scale vehicl small csm big compar primari campaignstori hey copi homework sure chang bit look differentoth game modesoper pve linear map object map enemi etern war pvp interest play obvious tack end chao doesnt cosmet custom color instanc want green world eater yellow deathguard csm weapon even though shouldnt reskin primari equivalentsclass absolut cancer restrict take class mission player pve must uniqu class mayb primari mayb gameplay choic sure seem like random inject hero shooter someth isnt game gon na short lifespan compar titl releas recent simpli competeil probabl keep play sever friend request assist get money worth

"2022 Elden RingLet me start by saying this was the first game I played created by FromSoftware (well except for killing the first boss in DS3 - which doesn't really count, does it?). I wasn't caught up in the Elden Ring hype and I wasn't really interested in the game even after it's release. It didn't even come up in my mind to even look at it, as I thought it wouldn't be the right game for me. And oh boy was that a mistake. About a month ago I finally decided to look into the game and almost instantly decided to get it.Not being interested in the game from the start actually made me enjoy it that much more. I wasn't hyped up from any trailers, media or rumors. I went into the game with a clean slate. And it was amazing. From the first time hearing the AWESOME soundtrack in the menu to exploring the crazy world of Lands Between - and let me tell you I barely scratched the surface of what the world has to offer.The world really feels alive. It's crazy how from previous - mostly linear - games the devs managed to create such an impressive open world. The map is HUGE and there isn't an area which feels empty and out of place. Each location really feels different and tells it's own story.There are some let's say tedious locations, I'm looking at you Mountaintops of the Giants, that get a bit annoying after playing through the game several times. Nevertheless even these snow-covered depressing hills deserve a special places in any gamer's heart. I won't mention any other locations because it would be a sin to spoil any of them.Locations being behind us, let's move onto the people inhabiting the Lands Between. The NPCs are there for themselves not for the player. That makes them feel really alive - you've never met this guy? Well he certainly doesn't care because he was doing his thing anyways. And that's crazy. The world is constantly evolving and the NPCs are too. And not just that, the people you meet during your adventure are as interesting as it gets. There weren't many times I could certainly say ""Okay, this NPC is good, pure-hearted and they will surely stay that way!"". The craziest thing is you might not meet even half of the NPCs if you're just playing the game for the sake of reaching the end.Bosses will kick your ass and those bastards will look cool doing it. Damn I wish I was born a cool boss too. But hey tough luck foul tarnished. Get some shiny gear and kick their ass for a change. After all you're ambitious and surely not foolish at all - Margit the goat fanboy.Elden Ring has 6 unique endings. That's all I'm gonna say about that. Though don't expect to be an Elden Ring Expert after your first... or tenth playthrough. The lore is, as FromSoft is known for, hidden in every possible way there is. You get a new weapon? You thought, it's lore in disguise. You got a completely useless pot which is completely useless? Oh wait it's got ten paragraphs of lore in it's description. Honestly if you really want to know atleast a bit of lore or you're interested in a certain character, I recommend you to look up external sources about them, such as youtube videos or useful lore sites. But be warned, there are still numerous mysteries which even the most notorious loreheads are still uncertain about. But hey, that's the beauty of it all, isn't it?I have to say, I don't think there currently is and for a long time will be any better entry point to FromSoft games. Even though, Elden Ring still doesn't exactly help you get through and still kicks your ass every chance it gets, it's a fun ass kicking. And I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone even a bit interested in the genre or in the game itself.It might even be time to announce a DLC reveal, what do you say FromSoft? ...pretty please?TLDR: Game of the year - do I need to add anything else? Wait... Actually I do. There are Waifus.

Seriously though, only thing wrong with the game is the cost of the latest DLC. Looks like it introduced some fun mechanics into the game, but I'm sorry we've already had scheme-y factions added (See, all Skaven especially Snikch, and Tzeench daemons). We as a community can understand needing to raise the prices for future DLC but making is a sudden 150% hike above the previous cost is just nasty. The Chaos Dwarves DLC price raise was risky but we all thought it was arguably worth it for a ""new"" race, but still expensive for what it is because let's be honest it's just a variation of existing in game races. The moment the cost of your DLC returns to a reasonable level this review will be changed to recommend, but until then I can't recommend my favorite game to anyone.

"2022 The gameplay, race options, the prologue and the overall experience (strategic game) are fun and impressive. The game is beautiful and immersive. But, and it's a rage quit kind of but, you hit turn 30 of the chaos campaign and the mechanics kicks in and it all goes downhill. While the portals are exciting and some of the realm are fun and thematic, having other factions rush you at that time (preventing you from visiting them) and having the realm experience feel long and unfair (at least you can auto-resolve the last battle) drains the fun out of it. I finished it once, made it to the fourth soul before deciding it wasn't worth finishing on the 2nd playthrough and keep dropping out earlier and earlier on the other playthrough I've tried. Overall, I feel there's a really fun game underneath but that the campaign kills the enjoyment out of it. Having played the immortal empire campaign my review kinda stands : it feels ridiculously unbalanced from one faction to the next and, having tried many, I'm finding that it's a mix of fun and frustration. The base game fun is there but playing whack-a-mole on armies trashing your unprotectable smaller settlements, the sometimes stacked-against-you-against-logic of the AI and very uneven enjoyability of the different races and mechanics makes playing the game a frustrating experience.",gameplay race option prologu overal experi strateg game fun impress game beauti immers rage quit kind hit turn chao campaign mechan kick goe downhil portal excit realm fun themat faction rush time prevent visit realm experi feel long unfair least autoresolv last battl drain fun finish made fourth soul decid wasnt worth finish playthrough keep drop earlier earlier playthrough ive tri overal feel there realli fun game underneath campaign kill enjoy play immort empir campaign review kinda stand feel ridicul unbalanc one faction next tri mani im find mix fun frustrat base game fun play whackamol armi trash unprotect smaller settlement sometim stackedagainstyouagainstlog ai uneven enjoy differ race mechan make play game frustrat experi

"2022 Where to start?Well, the game is broken. You can loose it, by sheer bad luck due to its game mechanics.So you can spend 100ish hours on doing all the right moves in a campaing and then you get squashed by randomness making a AI faction with 4 settlements on the opposite side of the map able to win faster than you. And there is nothing you can do about it and latest patch did NOTHING to fix this ♥♥♥♥.The realms of the Gods are broken, especially Tzeenth.Other than that, the Chaos Undivided Faction really is a poor excuse for a faction, the Daemon lord really is just a weird jack of all/no trades. And gives no joy to play with really. Cathay is weirdly overpowered and the Kislevites are just having a bad time. Playing as Khorne you just dominate everything and dont get me started on the broken Auto Resolve, with 3x the strength you will still risk loosing 90% of your forces on something that might cost you 2% if you play it. Game is weirdly consistent on really demanding that you play the battles no matter how trivial.Oh, and if you got a bad ass lord as a Chaos faction, and the lord gets the nurgle corruption trait, you can now never loose the trait and your lord is actually broken since his forces will never regenerate, not even in a city. And you always end up getting this trait while fighting Nurgle. Broken mechanic when you cant cure it as Chaos, while all other factions can cure it.Anyways, wait till it is on a sale and Mortal/Immortal Empires or what it's called is ready.Also, why did they have to break the UI? Warhammer I and II and beutiful UIs now everything is this weird dark red color scheme that doesnt match the game.Oh and dont get me started on siege battles, sure they needed to get some form of a fix from Warhammer II. But this ♥♥♥♥ with constantly regenerating/rebuilding towers and weird Tower Defense like mechanics just does not work. Should be tossed in the bin, removes any sense of suspension and disbelief, cause the freaking Tower is back again 90 seconds later to shoot your troops in the back again, so it doesnt even make sense to use artillery against the towers, it is better used against the troops since you can only win by destroying troops really.

"2022 the first souls game I've ever played, currently 33 hours in and loving it",first soul game ive ever play current hour love
"At the moment the gameplay loop is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥For melee:- Chip damage is way to high with no tools of either preventing it, or replenishing health. (EDIT: A melee with ""fencing"" defence type has significantly reduced this problem)- The idea of trying to keep getting armour as if it was replenishing health just isn't a sound one. The chances to replenish it are rare, but on top of that armour has such little HP and therefore what you regain is insignificant and often immediately lost. - Parry is so odd. Not only have I found that holding the parry button delivers better results, but also a successful parry timing is done BEFORE the hit would land, unlike all other famous parry systems.This is not an inherently bad idea, I think it's quite novel and interesting. Especially with the imagery of a parry that is prepared for being better than a parry that is ""just in time"". However this utterly ♥♥♥♥♥ the bed against small enemies in hordes. There is no predicting in a horde, there are attacks all the time and when you see an enemy wind up and you prepare to parry, that parry is highjacked by a random enemy that you weren't prepared for, turning your Perfect Parry into the ♥♥♥♥ parry. This leads to you getting STUNLOCKED which is a cardinal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sin in games like these. Absolute wank. (EDIT: This is completely removed by using a ""Fencing"" defence type weapon. Using one removes the ""just in time"" parry and makes all successful parries the same *actual* parry. Although this makes the game much much more playable and fun and removes the stunlocking, I kinda liked the preparing idea and would like to see it delegated to rare and boss heavy attacks).Ranged:- Guns feel like ♥♥♥♥♥ in terms of damage. A Rubric Marine cannot tank 20 Bolt rounds to the face unless the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is named.- Ammo is rare as ♥♥♥♥ and because of the mentioned above, is absolutely useless as you burn right through it. I only don't feel this rarity when maining a melee class for obvious reasons.Misc:- What the everliving ♥♥♥♥ did they do to the Jump Pack in Operations? I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if I could fall out the map, just spawn me on top of a Player or NPC if that happens. There is no good reason to have neutered it so massively.- also why is customisation just kind of poor? I guess more will come later but just in what I'm able to change, SM1 was superior. Why can't I change lens colour or thigh armour colour? And the fact there is only Mark X ♥♥♥♥♥ me off. Give me my gorgeous Mk 7 helmet and please don't make me pay £10 for it.- The loading screens are abysmal and absurd. Sometimes it is faster to task manager the game out of existence than to sit through loading screens- EDIT: the new fencing weapons feel kind of OP? I know it sounds like I'm complaining that one of my problems mentioned above is now fixed, but I can now just spam-parry my way out of minor-hordes. Not very engaging, stimulating or cognitive.Fixes:- Either reduce the damage Minor enemies deal in melee (one Tzeench minion should not take a whole bar off my shield), OR increase shield HP (shield HP is decent in Mini-boss events like Helbrutes so if HP is raised, so should Helbrute's damage by slightly), OR increase shield regen from specific enemy executions. Rubric marines should not give 1 shield with how much damage they deal, OR increase the health recovery after taking damage lifespan. It goes away far to fast to actually act upon.- Have an more purposeful way to regain shield. I get nearly all of my Gun Strikes just unexpectedly, even though I'm always attempting to bash and stun enemies. Make bashing leading to a Gun Strike more consistent for minor enemies. - You should not have to use the Prepare Parry mechanic for minor enemies. Not only does it play like ♥♥♥♥, they just aren't strong strong enough to put a Space Marine on the back foot.- Buff the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Jump pack in Operations. It should go as far and be active as much as the campaign or PVP. ""Oh the slam, it would be too OP"" then nerf the slam damage dibshit.I'm going to keep playing this game every now and then in hopes that the higher class level experience is better, but it can't be a good game if I have to slog through ♥♥♥♥ for 25 hours just to get it to play nice.

"A Kaleidoscope Of FunOnce Human invites players into a world fraught with fear, where lifeless objects reanimate into hostile creatures intent on human extinction. Guided by an otherworldly figure, players must battle formidable boss-type enemies to edge closer to a prospective salvation, which remains uncertain. Amidst these dangers, bonds of friendship and camaraderie strengthen among the inhabitants. Forging new armors and weapons enhances survivability, erecting walls and defenses safeguards against threats, and collecting Deviations (the game’s equivalent of Pokémon) advances players into adept survivalists.GameplayThe core gameplay of Once Human revolves around survival-craft, with a primary focus on resource gathering. This aspect is well-balanced, avoiding an excessively grindy feel. Base building epitomizes this balance, as creating a fully furnished home requires only a few hours of resource gathering and planning.Crafting is efficient, with most recipes completing in seconds. Bulk crafting takes only a few minutes, providing time to manage the base or review character skills and stats. Various methods to expedite and increase the yield of crafting items cater to those with limited patience.Deviations, the game’s Pokémon-esque companions, are found through quests or at the end of boss levels. They serve various roles, from crafting and gathering resources to combat. Unlike its contemporary Palworld, which offers numerous companions, Once Human makes them rarer, enhancing their impact. Players are encouraged to experiment to find the Deviation that best suits their playstyle.Gunplay is satisfying, encouraging players to seek cover and capitalize on attack opportunities. While reminiscent of The Division, it is less complex. Combat includes a dodge-roll, frequently used in boss fights and player skirmishes. Smooth animations add weight to actions, showcasing the development team’s attention to detail.Quests are scattered throughout the world, with main quests guiding the narrative and side quests rewarding players with Deviations, experience points, and resources. Various world quests incite the server’s population to either collaborate or compete for victory and rewards. PvP enthusiasts will appreciate the forced-PvP high-value locations, akin to The Division’s “Dark Zone.”Areas for ImprovementAs a new game, Once Human has a few bugs, though none cause crashes. Visual glitches, such as weapons not appearing in hands or enemies teleporting when stuck in walls, are noticeable. These issues are likely to be addressed in future updates.While crafting is generally balanced, collecting wood takes longer relative to its usage. Converting wood to charcoal for smelting ores and crafting ammo depletes the resource quickly.The abundance of menus can be overwhelming, making navigation and reward claiming challenging. The game has much to offer but requires better visual organization. UI/UX improvements are essential to enhance the overall experience.SummaryIn conclusion, Once Human offers a kaleidoscope of engaging mechanics, presenting a visually stunning world with thrilling combat and survival elements. With a dedicated development team that values player feedback and respects players’ time, this game has strong potential to evolve into something exceptional. Embark on this immersive journey and uncover the true essence of survival.",kaleidoscop funonc human invit player world fraught fear lifeless object reanim hostil creatur intent human extinct guid otherworldli figur player must battl formid bosstyp enemi edg closer prospect salvat remain uncertain amidst danger bond friendship camaraderi strengthen among inhabit forg new armor weapon enhanc surviv erect wall defens safeguard threat collect deviat game equival pokmon advanc player adept survivalistsgameplayth core gameplay human revolv around survivalcraft primari focu resourc gather aspect wellbalanc avoid excess grindi feel base build epitom balanc creat fulli furnish home requir hour resourc gather planningcraft effici recip complet second bulk craft take minut provid time manag base review charact skill stat variou method expedit increas yield craft item cater limit patiencedevi game pokmonesqu companion found quest end boss level serv variou role craft gather resourc combat unlik contemporari palworld offer numer companion human make rarer enhanc impact player encourag experi find deviat best suit playstylegunplay satisfi encourag player seek cover capit attack opportun reminisc divis less complex combat includ dodgerol frequent use boss fight player skirmish smooth anim add weight action showcas develop team attent detailquest scatter throughout world main quest guid narr side quest reward player deviat experi point resourc variou world quest incit server popul either collabor compet victori reward pvp enthusiast appreci forcedpvp highvalu locat akin divis dark zonearea improvementa new game human bug though none caus crash visual glitch weapon appear hand enemi teleport stuck wall notic issu like address futur updateswhil craft gener balanc collect wood take longer rel usag convert wood charcoal smelt ore craft ammo deplet resourc quicklyth abund menu overwhelm make navig reward claim challeng game much offer requir better visual organ uiux improv essenti enhanc overal experiencesummaryin conclus human offer kaleidoscop engag mechan present visual stun world thrill combat surviv element dedic develop team valu player feedback respect player time game strong potenti evolv someth except embark immers journey uncov true essenc surviv

"2022 What can I say? Honestly I do not know how I can talk about this game in its current state, as I write this review I have played WH1, 2 and now 3 and honestly this game feels like early access, the unit mass is off, formations feels like they dont matter because Orgres spam, Demon Spam, Chariot spam and even BASIC infantry can just barge through your space marine kislevites and your halbardiers like a wet paper bag. Range units cant fire less than 10 degrees without moving the whole unit and by the way... they're a lot slower now as all infantry is.. oh and none of them can fire if ONE of them is caught on a twig (or another enemy unit in this case). And as I mentioned earlier, your big strong, anti-large infantry? yeah.. paper bag. (or in my experience, facing the wrong way because ONE Orgre, soul grinder or chariot decided to run decided to run through them and now the whole unit is being attacked from behind, shot at and targeted down because the archers looked tasty.) *This is one of MANY examples by the way, there is simply too many more for me to count*This is one issue I have noticed out of place, too many to even count, I have tried to watch Youtubers to see if I am going something wrong and I am not, simply the game is unbalanced, half finished and simply frustrating to play in its current state as it is full as bugs. (look at ElichTV and his Great Book of Bugs) So how do we fix this? oh lets release a multiplayer patch and then a patch for Alt Tab or something idk. What about fixing issues with the game? oh no lets just explain its very complicated to do. Okay so what will you do for the fans? Lets write a blog post fix some of the things early next month. This is not good enough for a AAA game studio, its honestly so saddening, disappointing and borderline infuriating.I'll just end it on this. Long story short I can go on and on and on about all the unbalanced autoresolve or paper bag infantry who are either killed too quickly or sent halfway across the map by my chariot to get back up again as an angry armoured bear and Co. smashing into you does nothing, but this game is not worth your money, wait for a discount or a decent patch in the next year or five. CA, if you ever read this, next time listen to your fans and the YOUTUBERS you USED to SELL YOUR BROKEN GAME and have THOUSANDS of hours in your games, as personally I believe they know more about what needs to change than what you do and the probability is, you can make MORE MONEY from it if thats all you truly care about as the game will be what the players want and not some broken, overpriced early access launch that you make up excuses for.

"2022 This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disgrace which is saying a lot even for a CA game. I've literally never written a review but this game....oh boy this game, I'll make an exception for.2 long legendary campaigns (140 hours at time of writing and thousands on total war games in general) ended abruptly when I couldn't teleport to the *SPOILER* forge of souls to intercept the enemy. I literally got the prompt to go there so I did, and waited there for 10+ turns. No battle option ever came up and upon one of my turns completing was given 'you've failed to intercept, campaign lost'. Like seriously? Didn't have the option with BOTH campaigns. This isn't even an isolated issue. Search up 'forge of souls issue' and it feels like no ones able to finish a campaign. How did this garbage get past playtesting? Not to mention the Tzeentch faction mechanic of just pausing all your movement for a turn. You know what makes warhammer suck in real life? Uninteractable 'gotchas' that require no skill and you can't do ♥♥♥♥ about them. With normal overworld you can at least assasinate/wound heroes that try to block your movement. This is just a random frustration feature that adds nothing to gameplay Why would you give this to the ai when its not being used by a player? How does this enhance or add to the strategic play of the game when it randomly stops all your strategic movement EVERY 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TURNS, how can you be so oblivious to such an obviously trash and frustrating feature?Everyone who tells you they like minor settlement battles hasn't played 100000 of them on every campaign that isn't on toddler difficulty. Too long, nonsensical, too frequent, and autoresolve just sucks (t5 garrisons 'decisive loss' vs t1 unit rebel blobs. In battle itself - I have no idea if this is intentional but it is still trash of a mechanic-your units response times are like a dial up internet connection to china in 1990. I sincerely hope this is a me incident but compared to other total warhammer games or even total war games in general your units have terrible response times to commands. This could be another attempt at a 'feature' that just ends up being frustration inducing.'realism' dictates a lag in executing orders after receiving them but this is still a game. I'm not looking to fight my own units to go forwards. Maybe its to make it harder to dodge magic but just feels like meaningless lag added to piss you off. Speaking of further pissing someone off, missile units are worse than ever with pathfinding. hundreds of times i've had them shoot something literally in front of them with no impediments and not only will they not fire but they'll just run straight into melee. Other TW games had this issue too but never to this extent. Its too the point where I don't even want to issue attack orders with a line of missile troops because its so hard to have them shoot to begin with without having to micro all of them to not charge into them when its an unimpeded sight line to the target. I was super excited to try out cathays close range rifles until I realized they never fired at your target unless they were autotargeting. Its like they took everything good about the other TW WH games and just made them suck. Oh not to mention unit formations means ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when even the ai just decides to pull entire units through your ranks or a shieldwall to touch your archers or artillery.With crap mechanics and unstable gameplay, I wouldn't touch this game until a couple years after launch and they remove the stupid mechanics they added. There are improvements to diplomacy like allegiance income and trading settlements, but fudnamentally, this game feels clunky, unresponsive, and is frustrating to play.Wait till patches fix everything.",game disgrac say lot even ca game ive liter never written review gameoh boy game ill make except long legendari campaign hour time write thousand total war game gener end abruptli couldnt teleport spoiler forg soul intercept enemi liter got prompt go wait turn battl option ever came upon one turn complet given youv fail intercept campaign lost like serious didnt option campaign isnt even isol issu search forg soul issu feel like one abl finish campaign garbag get past playtest mention tzeentch faction mechan paus movement turn know make warhamm suck real life uninteract gotcha requir skill cant normal overworld least assasinatewound hero tri block movement random frustrat featur add noth gameplay would give ai use player enhanc add strateg play game randomli stop strateg movement everi turn oblivi obvious trash frustrat featureeveryon tell like minor settlement battl hasnt play everi campaign isnt toddler difficulti long nonsens frequent autoresolv suck garrison decis loss vs unit rebel blob battl idea intent still trash mechanicyour unit respons time like dial internet connect china sincer hope incid compar total warhamm game even total war game gener unit terribl respons time command could anoth attempt featur end frustrat inducingr dictat lag execut order receiv still game im look fight unit go forward mayb make harder dodg magic feel like meaningless lag ad piss speak piss someon missil unit wors ever pathfind hundr time ive shoot someth liter front impedi fire theyll run straight mele tw game issu never extent point dont even want issu attack order line missil troop hard shoot begin without micro charg unimped sight line target super excit tri cathay close rang rifl realiz never fire target unless autotarget like took everyth good tw wh game made suck oh mention unit format mean even ai decid pull entir unit rank shieldwal touch archer artillerywith crap mechan unstabl gameplay wouldnt touch game coupl year launch remov stupid mechan ad improv diplomaci like allegi incom trade settlement fudnament game feel clunki unrespons frustrat playwait till patch fix everyth

For me, they nailed every aspect of what i love about the Souls titles and put it into an expansive and aesthetically gorgeous world. Being honest i cannot praise the visual and area design enough, it feels like Ds1 but larger and more grand. I personally hail Ds1's design as ""perfect"" as can be so take what i said as you will. As usual the music is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fantastic too. So so many new types of spells and incantations which open up many more interesting types of builds than we've had before. Ive personally planned a multitude of themed characters to play through both in PvP and PvE. The lore of Elden Ring is also superb and i think also the most accessible lore so far in a Fromsoft title. Also General Radahn is an absolute chad. My only criticisms of Elden Ring would be the copy pasted bosses as general enemies in late areas of the game or having 2x the boss for a boss fight. I personally feel like they're a crutch and also diminish earlier emotions of victory from beating a boss and 2x bosses in an area is, IMO, ""lazy"" Elden Ring is a BIG game, perhaps one of the largest ive ever played but to me everything about Elden Ring is big and grand and just absolutely deserves your attention.

และการดีไซน์ตัวศัตรูให้ดูน่ากลัวหลอน ๆ และท่วงท่าการโจมตีที่กะจังหวะหลบได้ยาก กลิ่นอายของ Soulslike ยังอยู่ในเกมนี้อย่างครบถ้วน หากจะเข้าไปฟันกันโต้ง ๆ คงได้กลับไปเกิดจุดเซฟรัว ๆ อย่างแน่นอน ดีกรีความยากต้องขอบอกว่าเล่นจนหัวร้อนถึงขั้นเปิดแอร์เบอร์ 25แล้วเอาพัดลมเป่าตัว เหงื่อถึงจะหยุดไหลกันเลยทีเดียว(เรื่องจริงนะ) และเกมนี้มีความยากระดับเดียวไม่มีตัวเลือกให้ปรับแต่งแต่อย่างใดอีกต่างหากซุนหงอคงคือตัวละครหลักที่เราจะได้เล่น มากับฉากเปิดตัวเต็มไปด้วยความตระการตา ทั้งฉากต่อสู้และเสียงเพลงประกอบ พลันให้ขนบนตัวลุกซู่ขึ้นมา พร้อมกับ Tutorial เล็ก ๆ น้อย ๆ ก่อนที่จะให้เราได้เริ่มเกมจริง ๆ โดยคอนเทนท์เกมในส่วนต่าง ๆ จะปลดล็อกออกไปตามเนื้อเรื่องทีละนิด ๆ เช่น การสร้างอาวุธ ชุดเกราะ การอัพสกิลทักษะ ยา หรือกระทั่งวิญญาณที่เรียกออกมาให้ช่วยสู้ด้านกราฟฟิคเนื่องจากผู้เขียนได้เกมฟรีจากการซื้อการ์ดจอของค่ายเขียวยี่ห้อ Galax 4070 แบบธรรมดา 12Gb ตัวเกมปรับกราฟฟิคเป็นสูงสุดมาให้อัตโนมัติตั้งแต่เข้าเกมมาและด้วยขุมพลังของ CPU Intel I7 10700 สามารถทำเฟรมเรทได้ที่ 55+ ไม่ต่ำไปกว่านี้ถือว่าค่อนข้างโอเค และรองรับ DLSS เต็มรูปแบบ การประมวลผลภาพที่ได้มาคือ “ขนลิงมันเป็นขนลิงเลยอะ” ขนเป็นขน เนียนกริ๊บ แสงเงา เท็กส์เจอร์ก้อนหิน ใบไม้ หรือเงาต่าง ๆ ถือว่าทำออกมาได้ดีมาก ส่วนปัญหาเรื่องกราฟฟิคมีเพียงช่วงเปลี่ยนฉากทิศทางแสงจะเปลี่ยนอย่างเห็นได้ชัดเจน อย่างเช่นอยู่ในถ้ำเราจะเห็นแดดนอกถ้ำทะแยงแสงมาจากฝั่งขวา แต่พอออกจากถ้ำแล้วมีการโหลดฉาก แสงก็เปลี่ยนทิศทางไปเป็นฝั่งซ้ายเฉยเลย...ก็มีบ้างเนื้อเรื่องตัวเกมทำออกมาได้เรียบง่าย เส้นทางค่อนข้างเป็นทางตรง มีทางแยกบ้าง แต่สุดท้ายก็จะไปบรรจบที่เดียวกัน ถึงจะดูเหมือนเส้นตรงก็จริงแต่ด้วยความที่เกมไม่ได้มอบมินิแมพหรือแผนที่มาให้เลย อาจทำให้มีหลงเส้นทางอยู่บ้างในช่วงเริ่มแรก แต่ก็มีคุณค่ามากพอแก่การเดินหลงสำรวจให้ครบถ้วน เพราะจะมีไอเทมหรือบอสลับอยู่มากมายรอคอยการเจอของคุณอยู่ เมื่อค้นพบหรือเอาชนะมันลงได้ อาจได้รับไอเทมที่ใช้ในการอัพเกรดของต่าง ๆ และสามารถนำไปอัพเกรดได้ที่ศาลเจ้าที่เปรียบเสมือนจุด Checkpoint และจุดเกิดซึ่งเรียงรายอยู่ตามทางได้ศัตรูเกมนี้จะมีออกมาตามทางให้เป็นระยะ ๆ ไม่ล้นเกร่อแบบเกมออนไลน์ทั่วไป อย่างจำพวกกี้ ๆ จะมาพอให้กรุ้มกริ่มเป็นการวอร์มอัพข้อมือข้อนิ้วก่อนจะไปเจอมินิบอสที่เรียงรายตามทางทุก ๆ 10-15นาที ฝีมือบางตัวร้ายการพอฟัดพอเหวี่ยง บางตัวปรากฏตัวอย่างอลังการขู่ขวัญเราด้วยขนาดตัวและกล้ามล่ำ ๆ แต่หากเราจับทริคมันได้จะง่ายขึ้นมาก บางตัวแทบไม่จำเป็นต้องใช้ยาเลย แต่แลกกับการตายซ้ำซากอยู่นานโขและอาจซื้อจอยอันใหม่มาแทนที่ หรืออย่างร้ายสุดคือตายจนจำบทพูดเย้ยหยันของบอสจนเอาไปพูดตามได้เลย (ฮา)ศัตรูแต่ละตัวหากเราฆ่าได้เป็นตัวแรกจะปลดล็อกเนื้อหาของมัน สามารถเข้าถึงเรื่องราวเกี่ยวกับศัตรูตัวนั้น และเมื่อพิชิตบอสประจำฉากได้จะมีอนิเมชั่นให้เราได้ดูเนื้อเรื่อง อีกทั้งสามารถดูแผนผังและคำบรรยายของภาพนั้นหลังจากจบฉากนั้นได้อีกด้วยการต่อสู้ในเกมนี้ทำได้ค่อนข้างสนุก กระชับ ชัดเจน ใช้โจมตีเบาเพื่อสะสมเกจพลังเพื่อโจมตีหนักใช้เป็นคอมโบต่อเนื่องหรือจะชาร์จเพื่อโจมตีหนักทีเดียวแบบหนักหน่วงก็ได้ตามสไตล์ของเรา ท่วงท่าการโจมตีมีให้ถึงสามแบบด้วยกัน ซึ่งแต่ละสกิลมีให้อัพแยกย่อยลงมาอีกมากมาย อีกทั้งทักษะแขนงอื่นอย่างทักษะติดตัว เพิ่มเลือด เพิ่มมานา หรือสเตมิน่า มาคอยให้เราเก็บเวลได้ติดงอมแงมแบบกู่ไม่กลับแน่นอน แต่ถ้าถามว่ามีข้อเสียไหมในระบบการต่อสู้เกมนี้ ต้องขอตอบว่ามี และเป็นข้อเสียขนาดใหญ่เสียด้วย(เป็นความคิดเห็นส่วนตัว) นั่นคือมุมกล้องที่ออกแบบมาได้แคบมาก และไม่มีตัวเลือกให้ปรับให้มุมมองกว้างขึ้นมาได้ อีกทั้งหากสู้ในที่แคบ ๆ มุมกล้องเราจะไม่ทะลุกำแพง นั่นหมายความว่ามุมมองเราจะถูกบีบให้ใกล้ตัวละครจนเห็นแต่หลังตัวละคร หรือบางครั้งการล็อกเป้าหมายโจมตีศัตรูที่ตัวเตี้ยกว่า มุมกล้องเราจะถูกกดให้ต่ำลง ส่งผลให้มองเห็นแค่พื้นในมุมมองที่แคบ หากเราถูกรุม เป็นเรื่องยากมากที่จะไม่เสียเลือดเสียเนื้อ นอกจากคนเล่นจะเป็นนิวไทป์น่ะนะ... และอีกข้อหนึ่งที่สำคัญ หากเราต้องการชาร์จโจมตีหนักที่ต้องกด Y (XBOX) หรือ ปุ่มสามเหลี่ยม(PS) โดยใช้นิ้วหัวแม่มือขวา จะทำให้เราเปลี่ยนมุมกล้องด้วยแกน แอนนาล็อกด้านไม่ได้หรือไม่ถนัดเลย ทำให้การชาร์จโจมตีหนักนั้น ก้านคอของตัวละครจะกลายเป็นอัมพาตทันทีเนื่องจากหันมุมกล้องแทบเป็นไปไม่ได้หรือได้แต่ยากมาก ๆ ซึ่งอาจต้องอาศัยนิ้วชี้ที่ไม่ถนัดเลยในการกดแทนที่พลาดไม่ได้คือระบบ Spell ที่บริโภคค่ามานาไว้คอยขัดจังหวะการโจมตีของศัตรูได้อย่างเห็นผลชะงักและพลิกให้ไพ่ของเราอยู่เหนือกว่าพวกมันได้เพียงอึดใจ ในตอนแรก Spell จะมีผลออกมาได้ไม่ค่อยดีนัก ซึ่งเราต้องอัพสกิลเพื่อให้มีประสิทธิภาพประสิทธิผลที่ดียิ่งขึ้น แต่ต้องแลกกับการไม่ได้อัพสกิลสายต่อสู้ แต่เกมค่อนข้างอิสระในการอัพพอสมควรเพื่อให้เข้ากับสไตล์การต่อสู้ของเราเอง แต่ใช่ว่ามาถึงจะอัพค่ามานา 5เลเวลแรกเลยนะ เดี๋ยวช่วงแรกจะไม่มีท่าคอมโบใช้สู้ใด ๆ เลยเด้อต่อมาก็เป็นระบบเครื่องสวมใส่ เกมนี้จะไม่ได้เป็นการสุ่มดรอปอย่างเกม Soulslike ทั่ว ๆ ไป แต่จะเป็นการคราฟท์แบบตายตัวเมื่อคุณพิชิตบอสได้สำเร็จ อาวุธและชุดเกราะใหม่ถึงจะถูกปลดล็อกมาให้คราฟท์ได้ ไอเทมคราฟท์หาได้ตามหีบในฉากที่ซ่อนอยู่ หรือบ้างก็ดรอปจากมอนสเตอร์หรือว่าพวกมินิบอสกับบอส ส่วน Will(ค่าเงินในเกม) จะได้จากการดูดวิญญาณสีเขียวเข้าน้ำเต้าจากการสังหารศัตรู (แอบเหมือนเกม Onimusha เหมือนกันแฮะ) โดยค่า Will จะใช้ในการซื้อไอเทมหรือใช่เป็นค่าอัพเกรดอาวุธชุดเกราะหรือวิญญาณที่ช่วยเราต่อสู้ได้อีกด้วย และด้วยวิธีการอัพเกรดที่ล็อกตายตัวของเกมนี้ ทำให้เราไม่ได้รู้สึกเก่งขึ้นเมื่อเจอบอสที่เก่งขึ้นตัวถัดไป เพียงแค่ไม่ได้ทำให้เรากระจอกลงเท่านั้นเอง ครั้นจะเก็บเลเวลให้สูง ๆ ไปสู้กับมันก็ใช้เวลานาน เพราะศัตรูอยู่กระจายไม่กระจุกซึ่งเสียเวลาโดยใช่เหตุ สรุปได้ว่าอย่างไรเสียเกมนี้ก็ต้องพึ่งฝีมือถึง 50%เลยทีเดียว 30% เป็นทักษะที่เราอัพ 10%เป็นไอเทมสวมใส่ และอีก10% ค่าน้ำเต้าเพิ่มพลังน้ำเต้าเพิ่มพลังเกมนี้มีลูกเล่นอยู่บ้างเล็กน้อย โดยเราสามารถเลือกรูปแบบน้ำเต้าให้มีออพชั่นเสริม หลังจากนั้นก็มีให้เลือกรูปแบบน้ำยาได้อีกว่าต้องการให้มีผลการฟื้นฟูเลือดอย่างไร สุดท้ายคล้าย ๆ กับเพิ่มลูกกลอนในตัวน้ำยาไว้เพิ่มบัฟหลังจากที่ดื่มน้ำเต้าไป การจะอัพเกรดได้จำเป็นต้องใช้ไอเทมเฉพาะมาอัพ มันจะเป็นผลเหลือง ๆ ของต้นไม้ที่มีศัตรูโหด ๆ เฝ้าแทบทุกต้นเลย เป็นการบอกกลาย ๆ ว่าถ้าอยากเก่งขึ้นคุณต้องเก่งกว่ามันให้ได้เสียก่อน นอกจากน้ำเต้าจะช่วยดูดวิญญาณศัตรูในเกมแล้ว ยังดูดวิญญาณเราให้คอยหาค่า Will มาอัพพวกนี้อีกด้วยสิเนี่ย(ให้ตายสิ)Spirit หรือวิญญาณจากศัตรูที่ได้จากการสังหารนั้น เราสามารถสวมใส่เพื่อเรียกใช้เป็นสกิลมาโจมตีศัตรูได้ เราจะได้ Spirit จากศัตรูพิเศษโดยสังเกตได้จากศัตรูที่ติดไฟสีฟ้ารอบตัวและจะเก่งกาจกว่าปกติเล็กน้อย แต่ละแบบจะมีเพียงตัวเดียวเท่านั้น ฉะนั้นเดินหาให้ทั่ว ๆ จะเป็นการดีที่สุด แต่หากคุณพลาด สามารถเดินทางกลับได้ตลอดเวลาด้วยศาลเจ้า และ Relic ที่ได้รับหลังจากชนะบอสประจำฉากจะสามารถเลือกความสามารถติดตัวได้ 1ข้อ จาก 1ใน3ข้อเสียของเกมคงไม่เหมาะสำหรับผู้เล่นที่ได้อัพสกิลแล้วรู้สึกว่าต้องสู้ได้ง่ายขึ้น สำหรับเกมนี้คืออัพสกิลแล้วสู้ไม่ง่ายขึ้น แต่สู้ได้ลื่นไหลขึ้น จังหวะต่อเนื่องมากขึ้นเท่านั้น ส่วนการอัพอาวุธและชุดเกราะไม่ค่อยหลากหลายสักเท่าไหร่ และออพชั่นเซ็ทบางชุดไม่ค่อยเห็นผลอย่างมีนัยยะสำคัญมากนัก และด้วยข้อนี้อาจจะไม่ค่อยมีแรงจูงใจในการให้เรารู้สึกอยากฟาร์มหาอาวุธหรือไอเทมอัพเกรดที่ทำให้รู้สึกสู้ได้ง่ายขึ้นเลย แต่ข้อด้อยนี้ก็ได้ถูกกลบลงไปด้วยเนื้อเรื่องที่น่าติดตามและสกิลที่ให้อัพค่อนข้างหลากหลาย หากไม่ซีเรียสเรื่องบัคแสงเงาบางฉาก และถ้าอยากฝึกแนว Sekiro เพื่อเพิ่มความนิ่งทางสภาวะจิตใจให้แนวแน่กับการลงแรงนิ้วกดปุ่มจอยเพื่อหลบหลีกอย่างสมบูรณ์แบบให้ดีขึ้น แต่ขณะเดียวกันก็ไม่อยากเสียค่า EPX เวลาตายแบบเกม Soulslike อื่น ๆ อย่าง Darksoul ต้องมานั่งวิ่งไล่เก็บศพอีก ก็ขอให้เกมนี้เป็นตัวเลือกแรก ๆ ในอ้อมกอดไว้ใน Steam เลย หรืออย่างน้อยเอาไปดองเกลือใน ID ไปก่อนก็ยังถือว่ากำไรชีวิตขอรับคะแนนความพึงพอใจส่วนตัวคือ 8/10 และเหตุผลที่หักคะแนนไป

"Product received for free I've finished the campaign and have a few more hours. I have some additional points I want to add while still maintaining my original points. I have friends to play with but a lot of the time I only have so much time or I just want to play alone. Steam having this in the single player category with the tag and, the promises of the devs to be able to progress solo caught my attention. Especially with this having a huge emphasis on co-op, that got me incredibly interested. That's the kind of basis I'd like to start with. Obviously these are just my points and opinions. Feel free to disagreeBad Points are:-SM2 has tried on every startup to install EOS. You can stop the installation if you'd like but I've read that it is tied and, essential to cross-platform play. It's an odd choice when most pc players (I think) will be on Steam based on the community consensus of Epic-Data Collection is on and required by default. You cannot disagree to the prompt in game. Lord knows what kind of data is actually being collected, as I'm sure is defined somewhere in the fine print like usual. This is plainly unacceptable.-Progression is tied to online services. I don't believe this applies to the campaign, I repeat this doesn't affect the campaign but, you won't be leveling up your classes while offline. I've seen a lot of people try to say based off of that, that this isn't a Live Service game. You will be wasting your time, you will not be progressing if you don't play online. Online services are a core part of this game. I absolutely hate Live Service games bc, one bad patch, one bad decision from the devs could potentially destroy the game and it's future. Helldivers 2 is a good example of being the biggest, best and fan favorite game of the year quickly turning into a very unenjoyable one. This Live Service model needs to go.-Playing solo is not possible while maintaining your online status in the Operations Gamemode. You're forced into a server, and to play with others. The devs stated it would be possible to play alone and make progress but, to my knowledge it isn't possible at this time. So if you're short on time, like to play casually, or just want to play alone, it will not be possible.-You cannot customize your Space Marine in the campaign or use classes. There are pre-applied skins that you can use with Titus in the campaign but to my knowledge the only skin I've seen, comes with the ultimate edition. Nor can you use classes in the campaign. The campaign will most likely be a sort of intro into the game and it's mechanics for most players and will be untouched after completion.-There is really not a lot of content to play through right now. You will get bored very quickly grinding the same missions repeatedly. Do expect more content in the future but I would wait a few months.-I personally do not care for the most of the classes, nor their abilities. I liked tactical and sniper but I cannot stand the equipment that you are limited to with some of the other classes. I didn't watch this game like a hawk as some did but, when I first picked it up, I didn't think the classes would be so neutered in what weapons they're able to equip. Especially after finishing the campaign, I felt extremely limited in my options.-The performance in my experience isn't terrible but it's extremely inconsistent. My GPU and CPU will jumping all over the place. My FPS never got over 60-65 no matter what settings I tried. I have an good pc and even then, I don't like running my system too hard. I couldn't find a nice middle ground between performance and visuals. Definitely going to need some smoothing out.-The melee combat is rough in my experience. The horrid key-binds make it worse but after remedying that, I found that hitting parry to the blue prompts, or dodging the red ones, half the time didn't register. There's always the possibility of human error here but it seems I am not the only one experiencing this.-As for the editions, there's only one other than the base edition that I even consider. If you'd like to get the season pass as well as some of the skins, I would recommend the Gold Edition but, the Ultimate Edition (UE) is plainly disappointing. Especially since the skins are not universal. Ex. Titus's skin from the UE can't be used in Operations or PvP. The only class-based skin you get is, I believe, for the heavy class only and, that can't be used in the campaign. You get three other skins I think for certain weapons but again, they're not universal so I can't exactly say it's worth it. Just do not buy the UE. It simply isn't worth it. I bought the Ultimate Edition for a hefty discount from another store. I'd advise looking into that if you still want the UE but $100, heck even the $90 Gold edition just to play the game early, get the season pass and, a few skins is not enough to justify that price tag. Absolutely outrageous. The Good Points are:-The game's performance isn't great but I didn't experience crashes like a lot of others did. I have crashed maybe once. There were times when I thought a bunch of stuttering would lead to more crashes but they didn't. I'm reading that some people can't get past the first cut scene... -The gunplay feels great. The variety between the guns not so much but the smooth reload animations and everything looks really good.-The graphics are beautiful. The devs really knocked it out of the park.-The Campaign's story although very short, is great. I am not very fluent in Warhammer lore so I can't say how it is lore wise but, I was happy with it.I have much more criticisms of this game than I have praise but, this review will turn to positive when the devs smooth out the performance, rebalancing the classes is a must IMO as some are quite bad. then to deliver on promises of playing solo for us solo players and the casuals. This is a typical game where the devs say it'll have features and, performance etc. just not at launch... give us a few weeks and then it'll be the game you were promised. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide but I would wait a few weeks... even months then check back in.",product receiv free ive finish campaign hour addit point want add still maintain origin point friend play lot time much time want play alon steam singl player categori tag promis dev abl progress solo caught attent especi huge emphasi coop got incred interest that kind basi id like start obvious point opinion feel free disagreebad point tri everi startup instal eo stop instal youd like ive read tie essenti crossplatform play odd choic pc player think steam base commun consensu epicdata collect requir default disagre prompt game lord know kind data actual collect im sure defin somewher fine print like usual plainli unacceptableprogress tie onlin servic dont believ appli campaign repeat doesnt affect campaign wont level class offlin ive seen lot peopl tri say base isnt live servic game wast time progress dont play onlin onlin servic core part game absolut hate live servic game bc one bad patch one bad decis dev could potenti destroy game futur helldiv good exampl biggest best fan favorit game year quickli turn unenjoy one live servic model need goplay solo possibl maintain onlin statu oper gamemod your forc server play other dev state would possibl play alon make progress knowledg isnt possibl time your short time like play casual want play alon possibley custom space marin campaign use class preappli skin use titu campaign knowledg skin ive seen come ultim edit use class campaign campaign like sort intro game mechan player untouch completionther realli lot content play right get bore quickli grind mission repeatedli expect content futur would wait monthsi person care class abil like tactic sniper stand equip limit class didnt watch game like hawk first pick didnt think class would neuter weapon theyr abl equip especi finish campaign felt extrem limit optionsth perform experi isnt terribl extrem inconsist gpu cpu jump place fp never got matter set tri good pc even dont like run system hard couldnt find nice middl ground perform visual definit go need smooth outth mele combat rough experi horrid keybind make wors remedi found hit parri blue prompt dodg red one half time didnt regist there alway possibl human error seem one experienc thisa edit there one base edit even consid youd like get season pass well skin would recommend gold edit ultim edit ue plainli disappoint especi sinc skin univers ex tituss skin ue cant use oper pvp classbas skin get believ heavi class cant use campaign get three skin think certain weapon theyr univers cant exactli say worth buy ue simpli isnt worth bought ultim edit hefti discount anoth store id advis look still want ue heck even gold edit play game earli get season pass skin enough justifi price tag absolut outrag good point areth game perform isnt great didnt experi crash like lot other crash mayb time thought bunch stutter would lead crash didnt im read peopl cant get past first cut scene gunplay feel great varieti gun much smooth reload anim everyth look realli goodth graphic beauti dev realli knock parkth campaign stori although short great fluent warhamm lore cant say lore wise happi iti much critic game prais review turn posit dev smooth perform rebalanc class must imo quit bad deliv promis play solo us solo player casual typic game dev say itll featur perform etc launch give us week itll game promis ultim decid would wait week even month check back
"2022 UPDATE 2.1 The very first patch after the second part of the game dropped a few days ago, and guess what, did they use that update to fix bugs, there are still bugs that have been in this game since warhammer 2. So they ignored all of those and focused on ""FIXING"" ppl playing the game in a way CA didn't like, were they having fun yes, did CA like that, no. Everything about Immortal empires that is fun, is stuff that was fun in warhammer 2, everything that is bad, broken or bugged is stuff that shoved in for warhammer 3. Magic and the buff that improve magic that heroes have just don't work at all, but oh no ppl are using the only spells that are working well! Got to nerf those, while 90% of magic is trash or broken. The choice of what they are focusing on, really makes me sad. I loved warhammer 2 but this game and all the bad choices as well as how they keep draining the fun out of the game. They limit the play styles, file of the edges of the A-symmetry that made this game better then any other total war, that made the races feel so different and fun to play. I played warhammer 2 nonstop for years, and I don't think I can even played for another 2 weeks of warhammer 3, these patches and dlc are so depressing and lacking. I took a break after playing for 2 weeks after launch because of how bad it was, came back and tried mods to fix some of the game, but it wasn't enough, so i waited for immortal empires. I don't have to deal with that crappy game design that they put in for warhammer 3, I can just play the races form warhammer 2 but nope, they hit them all with that same stick. LIKE REALLY maybe these new ideas that you are bringing to warhammer 3 ARE BAD and maybe ppl just wanted warhammer 2 with some new races and some quality of life tweeks and some actual bug fixes, not this, not feeling sad as every single race, has had big chunks carved out of it by a dev team that doesn't even know what made warhammer 2 good and warhammer 3 bad, and who still haven't learned that lesson going of what they prioritised in the patch.... 2 week after launch: This is ROME 2 with all the bugs and all the heartless cash grab, nice to see CA hasn't changed one bit. Still willing to use and abuse its fans. Never trust CA, every time it looks like they are getting better, they drop a buggy unfinished mess on the fans, with an uncaring smile an their faces. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. wait 2 years and a steep discount if you really want it. Maybe you might get a complete game, at least you got it for cheap. I've played ever faction, and most of the time, towards the end, its just hitting turn end, with allies on every boarder. You can't be at TOTAL WAR, nope you best army and best leader has to nope out every 25 turns, so enjoy your total board game just like CA designed it to be. This game feels like a hate letter from CA to every total war fan.",updat first patch second part game drop day ago guess use updat fix bug still bug game sinc warhamm ignor focus fix ppl play game way ca didnt like fun ye ca like everyth immort empir fun stuff fun warhamm everyth bad broken bug stuff shove warhamm magic buff improv magic hero dont work oh ppl use spell work well got nerf magic trash broken choic focus realli make sad love warhamm game bad choic well keep drain fun game limit play style file edg asymmetri made game better total war made race feel differ fun play play warhamm nonstop year dont think even play anoth week warhamm patch dlc depress lack took break play week launch bad came back tri mod fix game wasnt enough wait immort empir dont deal crappi game design put warhamm play race form warhamm nope hit stick like realli mayb new idea bring warhamm bad mayb ppl want warhamm new race qualiti life tweek actual bug fix feel sad everi singl race big chunk carv dev team doesnt even know made warhamm good warhamm bad still havent learn lesson go prioritis patch week launch rome bug heartless cash grab nice see ca hasnt chang one bit still will use abus fan never trust ca everi time look like get better drop buggi unfinish mess fan uncar smile face buy game wait year steep discount realli want mayb might get complet game least got cheap ive play ever faction time toward end hit turn end alli everi boarder cant total war nope best armi best leader nope everi turn enjoy total board game like ca design game feel like hate letter ca everi total war fan
"2022 This is one of the best games ever made.but some GRIPESi havFromSoftware's Dark Souls 4 is the 7th game in the Dark Souls series and is like Dark Souls 3 but you fight each boss 5 times and they're all like Dark Souls 1's Manus fight but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Its less about dodging and hitting at the right time, and more about using the mimic tear to tank the 50 unblockable attacks, and then spamming spells from far away.It wants you to use many different means to defeat enemies. its a shame then that when you find out what works isnt very fun or challenging. Using the new mechanics often feels like a crutch for the difficulty rather than being a challenge. ""In our games specifically, hardship is what gives meaning to the experience."" - miyazakithe hardship in this game is the challenge you put upon yourself, as what you use determines the difficulty.i think this is how the game is meant to be played, exploring an open world to get more OP stuff to make the fights easier.FromSock has a formula that never fails, and this is no different... it has all the great parts from the other games but in an often unbalanced and unnecessary open worldelden bing 4/5",one best game ever madebut gripesi havfromsoftwar dark soul game dark soul seri like dark soul fight boss time theyr like dark soul manu fight less dodg hit right time use mimic tear tank unblock attack spam spell far awayit want use mani differ mean defeat enemi shame find work isnt fun challeng use new mechan often feel like crutch difficulti rather challeng game specif hardship give mean experi miyazakith hardship game challeng put upon use determin difficultyi think game meant play explor open world get op stuff make fight easierfromsock formula never fail differ great part game often unbalanc unnecessari open worldelden bing

"*no spoilers* I'm at the end of the third act now, but I can already say with confidence it is one of the best games released in recent years. Great graphics and detailed environment, interesting combat system with different combat stances, skills tree, crafting, fascinating setting, story and awesome cutscenes. I found the game quite challenging, but once you start to understand the combat system, it becomes much easier. In the beginning the game seems very linear with nothing to do, but closer to the 2nd act things change a lot. Locations are getting a lot bigger and more interesting. The game highly encourages exploration of locations and there is a lot of hidden content, different side quests, optional bosses and such, even sometimes very useful game mechanics are hidden behind side quests (the hub with the blacksmith). It's not dark souls or elden ring, but something closer to sekiro + god of war, it feels like the whole game is made up of fights with bosses, but they don't feel like just an asset flip, most of them have unique visuals and move sets. Game is worth its money, the developers have done a very good job, and such games should be supported. Definitely recommend it, 10/10.",spoiler im end third act alreadi say confid one best game releas recent year great graphic detail environ interest combat system differ combat stanc skill tree craft fascin set stori awesom cutscen found game quit challeng start understand combat system becom much easier begin game seem linear noth closer act thing chang lot locat get lot bigger interest game highli encourag explor locat lot hidden content differ side quest option boss even sometim use game mechan hidden behind side quest hub blacksmith dark soul elden ring someth closer sekiro god war feel like whole game made fight boss dont feel like asset flip uniqu visual move set game worth money develop done good job game support definit recommend

"2022 This is probably the best game I've played in literal years, not only that, but it's probably one of the best games I've ever played in my life. It's the amalgamation of practically all the previous Fromsoft/Souls games, every feature, every design, every skill they've honed over the course of years making these games, put into a gigantic and incredibly immersive world where you're constantly being rewarded for adventuring out on your own. I think it's pretty safe to say that we just don't get games like this anymore, especially without a flood of micro-transactions and other ""pay for convenience"" abominations that have plagued games the last 8 years. This is just a good ass game, full stop. It's one of those games that not only lived up to to hype, but somehow managed to exceed it in a lot of ways.",probabl best game ive play liter year probabl one best game ive ever play life amalgam practic previou fromsoftsoul game everi featur everi design everi skill theyv hone cours year make game put gigant incred immers world your constantli reward adventur think pretti safe say dont get game like anymor especi without flood microtransact pay conveni abomin plagu game last year good ass game full stop one game live hype somehow manag exceed lot way

"You block/roll a string of 12 attacks with the bosses flailing and jumping and flipping and breaking your target lock, you see they've probably finished their string and try to get in one R1, but little did you know there was an unreactable delayed AOE explosion at the end of the string to punish your attempt to get the tiniest bit of damage. Or maybe they fling their sword up in the air for twelve seconds and catch you rolling with some absurd, clearly-designed-to-♥♥♥♥-with-you delay. Which boss did I just describe? Most of them. The only advancement to your moveset in this game from Souls is the ability to jump, and almost no enemies use that as a mechanic. Every weapon art that isn't bloodhound step or raptor is virtually useless against the bosses. Torrent isn't available for bosses often enough, and is often straight up worse than being on foot. You don't get to do anything cool, the boss just does all the cool ♥♥♥♥ to you. These bosses would be way more fun in a game that expands what your character is capable of, like Sekiro, Nioh, or Monhun. I've beaten the game four times, and just finished the DLC. I'm not bad at the game. They've just cranked up boss health bars and damage and movesets to an absurd degree, and left the player character with the same roll, block and attack they've been using since Demon's Souls.Now that I'm done with the DLC, I'll probably never boot up and replay this game ever again, which is a shame.

"This game is very promising. However, in it's current state I simply cannot recommend it. The mechanics are awesome, the combat is great but there are some issues I would like to address. I'll make it simple.PROS:-Visually great.-Good Audio.-Engaging crafting and resource gathering.-Creative story and enemies.-Seamless co-op play.-Large map.-Base Building and resource management.-Combat is fun and intuitive.CONS:-Horrible Network Issues.-Lag and desync even on the closest servers.-Janky combat due to desync issues.-Korean servers offer better connection than NA servers. (I don't know why)-Low ping does not equal steady connection.-Player animations like resource gathering is buggy. I.E chopping down trees and mining ore will not show properly, Your equipped weapon will default as the pickaxe.-Game wipes every six weeks leaving casual players and those who work feeling left out. -Screen tearing when looking at sky. (Only sometimes)Conclusion: Although the game has it's issues it shows promise for the future. Many of the issues I addressed can be fixed with updates and most likely will. However, the lag and desync will take most of the joy out of your experience. I wanted to continue to play but could not get myself to overlook this issue. It seems like you can manage it until you go to fight enemies and than it really becomes annoying. The elephant in the room must be addressed. Why make your game wipe in six weeks? I understand that PvP might need that to avoid new players being discouraged, I would still like to think that it is to early. The game has a very solid foundation, but these issues need to be addressed.",game promis howev current state simpli recommend mechan awesom combat great issu would like address ill make simpleprosvisu greatgood audioengag craft resourc gatheringcr stori enemiesseamless coop playlarg mapbas build resourc managementcombat fun intuitiveconshorr network issueslag desync even closest serversjanki combat due desync issueskorean server offer better connect na server dont know whylow ping equal steadi connectionplay anim like resourc gather buggi ie chop tree mine ore show properli equip weapon default pickaxegam wipe everi six week leav casual player work feel left screen tear look sky sometimesconclus although game issu show promis futur mani issu address fix updat like howev lag desync take joy experi want continu play could get overlook issu seem like manag go fight enemi realli becom annoy eleph room must address make game wipe six week understand pvp might need avoid new player discourag would still like think earli game solid foundat issu need address

"Elden Ring Every review is subjective and aligns with the perception, tastes, and/or interests of the person writing it. I’m someone who views video games as another form of artistic expression, which is why I do NOT assign a score. I don't believe art can be measured or quantified. I’ll simply share my personal experience while avoiding spoilers as much as possible. Elden Ring is essentially a culmination of everything FromSoftware has refined over the years in their previous titles, wrapped in a vast open world that invites exploration and discovery. If I could describe Elden Ring in one word, it would be ""Lost."" Like other FromSoftware games, this one is filled with moments where you’re not entirely sure what you’re doing, who the enemies are that you’re fighting, why they’re there, where you should go, or what the correct path is. Yet, that sense of being lost isn’t frustrating; it’s a driving force that pushes you to keep going. There’s something magnetic that urges you to press forward, to explore every corner of the map in search of an NPC, an item, or any clue that might give you some direction. But as you progress, things only become more convoluted. When you finally defeat an enemy, a tougher one appears. When you think you’ve grasped a part of the lore, new information emerges that forces you to rethink everything. The game constantly keeps you in a state of uncertainty, wondering whether you’ve taken the right path or strayed into a dangerous detour.The only clear indicators of progress in Elden Ring are the boss fights, a few scattered dialogues, and some of the graces placed across the map. The sense of accomplishment from defeating a boss is unparalleled, it serves as a reminder that despite the confusion and challenges, you are making progress.One of the standout aspects of Elden Ring is the sheer size and richness of its world. In open-world games, I’ve always enjoyed exploring every last corner of each zone, and this title was no exception. The world’s vastness, both visually and in terms of content, is impressive. The thrill of discovering a new area or finding a well-hidden secret is what drives me to keep playing. However, as I explored, I encountered one of the game’s most criticized aspects: repeated bosses. While it’s a common practice in some games, I expected FromSoftware to maintain their unique touch of originality. Perhaps the decision to reuse bosses was driven by the ambition to make the world as large as possible in their first attempt at an open-world game. Personally, I wouldn’t mind it as much if these bosses became increasingly challenging or had new attack patterns, but in most cases, the fights feel nearly identical. Despite this shortcoming, the overall experience wasn’t “tarnished” (xD), I thoroughly enjoyed every battle, striving to improve with each encounter. Erdtree The Erdtree expansion brings new mechanics and a narrative focus that complements the base experience of Elden Ring. When I first accessed the expansion, I thought it would be similar to the DLCs in the studio’s other games: having a high level would be enough… I was wrong. Erdtree introduces a unique mechanic that intertwines with the game’s lore. If you choose to ignore that detail, be prepared to suffer like never before. What’s fascinating is how this expansion not only adds content but also manages to maintain the essence of what makes Elden Ring special while expanding its world in a way that feels natural. Despite all the new content, both Elden Ring and Erdtree are, in my opinion, the most accessible and, to some extent, the easiest experiences FromSoftware has developed. That’s not to say they lack challenge, but the open-world design, with its emphasis on exploration and freedom, somewhat softens the experience.In conclusion, I can confidently say that Elden Ring is the best game they’ve created in terms of ambition, design, and execution. However, interestingly, it’s not my favorite. Despite everything I’ve mentioned, I don’t feel the desire to replay it, cause it feels like a one-time experience. This contrasts with Bloodborne, my favorite game from the studio, which I could play over and over again. Despite being technically inferior in several ways, Bloodborne has an atmosphere and design that I find more appealing and invites me to a better ""dream"".",elden ring everi review subject align percept tast andor interest person write im someon view video game anoth form artist express assign score dont believ art measur quantifi ill simpli share person experi avoid spoiler much possibl elden ring essenti culmin everyth fromsoftwar refin year previou titl wrap vast open world invit explor discoveri could describ elden ring one word would lost like fromsoftwar game one fill moment your entir sure your enemi your fight theyr go correct path yet sens lost isnt frustrat drive forc push keep go there someth magnet urg press forward explor everi corner map search npc item clue might give direct progress thing becom convolut final defeat enemi tougher one appear think youv grasp part lore new inform emerg forc rethink everyth game constantli keep state uncertainti wonder whether youv taken right path stray danger detourth clear indic progress elden ring boss fight scatter dialogu grace place across map sens accomplish defeat boss unparallel serv remind despit confus challeng make progresson standout aspect elden ring sheer size rich world openworld game ive alway enjoy explor everi last corner zone titl except world vast visual term content impress thrill discov new area find wellhidden secret drive keep play howev explor encount one game critic aspect repeat boss common practic game expect fromsoftwar maintain uniqu touch origin perhap decis reus boss driven ambit make world larg possibl first attempt openworld game person wouldnt mind much boss becam increasingli challeng new attack pattern case fight feel nearli ident despit shortcom overal experi wasnt tarnish xd thoroughli enjoy everi battl strive improv encount erdtre erdtre expans bring new mechan narr focu complement base experi elden ring first access expans thought would similar dlc studio game high level would enough wrong erdtre introduc uniqu mechan intertwin game lore choos ignor detail prepar suffer like never what fascin expans add content also manag maintain essenc make elden ring special expand world way feel natur despit new content elden ring erdtre opinion access extent easiest experi fromsoftwar develop that say lack challeng openworld design emphasi explor freedom somewhat soften experiencein conclus confid say elden ring best game theyv creat term ambit design execut howev interestingli favorit despit everyth ive mention dont feel desir replay caus feel like onetim experi contrast bloodborn favorit game studio could play despit technic inferior sever way bloodborn atmospher design find appeal invit better dream
"2022 I have been a fan of Total War games since Shogun 1 and have particularly enjoyed Total Warhammer 1 & 2. Unfortunately, this is just really, really disappointing.I'm not quite sure what they were thinking with the changes they made because almost all the changes are for the worse compared to WH2.The new settlement towers and barricades? Pure cancer. The towers in particular are utterly unbalanced and make every battle a slog. I say every battle rather than just ""siege battles"" because the AI absolutely refuse to fight you on the open field unless they outnumber you hugely. I've had three open field battles in 6 hours of play. Big, fun set-piece battles are meant to be the centrepiece of this game and this one fails at it's most fundamental level.The new mechanic where rifts into chaos randomly appear in your territories every turn? One of the most annoying mechanics they could have devised. Not only is there no way to prevent this but they take your provinces from 0 to 100 corruption in three turns, discourge enemy agents into your lands and often enemy armies. This means that the only viable tactic is to turtle and spam end turn since, if you expand, you cannot protect your provinces properly.The game economy is broken. This makes having more than one army nearly impossible (especially due to the necessary turtling) and good luck saving enough money to get decent settlements unless you farm Slaanesh's rewards.Does it have good AI? LOLNO, all AI factions at war will make a beeline for the player no matter how stupid it is to do so. This has always been an issue but it's so much worse in WH3. The AI also outright and blatantly cheats in respect of the main quest (you can watch it do so in front of your eyes) but, even worse, if they collect all the souls before you that is an instant game over and there is no option to buy more time by defeating them in battle.The UI? Far inferior to the WH2 one.Optimisation? It runs like a legless paraplegic on a floor made of needles. Look forward to constant graphical glitches and stuttering.Bugs? Quite a few game breaking ones but you'll only find out after having wasted several hours on a campaign.I am going to have to ditch the game until the big combined map comes out or until there is mod support to get rid of the many, many issues because the gameplay is actively anti-fun at present and that is coming from someone who actually quite liked the Vortex campaign in WH2 (which a lot of people complained about).Very sadly, this is the first TW game that I simply cannot recommend. Hopefully they'll fix some of this in patches but I suspect that much of it is unfixable because it represents inexplicable design decisions which would need to be redesigned from the ground up. Regardless, I'll keep an open mind and I hope that I can change this review to a positive at a later date.",fan total war game sinc shogun particularli enjoy total warhamm unfortun realli realli disappointingim quit sure think chang made almost chang wors compar new settlement tower barricad pure cancer tower particular utterli unbalanc make everi battl slog say everi battl rather sieg battl ai absolut refus fight open field unless outnumb huge ive three open field battl hour play big fun setpiec battl meant centrepiec game one fail fundament levelth new mechan rift chao randomli appear territori everi turn one annoy mechan could devis way prevent take provinc corrupt three turn discourg enemi agent land often enemi armi mean viabl tactic turtl spam end turn sinc expand protect provinc properlyth game economi broken make one armi nearli imposs especi due necessari turtl good luck save enough money get decent settlement unless farm slaanesh rewardsdo good ai lolno ai faction war make beelin player matter stupid alway issu much wors ai also outright blatantli cheat respect main quest watch front eye even wors collect soul instant game option buy time defeat battleth ui far inferior oneoptimis run like legless parapleg floor made needl look forward constant graphic glitch stutteringbug quit game break one youll find wast sever hour campaigni go ditch game big combin map come mod support get rid mani mani issu gameplay activ antifun present come someon actual quit like vortex campaign lot peopl complain aboutveri sadli first tw game simpli recommend hope theyll fix patch suspect much unfix repres inexplic design decis would need redesign ground regardless ill keep open mind hope chang review posit later date

Picture this: legions of developers hunched over their screens, burning the midnight oil to crank out .. a sequel. A mirage of innovation.

Face reality, you're not an investor.. you're a gambler and the house always wins.The players are a motley crew of keyboard warriors, so embroiled in their virtual skirmishes that they've forgotten the taste of fresh air. It's a circus, and not the kind with clowns and cotton candy.

"2021 From the moment I first partook in this illicit, nefarious substance known as Counter Strike, I was initially distraught, disillusioned with life, with my inner hope in humanity dimming immensely. Ever since my first interaction with another in this accursed contraption, which devolved into envisioning him preaching support for some form of radical ideology, I became wary of its inhabitants, initially deeming them all as rabid, saliva frothing fiends, that were effectively released primates, which insidious Saes scientists had abducted and connected to a computer. Overtime, my original derisive demeanour towards the inhabitants of Counter Strike gradually altered, I began to view them in an utterly inconceivable way, I began to regard them as humans. Perhaps it was a form of Stockholm Syndrome infiltrating and ultimately subverting my senses, but after witnessing such these creatures antics, I began to comprehensively analyse their bewildering personality arcs and acknowledged their intricate quirks and demeanours, that varied depending on the individual. It was through meticulous, deductive investigation that I gleaned a hierarchy of sorts, a selective system of power that presides within Counter Strike. It appeared these peculiar anomalies had an unspoken agreement of those who commandeered respect and were designated to obey within a server. To state it in a simplistic manner, the realm of Counter Strike bears four classes, each one wielding a distinctive set of attributes and a varying degree of influence. These classes can be located in any typical server, with the four social castes being simplistically defined as ‘foreigner’, ‘child’, ‘female’ and ‘adult’. Presiding within the upper hierarchy, lies the adults, a term defining a loose collective of individuals with varying degrees of deep, masculine voices, that emanate through their pristine, gold plated microphones and are projected onto any server they come across. Typically, the adult branch bears two subsects, entities with slight feminine lisps, that are accentuated by their inability to pronounce various vowels, with the other branch being zealous nationalists, who presume that they are Oswald Mosley himself, bellowing their political idealogue to a blackshirt rally. The first subsect, who for conveniences sake we shall refer to as the men of Sodom, are often envisioned preaching compassion and tolerance in games, all the while simultaneously attempting to solicit nude imagery from the children or female social caste, seeking to beguile them forth by demonstrating their aiming prowess. Contrary to the men of Sodom, the nationalists are frequently observed preaching distinctive political ideologues, all the while bellowing racial slurs and preying upon the conspicuous susceptibilities to all who are not swayed to their cause. At times, as featured by droves of Jesus Bots and individuals masquerading as George Floyd, the nationalists endeavour to bolster their forces and as such go on mass recruitment runs, dedicated to converting any with a fragment of intrigue to their zealous cause. Due to the conflicting demeanours and philosophy between the men of Sodom and the nationalists, they are routinely envisioned warring within many a game, attempting to gain a remnant of ground and control in their perpetual, tenacious struggle. Asides from the adult sect, lies the female branch. This branch is generally regarded by the most renowned of philosophers as the second most integral and influential organisation presiding within Counter Strike. Frequently this group of temptresses utilises their feminine voices to beguile any they come across, often being able to captivate a throng of admirers, who will defend their seductress to their last breath. Often this group demonstrates antipathy towards the foreigner subsect, as they cannot comprehend feminine voices and thus are not swayed, alongside the nationalists who attempt to purposedly anger the female caste, as a way of acquiring newfound combatants from their admirers. Based on the females ability in serenading a sirens tune, it would be prudent to be wary of this potent caste. Fortunately, as a result of mass cullings stemming from the nationalists and rampant abductions, derived from lustful children and men of Sodom, the females ranks have significantly decreased, making them a sparse and prized commodity in the Savannah of Counter Strike. Measuring at the second lowest slot of the social caste, lies the children, the youth of Counter Strike. Frequently, as a result of their nasally, high pitched, helium induced voices, equip with petulant demeanours, they are subject to much ridicule, mockeries that often revolve around the children being verbally beaten into submission from both subsects of the adult caste, alongside the females. Lastly, residing within the lowest social caste, features the cheap, unskilled labour of Counter Strike, the foreigners. This caste comes in all ranges, Asian, Russian, Spanish and many others. Frequently, as they incessantly gibber away in their own dialect, they are insulted from all corners, particularly the nationalists, who attempt to provoke the slumbering, indefinite horde. Any provocation or obscenity hurled in this castes direction often bears a minimal effect, as the foreigner is unable to comprehend the English tongue, instead being content in incessantly sprouting their gibberish, oblivious to the hostility they are beset by. Regarding the social castes, it can be stated that they remain a vicious and conspicuous feature of the realm of Counter Strike, with each social sector roving around servers, attempting to emulate 1920’s Birmingham gangs, as they extort and intimidate rivals into complete and utter compliance. Ever since acquiring a travel ticket and touring throughout this backwater fiefdom, I have developed an epiphany, a realisation of sorts. I have gleaned that nothing procures more joy in my life, than hearing the anguished cries of prepubescent youth, equip with the smacks of batons and boisterous snarls of adults as they yell every obscenity that exists within the grand tome of grudges at all forms of denizens that reside within. What else provides an inexplicable happiness is observing Asians of ambiguous ethnicity being slurred at by intoxicated patriots, who envision themselves at the glorified border guards of Counter Strike, critically acclaimed sentinels who will strive at nothing more than to fulfil their oath in purging all undesirables from their rural border town.

"The scenery and gameplay—great.However, this game suffers from poor design choices in online play. Matchmaking is terrible. Sometimes you connect to an operation already in progress. Other times, the game decides you're going to be the host and keeps you waiting. Wanna roll again? Quit to title screen and try again. You can spend a long time loading in, only to find out that the class you wanted to play has already been taken by someone else—or worse, both of your preferred classes are taken. Suddenly, you can't do that ruthless run you signed up for because your other classes aren't leveled up. So back to Battle Barge, roll again, load again... and then randomly disconnects without any easy way of connecting to operation. This game waste a lot of your time.I'm not sure how obvious these issues were to the designers, but they really should have considered them. You waste a lot of time just waiting and searching for a match to play.",sceneri gameplaygreathowev game suffer poor design choic onlin play matchmak terribl sometim connect oper alreadi progress time game decid your go host keep wait wan na roll quit titl screen tri spend long time load find class want play alreadi taken someon elseor wors prefer class taken suddenli cant ruthless run sign class arent level back battl barg roll load randomli disconnect without easi way connect oper game wast lot timeim sure obviou issu design realli consid wast lot time wait search match play

"Finally.....some good f_cking food.... (c) - Gordon RamsayAfter years and years AND YEARS of really bad Warhammer games...after THQ left us to suffer with failures like Eisenhorn, various Turn Based cringe games, indie games, Fantasy games, DOW 3 - let Emperor make me forget about that - and god knows what elseWe finally got it - a fine successor to good Warhammer games and also a sequel to a game from 2011Lots of bugs are flying by in search for some food - and also heretics doing funny stuff🟡The plot of this game is pretty much the same as SM1 - but instead of Orks - you fight Nids, brutally. Very. Brutally.After some time - there's gonna be Chaos Marines - Thousand Sons to be exact.Also lots of nods to the previous game and overall - this game is way more serious and lore accurate than SM1 - for better or worse. With occasional lore errors here and there but its okay.🟡But tbh - the plot remains kinda boring until the very end.When you'll get to the 3-rd planet, story finally starts to become fun and entertaining so there's that.Barely optimized horde game🟡I was not expecting much for 50 bucks - and to be fair, the game look - not exactly spectacular. The most weaker parts of the game - are faces and cutscenes on game engineCGIs look great, models and animations too, hi-res textures, decent effects - but nothing moreThe game is like from 2020-2022 🔴And yet if you want to run it properly - you better have a pretty damn good rig from 2024 or else its gonna be a bad time.I'd actually suggest to play this game on PS5 because on PC....In short, Im glad I can run it in 40 FPS with my RIG, but I heard dudes on better hardware cant even render the game properly and have even worse FPSes which is weirdAnd oh boy, I hope you're prepared for Ripper rooms and Big Waves🟢Although I REALLY like Tyranids models in this game🔴Finally, there are some funny bugs here and there. Mostly just broken animationsAlthough there was one critical bug - a random joined me in coop mission when I was pressing a certain button to blow a bridge - I stuck on this button - and noclipped through air to the edge of the map..............A game about shooting, slashing and shooting some more🟡3 player coop game. mostly. You can play campaign with friends only (or solo but its harder on highet difficulties)Campaign is about 6-10 hours, depending on how well you play and if you look for collectibles/care for achivos.There's also 6 coop missions with randomsPVP mode with 3 maps, 3 modes where 6 players fight other 6 players - pretty dull.🟢The gameplay itself - a pretty basic 3-rd person shooter with basic combo mechanics. You can also parry, block and dodge. Those are sound simple, but at the start - its kinda awkward and you gonna mess up timings a LOT. Finally, there's lots and LOTS of gore and blood.It CAN be repetative and tiresome - but it is what it is. We wanted a horde game about Nids - and we got it, what else would you want?Grimdark is really grim🟢The overall design of this game is a masterpiece. Its been a long time since I could actually immerse myself into Warhammer game. Swarms of bugs are everywhere. Literal PILES of dead bodies, disaster, actual war - I absolutely love it.🟡But the actual level design? - Mostly corridors with hidden collectibles here and there and thats it.About the music and sound design🟡Nothing to say here really, its your standart epic cinematic Warhammer OSt YouTube™ Video: Warhammer 40000: Space Marine 2 OST - Onslaught (Nima Fakhrara & Steve Molitz) Views: 419 Warhammer 40000: Space Marine 2 OST - Onslaught. Music By Nima Fakhrara and Steve Molitz 🟢Although I Really think that sounds in this game are amazing. The sounds of bolters, chainswords, tyranid screams - its just perfect.About the characters🟢Now this is also goodIm actually surprised how well TItus and his new comrades are developed through the story.Lots of different nids to shootThousand Sons are well presented (although not really fun to fight)The main villain is cool🔴The only thing I dont like (beside Chaplain) is Cadian Major....oooof now that is a bad decision if you ask me.In the grim dark future...there is only Grind🟡Finally, lets talk about Replay Value.Oh boy, after you've done with the campaign and collect every collectible and done every achivo that could be done in single player (curse you Terminator Combo and curse you Save From Ravener)Its time for PVP and PVE🔴PVP is easy to do (for now since people are active) but 5 kills-in-a-row is rough🔴But PVE......well. I hope you have a LOT of spare time because you gonna need it. The game challenges you with levelling up one of the 6 playable classes. And also levelling up at least one ranged and melee weapons. Finally - beat at least one coop mission on hardest difficulty (which is not that hard tbh) The difficulty in coop missions relies a lot on your actual level.🔴After you do that - its time for 41k kills - have fun.Conclusion🟡Its a good game. It really is.But its FAAAR from being perfect. I love it, I wanna love it even more. But will I get back to it after some time? Probably not since - its not memey enough as SM1 and not exactly original either.Hell, after I've put 40+ hours into this game I started to feel like Im playing Fireteam Elite again instead of Space Marine.

"2022 Ok I think it might be a good time for a re-reviewEver since immortal empires had arrived, this game feels SOO much betterIt feels like we were given an underwhelming appetizer, only to receive an absolutely delicious main course Many patches and updates had arrived after I made a previous review, fixing areas that were previous mentioned such as Rifts, balancing issues and Anti-Player bias AITo be honest, the Realm of chaos campaign is still meh, atleast its not as bad as before and can be fun at timesThe Prologue is still really good for anything else they have done and is actually a pretty good tutorial on teaching new-comers how the game works and its mechanics Oh boy Immortal empires my beloved, this is the true reason why any would get this game. A giant map with all different sorts of factions scattered around and unique experiences for basically every legendary lord in the rosterMany campaigns with different lords can have interesting experiences whether it be the challenge, the opponents you face, the allies you make, the battles you fight, and so on.All of the factions can be a blast, and those who are considered a less enjoyable experience still have their moments of joy. Immortal empires map is actually ridiculously huge and many parts of the map are aesthetically pleasing to look at with many small details that add more to the world of warhammer. Personally Cathay and the realms of chaos are very nice locationsThe graphics of this game are very good, the models are great, and the fact the CA had taken old games workshop models and updated them for the game is incredible.One thing I must say about the game is that the performance can be rough, the immortal empires map can be rough for performance (atleast for my computer)On top of all of this, this game is 8 PLAYER COOP! with simultaneous turns so no waiting for others to end their turns. This is the game I was waiting for when I first played total war: warhammer 2, this game has truly restored itself and has DLC coming along in the future.

"2022 Before i start, i want to say that every experience is subjective. So for you to have a little bit of context about my experience of the game :- I've already played and finished dark souls (I,II,III) and sekiro and i really liked those games.- I play video games regulary but i'm not that good, i can struggle and i'm not a ""sweat"" type player- I did not experienced any performance issues while playing elden ring for some reason, even with my laptop (gtx1070, 16 gb of ram)- Even if give the game 10/10, i don't think EVERYONE, should play it, every games are differents and offers differents type of experience and therefore, every game is not meant for everybody.BUTElden ring is for me a : masterpiece. As an artist who works in the videogame industry, i find the art direction unmatched, the graphical quality of the game is not meant to reproduce the reality with gorgeous texture but i look FANTASTIC nevertheless. As you progress to the world you are in constant ah of what the game as to offer in his character design, places, music everything come together to immerse the player in the dangerous world of the land between.The game in itself is extremely dense there are cave, ruin, fort, castle in every corner, and it feels really rewarding to be curious, because of the variety of enemies and unique loot to find in those caves. Even with an open world dense like that, the main level that you have to go through for the story have the same quality of the game before them, but with a lot more verticality you Can go 3 time in the same castle and find 3 differents way to explore it.In term of gameplay, for a ""souls veterant"" like me, i feel like this game offers the most ways to build your character in any ways you want, you can customize weapons by swapping theyre special attacks, and use whatever tool you want to tackle the game difficulty : you want to be a tanky mage ? A fast bowman ? A heavy knight with dragons power ? You can do it and mix everything while still maintining it viable and enjoyable.Now let's talk about the elephant in the room : The difficulty. If you're new to the serie i think this is the best place to start, elden ring is still challenging in the classical souls way, but there is a loot of tools to give the player a little rest in combat (like summoning npc to fight with you on command) and a lot of ranged weapons and ways to fight.Additionaly, elden ring being an open world you can explore the world to seamlessly lvl up before trying to tackle a boss. This give the player room to breath in between bosses.I will add that from software games are suffering from their reputation of being difficult. It's not an easy game, and it requires a little bit of getting used to. But after some time if you're willing to learn how the games works, you can finish the game without that much of problems. And i really encourage people to do it because it's really rewarding.For me who was tired of most recent video games, Elden ring give the fresh experiencz i needed to ""fall in love in a game"" once again. The last time i felt like this playing was in zelda breath of the wild, it feels like i'm entering a new world, with everything to learn and it's a lot lot lot of fun.And uf you're worry about the lenght of the game, be not. It's really really big and it has a lot of quests outside of the main one, it take probalbly 80 to 100 hours to finish the first playthrough, without taking all the npc quests.So yeah 10/10 because Elden ring is exactly what itns aspiring to be, it's different from everything i've played, it's beautyfull it sounds good, the voice acting is perfect, i'm never bored while exploring the open world, it's not frustrating to fight boss, and it has a lot of replayability with all the builds and differents branch of quests(And yes it's different from dark souls, it's not just BIG DARK SOULS 4) Don't hesitate give it a go.",start want say everi experi subject littl bit context experi game ive alreadi play finish dark soul iiiiii sekiro realli like game play video game regulari im good struggl im sweat type player experienc perform issu play elden ring reason even laptop gb ram even give game dont think everyon play everi game differ offer differ type experi therefor everi game meant everybodybutelden ring masterpiec artist work videogam industri find art direct unmatch graphic qualiti game meant reproduc realiti gorgeou textur look fantast nevertheless progress world constant ah game offer charact design place music everyth come togeth immers player danger world land betweenth game extrem dens cave ruin fort castl everi corner feel realli reward curiou varieti enemi uniqu loot find cave even open world dens like main level go stori qualiti game lot vertic go time castl find differ way explor itin term gameplay soul veter like feel like game offer way build charact way want custom weapon swap theyr special attack use whatev tool want tackl game difficulti want tanki mage fast bowman heavi knight dragon power mix everyth still maintin viabl enjoyablenow let talk eleph room difficulti your new seri think best place start elden ring still challeng classic soul way loot tool give player littl rest combat like summon npc fight command lot rang weapon way fightadditionali elden ring open world explor world seamlessli lvl tri tackl boss give player room breath bossesi add softwar game suffer reput difficult easi game requir littl bit get use time your will learn game work finish game without much problem realli encourag peopl realli rewardingfor tire recent video game elden ring give fresh experiencz need fall love game last time felt like play zelda breath wild feel like im enter new world everyth learn lot lot lot funand uf your worri lenght game realli realli big lot quest outsid main one take probalbl hour finish first playthrough without take npc questsso yeah elden ring exactli itn aspir differ everyth ive play beautyful sound good voic act perfect im never bore explor open world frustrat fight boss lot replay build differ branch questsand ye differ dark soul big dark soul dont hesit give go

"2023 I preordered the game and wanted to save my review for later on and I feel that now is the time. I'm a fan since the beginning. Truly, the game is the most crazy undertaking in the whole history of pc strategy games. I had a blast, like I had a blast with CW games in the past.I stopped playing when the Chaos Dwarves DLC came out. It felt too much like a rip off. It opened my eyes. Let me show you:I bought some games and DLCs on sale, some not. At 10$ per DLC (averaging down), + 17$ for Warhammer 1 (that I never played, bought it on sale for the factions), + 50$ on WH2, + 80$ for WH3,+ 30$ for Champions of Chaos, I'm at 350$ lol and rounding down. I'm not even couting sale taxes, which we have in Canada. Am I that stupid? How did I let that happen without even realizing it?Part of this is is on me, sure, but how the hell did we come to this?Well, I choose not to be a part of this anymore. Life is not getting cheaper.

"So i was really excited for space marine 2, I've played the first and its a classic among warhammer fans however space marine 2 has been nothing but buggy upon release. In a campaign that is designed to be played with friends, there are so many bugs that make it impossible. firstly when we assembled the squad it all seemed fin until we got the infinite loading servers bug. OK we thought that it would be an easy fix, just turn off steam overlay and some other stuff and it will work. and it did... the first time. After that we got to actually play, it was about 20 mins of fun until we got soft locked at the flower wall on the first mission. A quick reload to last checkpoint and we were good.... for all about 10 mins when we got soft locked again at the airlock entrance of the bunker. this time loading the checkpoint didnt work so we decided to start the mission over again. that was until we got the infinite loading bug again... At its current state space marines 2 is an unplayable buggy mess for us, id imagine playing single player might work but the campaign is clearly designed for multiplayer and that just isn't working for us.",realli excit space marin ive play first classic among warhamm fan howev space marin noth buggi upon releas campaign design play friend mani bug make imposs firstli assembl squad seem fin got infinit load server bug ok thought would easi fix turn steam overlay stuff work first time got actual play min fun got soft lock flower wall first mission quick reload last checkpoint good min got soft lock airlock entranc bunker time load checkpoint didnt work decid start mission got infinit load bug current state space marin unplay buggi mess us id imagin play singl player might work campaign clearli design multiplay isnt work us

"2022 This Game is a recommend with a hard ""but"". As of Patch 1.021, there have been insane complaints from the same reviewers who highly recommended this game that the performance was terrible and was in fact worse than the patch they were given to play and review on. I believe this will get fixed and I believe the reviewers who recommended this game didn't lie at all about the strong points of this game. When looking past the stuttering in new regions, you will see an amazing open world, difficult enemies, a beginner friendly travel system, more difficult enemies, loot, and more difficult enemies! I have not been by any means a fan of the Soulsborne series however saw its charm in my quick demo of playing DS3.

"2019 I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.",probabl wont popular opinion feel none lessi play cs lot first releas mod halflif put hundr hour pub match match friend privat server stop play time make move retail product counterstrik franchis someth time capsul exampl late shooter frozen time never realli chang probabl make novel averag gamer import competit scene form around taken control lot waysbecaus esport style competit scene form around counterstrik put valv difficult posit cant realli chang anyth without face harsh resist veteran player even minor visual chang met extrem critic may upset care cultiv metait alway like play idea esport level competit play start manifest thu rare find ultracompetit player get wrap memor spread pattern research domin strategi read establish meta lot player back fun play huge playerbas thu mean server alway reason availableplay counterstrik back commit overal behavior playerbas differ may gotten usual smack talk match peopl tell thing exactli certain way order whole thing play like esport match either least great numberplay counterstrik essenti test see much like get pubstomp uberexperienc ultracompetit player overli welcom place new player though everyon neg new player help cultur cultur either realli cool annoy hell much room anyth betweenif want competit game experi larg shape competit vocal player counterstrik want someth like typic modern shooter someth casual best place startin end opinion understand counterstrik go differ experi differ peopl know probabl bit old thu miss competit level game boat year chang fact play counterstrik global offens cultur form around game someth realli get mileag cours may

The game still has countless bugs, and listing them would take too long (others have thankfully done this already on their reviews), all the while they have the gall to charge 25 dollars for the new DLC, which was the same price as the Chaos Dwarfs with like 150% less content. I'm absolutely revolted especially by their recent statement to the community, in which they basically said they will stop support for the game if we don't suck it up and buy their overpriced lacking in content DLC, which will probably introduce new bugs that wont be fixed for months on end. Due to these recent developments, I can no longer support this franchise; I could not recommend this game, or this company's products to anyone in good faith anymore, and thus I will be uninstalling Warhammer 3, and will never buy another CA product until these issues are resolved in a timely and fair manner.",play total war game sinc empir around hour total own total war game warhamm absolut disgrac game still countless bug list would take long other thank done alreadi review gall charg dollar new dlc price chao dwarf like less content im absolut revolt especi recent statement commun basic said stop support game dont suck buy overpr lack content dlc probabl introduc new bug wont fix month end due recent develop longer support franchis could recommend game compani product anyon good faith anymor thu uninstal warhamm never buy anoth ca product issu resolv time fair manner

"2022 As someone who has been a huge fan of the total war series since Empire total war back in 2009, I have over 5000 hours of game play through the different games, I feel like I have a good understanding of these games.I have to say Warhammer 3 has been a huge disappointment from the start, very limited amount of factions to play if you're only playing the WH3 campaign, very limited set of units for each factions with most factions only have 2 units of renown, main story isn't too bad, but after doing it 3-4 times it gets very repetitive as theres isn't many ways to complete the campaign, and some factions are absolutely terrible compared to the others (Legion of Chaos is one, all units you get are weak versions of the actual factions worshipping a single chaos god). The main campaign also have some game breaking bugs that just make the game not fun to play, as example my buddy got one of his settlements attacked, drops in to the battle and the ogres that are attacking him bug at the entrance of the settlement and sit there till they're dead giving him free wins when it clearly shouldn't. Some battles the players has clearly the stronger army, lord and heroes but when you attack it says something along the lines of ""valiant defeat"" when you know for a fact that the Iron Dragon of Cathay is supposed to eat up nurglings like his morning cereal, but you're then forced to waste 5-10 minutes of your time to do a drop in battle that was completely unnecessary to begin with. You can select units and send them somewhere but for some reason they stand still even after selecting and trying to move them 5 times. For the immortal empire, I am aware that they're still working on it and it will get better, but with the last patch its only made things worst, they removed minor settlement siege battles cause apparently people live in the trees now instead of buildings and for some reason they're constantly making the terrain a hill for my opponents. As for large settlements the tower placements are terrible often being behind tall buildings or walls so the tower shots never connect, they constantly hit everything but the intended targets. Wall get taken down by peasants with swords or spears, towers get murdered by tier 1 harpies that literally lose to everything else. Your units will also break moral in the stupidest way (running while being 80-90% hp and into the enemy units instead of running away) and for no reason even if you're sitting with 14+ healthy units with a lord and heroes still being present. I could keep ranting amount all the other issues I've found, but it would taken way too much time. Anyway all this to say, Total War Warhammer 3 is an incomplete game with an industrial amount of balancing and bug fixing until it becomes fun and worth while to play, and currently the only fun part of the game is the Immortal empire that doesn't even allow players to select other races apart from the WH3 if they don't own all 3 Warhammer games, example buddy of mine has WH3 and WH2 with all dlcs, but the game won't let him choose a WH2 faction even though he already owns the content of it, he was forced to buy WH1 to be able to access the other factions that he's already paid for. I will not be returning to WH3 until the game has been worked on some more and even then I'll probably have to pay more to get the additional content that we were supposed to have to begin with, so I may refund the game and stick to WH2, I don't know anymore.

"2022 I think it's finally time to change this review from negative to positive. A lot has happened and changed since I last updated this review, but the gist of it is, that CA has done a good job on fixing some of the glaring issues and began a sincere communication with their TWWH community. The game itself has an insane amount of content, looks good, runs good, sounds good. Really scratches that strategy game itch that one gets from time to time (beware the ""just one more turn"" syndrome!). Workshop mods add and change just about every aspect of the game, modify it however you want to achieve your perfect setup.OLD REVIEW BELOWGame is really close to being good, but I just can't give it a positive review now.AI is janky as hell.Badly designed Realms of Chaos (I'm looking at you, Tzeentch).Game randomly kicks me to main menu after some battles and corrupts the last save.Hopefully all of it gets fixed, but for now, it's not worth the pricetag.EDIT: Immortal Empires have arrived.

"2022 If you do not own Total War Warhammer 2; you should get that over this. That game is leagues more developed and fleshed out than this game is. The story for TW WH2 is hands down better than this mess. The mechanics of TWWH2 are better thought out and handled.Overwhelmingly this game is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mod of TWWH2 that just levels nerfs across the board at every race and strategy that could be employed to beat a game that only made itself more difficult by giving the AI broken cheats.Rather than address issues and correct problems with the AI or mechanics of the game the devs just chose to nerf the solutions to those problems, while ignoring overlapping bugs/glitches that were carried over from TWWH2. You will find the same, or similar bugs, in this game as you will find in TWWH2 but in TWWH2 you will at least get unique races that all get interesting end game rewards for completing campaigns.This game currently has one mode and is not slated to get any improvements or alternates to that mode until June (AFAIK) of 2022. Months after its release it is not going to have things that TWWH2 had on launch.This game really feels like it was a product of a secondary dev team that had no communication or interactions with the people that made the prior game fun and enjoyable. This game really feels like it was just someone's pet project for some resume padding and they didn't care what was actually produced.This game was horrifically phoned in.How do I know? Well, spoiler, when you win the campaign you are given a demon prince to command your armies. Thats neat, if you are a demon faction, but when you play a human or non-demon faction guess what your reward for beating the demons (a group of creatures that is, in the lore, antithetical to your existence)? If you guess that your human queen character who just spent years banishing demons back to hell is going to be given THE original demon prince to lead her armies, rather than getting an embodiment of her countries religion or even an avatar of her bear god she worked so hard to save, then you are correct.There is no variance to the rewards for completing the campaign with different factions, other than steam achievements. There is no benefits gained from completing important milestones in the overarching campaign. There is nothing but ridiculous challenges put in front of you that are still beaten by the nerfed units that you will eventually use.Think about that for a second. The devs have overwhelmingly nerfed units that were used to win the hardest difficulty campaigns in the prior game and THEY STILL FAILED TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOAL. Even with nerfs there are certain units that you will always use over others, just because of cost effectiveness, and the only thing that was accomplished by the devs overuse of the nerf-stick was the disappearing of weird and wonky armies.Also, auto-resolve (what you used to avoid having to spend 40mins on a battle that should of been an easy win) has been changed to always be punishing to the player. You could have a full elite army going against two dudes in a hovel, and your elite army will come out of the autoresolve almost obliterated from two mud farmers with broken shovels.This game is nothing but a half-assed attempt at some DLC for TWWH2 that brings nothing really new to the series or world, and actually retcons a lot of stuff from the prior game, while also being incredibly boring to play. I've spent more time trying to undo the massively dumb decisions my allied AI make or correct weird things that happen to me than I have anything else.It just isn't worth it. Wait till maybe December and check back in, or until this game comes on a deep-deep sale (like 50% off or more) before dropping money on this, as you aren't really getting $60's worth of a game.Instead, if you really want to play a game like this, go to TW:WH2 and get that. Its expensive for the full game/dlc, but just get the base game and use the free-lc until the rest is on sale.

"2022 I very rarely write reviews, but my conscience compels me to warn others so that they might avoid the massive disappointment that this game is to fans of the Total War: Warhammer series. The most glaring issues are both related to gameplay, as well as technical. I am honestly astounded by the state of the game, even now, nearly five months after release. It's as if the game didn't pass through any sort of quality control at all. Other reviews have done a great job of detailing the gameplay issues, so I will merely mention the technical issues I encountered myself. I have a Radeon RX 6600, and I can barely eek out 30 fps in this game. To say the game is poorly optimized would be an understatement. If I let the game choose setting, and use the ""Recommended"" settings, the fps drop to around 15, rendering the game completely unplayable. If you by any chance read this while considering to buy this game; do not. Go buy Total War: Warhammer II instead, if you do not already have it, as it is superior in almost every way.

"2022 This is the best souls game. Hell, this is the best game. Git gud.Edit: If you are a veteran invader you will probably not like this game. This is much more focused around the open world exploration and co-op aspects of the game than it is the PvP. With that being said, this game also has the absolute worst camera angle I have seen in any title by Fromsoft, which makes some of the main story bosses incredibly unpleasant to fight. All of the ""build diversity"" really goes away in PvP, when you need to use bloodhound step to survive almost any situation that involves more than one opponent. No true combos means its crazy hard to turn and burn and get a reset if you are getting chased by multiple opponents. I don't see the longevity in the Invasion scene in this game. Really sad for someone who has put countless hours into PvP in both DS2 and DS3. 1v1 duels will most likely be more popular than ever before.The auto camera recovery has to be broken cause even with the setting off it bounces off walls all the time. When you lock onto a boss, and it does an animation where it is moving quickly, your camera will go nuts. I personally felt as if I was fighting the camera more than the boss half the time. All that being said a single main story play-through still netted me around 100 hours and thats pretty killer compared to most releases in general.

"2022 Game Good!!!If you like Strategy games this is the perfect franchise for it. Now I will say, the base game is okay, not the greatest IMO because the Realms of Chaos campaign mechanic isn't that fun. It's tedious and depending on the faction you are playing you can conquer basically the whole map before you can actually win the campaign. If you have the Champions of Chaos DLC the Realms of Chaos campaign is good, since you operate on a different mechanic that feels much better.Let's get into the juice of the game. The game is 100% at it's best when you own all 3 games because it will give you access to the Immortal Empires campaign which combines all the maps from the previous games into 1 BIG map with all of the previous factions on it. You don't have any gimmicks to worry about. It's just conquer the map with a few objectives depending on your faction. It's a giant sandbox where you'll have roughly 86 different Legendary Lords to play, each with different starts, abilities, buffs, etc. Also, you don't need to own all 3 of the games to play IE (Immortal Empires), if you have a friend that owns all 3 games you can play it with him. YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO USE THE STUFF YOU OWN. So if you only have the 3rd game you can only use factions from the 3rd game. If you own the 2nd and 3rd game you can use the respective factions and DLC that you own. You can have up to 8 player campaigns that you can do entirely coop or however you want. You want to have to have an alliance with someone and go to war with someone else go for it. You all also get to have your turns at the same time which is a great feature, so you aren't stuck waiting for someone else to do their turn while you just sit there twiddling your thumbs. You can now get into situations where maybe the want to attack your army and they start walking towards your lord, you can walk your lord away.There is a lot of variety in the units and the battles are one of the biggest highlights of the game for me personally. The campaign map is like Civilization, but when you clash with another army or whatever it becomes more of an RTS where you control your units. It's honestly so much fun!I give the game a 6/10 with no DLC's or mods with just the base campaign. With mods, you can get rid of the Realms of Chaos mechanic which adds more replayability to the game because you can focus on more that just the dumb portals. Don't get me wrong Realms of Chaos is good for 1 playthrough after that it's tedious. With access to Immortal Empires the game shoots up to a 9/10 for me. As it offers a ton of variety that can make the game feel fresh with all the different races and factions to choose from.",game goodif like strategi game perfect franchis say base game okay greatest imo realm chao campaign mechan isnt fun tediou depend faction play conquer basic whole map actual win campaign champion chao dlc realm chao campaign good sinc oper differ mechan feel much betterlet get juic game game best game give access immort empir campaign combin map previou game big map previou faction dont gimmick worri conquer map object depend faction giant sandbox youll roughli differ legendari lord play differ start abil buff etc also dont need game play ie immort empir friend own game play abl use stuff game use faction game game use respect faction dlc player campaign entir coop howev want want allianc someon go war someon els go also get turn time great featur arent stuck wait someon els turn sit twiddl thumb get situat mayb want attack armi start walk toward lord walk lord awayther lot varieti unit battl one biggest highlight game person campaign map like civil clash anoth armi whatev becom rt control unit honestli much funi give game dlc mod base campaign mod get rid realm chao mechan add replay game focu dumb portal dont get wrong realm chao good playthrough tediou access immort empir game shoot offer ton varieti make game feel fresh differ race faction choos

"Story is about 10 hours of gameplay (including doing the side coop missions at least once, that are part of the story, but also the content you grind after) and I enjoyed it for what it was. I think this is a great intro to the 40k universe/lore for people new to it.The gameplay is fun and with the classes and guns available right now there is enough variation to enjoy and keep playing. Where the game does lack though, is the mission content. The re-playable/grind-able missions I feel will get a bit boring after maybe 20-30 hours of grinding them. There is some variation in spawns (elites/bosses can spawn in certain parts of the mission path) but with the few missions that you can run, it isn't enough. Granted the devs plan to expand this later.There is a PVP mode that will extend the games life a bit but I am yet to try it, although I think it is probably gonna be quite fun.The game looks beautiful and runs smooth for me (7950x3d, 4090FE, 64gb 6000mhz ram) with the only issue being - when I try to quit the game, it doesn't actually quit. I have to kill it manually.Overall, id recommend this but if you are only here for the story - wait for it to be expanded with DLC releases or wait for the game to go on a 50% sale. I also got the ultra edition - don't do this unless you just want to support the game, the content it gives you over the Gold isn't really worth it.",stori hour gameplay includ side coop mission least part stori also content grind enjoy think great intro universelor peopl new itth gameplay fun class gun avail right enough variat enjoy keep play game lack though mission content replayablegrind mission feel get bit bore mayb hour grind variat spawn elitesboss spawn certain part mission path mission run isnt enough grant dev plan expand laterther pvp mode extend game life bit yet tri although think probabl gon na quit funth game look beauti run smooth ram issu tri quit game doesnt actual quit kill manuallyoveral id recommend stori wait expand dlc releas wait game go sale also got ultra edit dont unless want support game content give gold isnt realli worth

"8/10 Game is really solid so far. A lot of Souls-mechanics without the punishment that comes along with it. So far, bosses have been fun to beat. Story is somewhat easy to follow given the amount of lore they provide. Love the skill tree respec available at any time, allowing for strategy changes for different bosses. Overall, a pretty solid game!Some issues that I have with this game:1) Invisible walls - invisible walls are very frustrating because it gives you a feeling that you have a big area to explore, only to be frustrated when you hit the wall. For crying out loud, there's even ledges that have invisible walls, only to find out later that you can explore the lower area! Either provide a skill that reduces fall damage, or design the map so that it actually shows the boundary of the area.2) Graphical issues - 3070Ti is suffering with FSR, Very High Graphics. You can literally lose a boss fight from stuttering and frame drops.3) Traversal - map traversal is so boring. Like, you have a monkey... that won't even swing around. I'm currently at chapter 3 and there doesn't seem to be any hint of that mechanic in the game. Even Jump doesn't have much use outside of combat, and when you do use it, it's so janky, and also, links back to the invisible walls issue. Sure, there's bits where you can transform into something, but it's not as fun as vine swinging (or web swinging as Spidey).4) UI Design - generally, the UI is pretty solid. My issue is the item ""wheel"". There are drink names that doesn't align against their intended effect. You would think ""Evil Repelling Drink"" is some kind of holy negation drink right? WRONG! It's Physical Damage Negation buff! So... I hope they fix this by adding icons of the drink effect in the item wheel.",game realli solid far lot soulsmechan without punish come along far boss fun beat stori somewhat easi follow given amount lore provid love skill tree respec avail time allow strategi chang differ boss overal pretti solid gamesom issu invis wall invis wall frustrat give feel big area explor frustrat hit wall cri loud there even ledg invis wall find later explor lower area either provid skill reduc fall damag design map actual show boundari graphic issu suffer fsr high graphic liter lose boss fight stutter frame travers map travers bore like monkey wont even swing around im current chapter doesnt seem hint mechan game even jump doesnt much use outsid combat use janki also link back invis wall issu sure there bit transform someth fun vine swing web swing ui design gener ui pretti solid issu item wheel drink name doesnt align intend effect would think evil repel drink kind holi negat drink right wrong physic damag negat buff hope fix ad icon drink effect item wheel

Hypnotic fighting flow and hyper-detailed environment! Love this game.,hypnot fight flow hyperdetail environ love game
"2022 The QoL changes from WH2 to WH3 are enough to reccomend this game on their own. The improvements to alliances, sieges, corruption are all very welcome additions. This isn't quite the same leap as between TWWH1 & 2, but still very nice improvements The new factions while a bit barebones at the moment, are all excellent both in variety between them and in how well they match the flavour of their factions. The Daemon Prince in particular is an excellent achievement I really enjoyed. It seems for this game CA have really invested in immersing in the Warhammer world, to an even greater extent than in the other 2 games in the series. For example the campaign map now has little icons you can hover over to get some lore information about particular sites of interest throughout the world. Which makes it even more surprising that the lore bits of previous games - Lord quests and Landmark building - seem to have been scaled back a lot. There are very few landmarks of any kind and the quests are no longer multi-stage with you having to perform several tasks to get to the end goal. I have not done all of them yet, but the ones I have done have consisted of ""get to level X and fight a battle"" with little justification for the battle and no preparatory steps beforehand. There is a caveat however. As it stands WH3 is much more strongly narratively driven than any Total War game there has been before, including WH2. The campaign is constrained by the story (though not to the extent others have said, it is perfectly possible to have a large Empire and constant expansion). 1.1 has added the ability to ignore the story to an extent but you still have to play around it even if you don't engage with it. This is not an issue for me, I enjoy a different approach to a Total War campaign than the usual paint the map Empire building and having to work within the bounds of the narrative comes with its own challenges and difficulties. In particular a lot of the mechanics serve as anti-snowball features; the larger your Empire the more intrusive these mechanics become so the late-game stage of previous total wars where you are no longer threatened by anyone and just finishing off the map painting is harder to achieve. However many longtime Total War fans are not enjoying the different direction of the main campaign and the constraints on playstyle.As of writing there is no roadmap or timeline for future expansions. The ""Immortal Empires"" campaign, a combined map of all 3 games including all the factions is coming at some point (hopefully soon) and will introduce a much larger and more sandbox mode, so if a ""normal"" Total War experience is what you are after I would wait until this mode is out. This mode also requires you to own all 3 Total War games on the same platform (Steam, Epic etc.) which is a lot of investment for someone new to the series.There are also quite a number of bugs, some game-breaking, others just annoying. These are being actively worked on and based on the experience with other TW games a lot of these will be ironed out in time. I have played 6 campaigns now and only one of them has broken to the point I had to abandon it but others have all had little irritants. I have still played nearly 300 hours in 2 months though, so clearly these bugs do not overly diminish the fun I have had with the game.Performance has been a bit of an issue for me as well. WH2 I played on Ultra settings for everything and only occassionally had a slowdown very late into the campaign. WH3 I am still able to play on Ultra settings, and the battles function at a good framerate, but the campaign map starts struggling to keep up from ~turn 50 onwards, with long pauses while it figures something out and frequent frame drops.Battle has some oddities. With 1.1. cavalry feel better than they have in any other entry in the series, and infantry are more responsive but there are still issues with infantry movement and ranged unit targeting when ordered. 1.1 was a large improvement and it looks like CA are still working on ironing out the issues. For the most part battles feel essentially the same as in WH2, though the AI does seem to have been improved. For example in WH2 the AI would always attempt to flank with their cavalry. This involved swinging cavalry out to the wings then charging into the flanks. If you placed units covering the flanks the AI would more often than not just charge into the covering unit, regardless of if that was a good matchup for them. In WH3 enemy cavalry will continue to move around and position themselves until they find a good angle to attack. They will move around your anti-large units and go for your artillery or missile units instead. There are still issues with the AI recognising that just because it is considered the defender doesn't mean standing still and waiting is the best tactic, but overall it feels much more intelligent than WH2. The AI struggles with the new sieges a little, never seeming to make up its mind whether it wants to fight or cap points, leading to it not doing either very efficiently. Additionally pathfinding in settlements can be pretty difficult. The AI does make fairly good use of the new supplies mechanic (though it cheats a bit on cooldown times and rarely if ever builds higher-tier towers, preferring to spam out the cheaper lower-tier ones), which is nice to see.The new ""survival battles"" are very nice and provide a good variety for the player. However they are LONG and draining. They can be autoresolved, aside from the last one which is good because sometimes I am just not up for the effort a survival battle takes, however auto-resolve is very punishing on the higher difficulties, so you can end up in a bit of a lose-lose when coming up to one of these.In short:Pros: Many QoL features that are improvements over TW2 New factions are excellent More immersive in Warhammer universe than the previous 2 games AI improvements (For me) The narrative-driven campaign forcing new playstyles and new solutions to issuesCons: Long-time fans are not enjoying the main campaign story Some bugs Some battle quirks that need fixing Performance issuesI rate this game 8/10 as it currently stands, and I have little doubt that number will rise as more patches and expansions come to the game",qol chang enough reccomend game improv allianc sieg corrupt welcom addit isnt quit leap still nice improv new faction bit barebon moment excel varieti well match flavour faction daemon princ particular excel achiev realli enjoy seem game ca realli invest immers warhamm world even greater extent game seri exampl campaign map littl icon hover get lore inform particular site interest throughout world make even surpris lore bit previou game lord quest landmark build seem scale back lot landmark kind quest longer multistag perform sever task get end goal done yet one done consist get level x fight battl littl justif battl preparatori step beforehand caveat howev stand much strongli narr driven total war game includ campaign constrain stori though extent other said perfectli possibl larg empir constant expans ad abil ignor stori extent still play around even dont engag issu enjoy differ approach total war campaign usual paint map empir build work within bound narr come challeng difficulti particular lot mechan serv antisnowbal featur larger empir intrus mechan becom lategam stage previou total war longer threaten anyon finish map paint harder achiev howev mani longtim total war fan enjoy differ direct main campaign constraint playstylea write roadmap timelin futur expans immort empir campaign combin map game includ faction come point hope soon introduc much larger sandbox mode normal total war experi would wait mode mode also requir total war game platform steam epic etc lot invest someon new seriesther also quit number bug gamebreak other annoy activ work base experi tw game lot iron time play campaign one broken point abandon other littl irrit still play nearli hour month though clearli bug overli diminish fun gameperform bit issu well play ultra set everyth occassion slowdown late campaign still abl play ultra set battl function good framer campaign map start struggl keep turn onward long paus figur someth frequent frame dropsbattl odditi cavalri feel better entri seri infantri respons still issu infantri movement rang unit target order larg improv look like ca still work iron issu part battl feel essenti though ai seem improv exampl ai would alway attempt flank cavalri involv swing cavalri wing charg flank place unit cover flank ai would often charg cover unit regardless good matchup enemi cavalri continu move around posit find good angl attack move around antilarg unit go artilleri missil unit instead still issu ai recognis consid defend doesnt mean stand still wait best tactic overal feel much intellig ai struggl new sieg littl never seem make mind whether want fight cap point lead either effici addit pathfind settlement pretti difficult ai make fairli good use new suppli mechan though cheat bit cooldown time rare ever build higherti tower prefer spam cheaper lowerti one nice seeth new surviv battl nice provid good varieti player howev long drain autoresolv asid last one good sometim effort surviv battl take howev autoresolv punish higher difficulti end bit loselos come one thesein shortpro mani qol featur improv new faction excel immers warhamm univers previou game ai improv narrativedriven campaign forc new playstyl new solut issuescon longtim fan enjoy main campaign stori bug battl quirk need fix perform issuesi rate game current stand littl doubt number rise patch expans come game

"""Black Myth: Wukong"" is definitely the most talked-about game in China in recent years. You know, in the Chinese gaming market, which is flooded with online games and pay-to-win mobile games, making an indie game was once considered a surefire way to lose money and fail. But the release of Black Myth has completely shattered that notion, showing investors the massive potential of this market. I bet in the future, China will be able to produce more high-quality AAA games that you can just buy outright!Here is the main text of the review.:Pros:1. The game features highly detailed sculpture models created from high-precision real-world scans, along with finely crafted scene modeling.2. The voice acting and soundtrack are incredibly immersive.3. It has an excellent and well-developed combat and progression system.4. There are several well-produced cutscenes, each with a distinct style.5. The game is based on the classic Chinese mythological novel Journey to the West. Many Chinese people have dreamed of becoming the Monkey King, Sun Wukong, and in a way, this game helps us fulfill that childhood dream!Cons:1. The invisible walls aren't well-defined, which is frustrating when areas that look accessible actually aren't.2. The lighting contrast is too high, and the diffuse reflection is too low, making the shadows overly dark.3. The color palette in some chapters is too monotonous, lacking visual guidance, which makes it easy to get lost.4.

"35 hours in, and I’m still at the beginning of Chapter 5. I thought this game was pretty linear at first, but oh gosh, there is so much to do in each chapter, so many secrets to uncover, and not to mention, the graphics are so BEAUTIFUL!The story is interesting; after each chapter, I always go to YouTube to find explanations about the lore. The combat system is the highlight here; it’s so fluid and amazing! I don’t like Souls games because they are too hard for me, but in Wu Kong, I can defeat every boss in just a few attempts. I really love the cutscenes and music videos! Highly recommended and absolutely a contender for Game of the Year in 2024!P.S. ♥♥♥ those ""lack of diversity"" reviews!",hour im still begin chapter thought game pretti linear first oh gosh much chapter mani secret uncov mention graphic beautifulth stori interest chapter alway go youtub find explan lore combat system highlight fluid amaz dont like soul game hard wu kong defeat everi boss attempt realli love cutscen music video highli recommend absolut contend game year lack divers review

"Score: 8.5/10Story:What more can be said? The narrative is rooted in a true literary masterpiece. There are some interpretations that I find intriguing and aligned with the overall message the game seeks to convey, though I might have differing views on certain aspects of how they twisted the original story. However, that's purely subjective and doesn't detract from the quality of the story.Visuals and Design:I absolutely love the landscapes, character designs, and costumes. As someone who grew up reading Journey to the West, seeing the novel's mythical creatures brought to life in the game is an exhilarating experience. The environments are breathtaking and immersive, with the grand Buddha statues and some architectural elements leaving a profound impact on me. The game features some of the most stunning scenery I've ever encountered, and they all feel authentically reminiscent of places I’ve actually seen. It’s simply marvelous.Boss Design:The boss designs are quite impressive, with some moves that are visually striking and others that are distinctly unique. What sets them apart is that, they defy conventional tropes and offer a refreshing experience. This uniqueness is a credit to the original author of the novel and the ancient Chinese folklore he drew upon.I really like some of the bosses, but I can’t go into details since I want to avoid spoilers.Combat System:The combat animations are cool, and the spells are visually captivating, especially because I’m a huge fan of Wukong. The way the spells are represented aligns well with my expectations.However, this is where my main critique lies. I prefer engaging in combat by directly confronting enemies rather than relying heavily on dodging and waiting for an opening to strike, as in Souls-like games. This game isn’t a Souls-like, or at least it attempts to incorporate more character abilities, primarily through spell. In my opinion, the key distinction between action games and Souls-like games lies in how players can influence enemy behavior. Action games allow for interruptions, counters, and disruptions, rewarding players for such high-risk maneuvers with a strong sense of satisfaction.In this game, the Monkey can interrupt or parry enemies, but it’s done through heavy after light attack or spells rather than the core combat system. This, to me, is the biggest issue: it lacks a dedicated blocking or counter system, placing too much emphasis on dodging. Parrying with heavy is a nice idea to bring the fluidity into the combat but in quite a lot time you just fail. Also there are a lot of attacks which cannot be parry and the only option is to dodge, or use magic. This results in less interactive combat, which diminishes the overall experience. (In my opinion Ghost of Tsushima had excellent interactivity, though I understand it’s a different scenario with mostly human bosses in a low-magic setting.)Overall, I feel that while the heavy parry derived from the staff techniques and the spell abilities are intriguing, they fall short in delivering the level of interactivity needed to make the combat feel rewarding. Once the novelty wears off, the battles can feel somewhat monotonous.Map:The map is decent. Personally, I don't have a strong opinion on invisible walls, though I understand why others might find them frustrating. What I do wish for is a mini-map because I often struggle with navigation. Relying on online guides to find my way slightly detracts from the overall experience.Chapters:The game boasts one of the coolest and most epic prologues I've ever seen, delivering a significant impact. The first four chapters are solid, offering plenty of content and expansive maps. However, chapters five and six feel a bit rushed and could have been more fleshed out.The side quests are not very clear and you could miss them.",score said narr root true literari masterpiec interpret find intrigu align overal messag game seek convey though might differ view certain aspect twist origin stori howev that pure subject doesnt detract qualiti storyvisu designi absolut love landscap charact design costum someon grew read journey west see novel mythic creatur brought life game exhilar experi environ breathtak immers grand buddha statu architectur element leav profound impact game featur stun sceneri ive ever encount feel authent reminisc place ive actual seen simpli marvelousboss designth boss design quit impress move visual strike other distinctli uniqu set apart defi convent trope offer refresh experi uniqu credit origin author novel ancient chines folklor drew uponi realli like boss cant go detail sinc want avoid spoilerscombat systemth combat anim cool spell visual captiv especi im huge fan wukong way spell repres align well expectationshowev main critiqu lie prefer engag combat directli confront enemi rather reli heavili dodg wait open strike soulslik game game isnt soulslik least attempt incorpor charact abil primarili spell opinion key distinct action game soulslik game lie player influenc enemi behavior action game allow interrupt counter disrupt reward player highrisk maneuv strong sens satisfactionin game monkey interrupt parri enemi done heavi light attack spell rather core combat system biggest issu lack dedic block counter system place much emphasi dodg parri heavi nice idea bring fluiditi combat quit lot time fail also lot attack parri option dodg use magic result less interact combat diminish overal experi opinion ghost tsushima excel interact though understand differ scenario mostli human boss lowmag settingoveral feel heavi parri deriv staff techniqu spell abil intrigu fall short deliv level interact need make combat feel reward novelti wear battl feel somewhat monotonousmapth map decent person dont strong opinion invis wall though understand other might find frustrat wish minimap often struggl navig reli onlin guid find way slightli detract overal experiencechaptersth game boast one coolest epic prologu ive ever seen deliv signific impact first four chapter solid offer plenti content expans map howev chapter five six feel bit rush could flesh outth side quest clear could miss

"It's pretty good, definitely not perfect as it comes with some flaws but it's a well done sequel to the first game and I've been enjoying a lot. Visuals Game's visual aspect looks great, especially considering the absolute chaos you see happening on the screen with so many enemies swarming and things blowing up, with even small attention to detail existing such as the fact you get mud stains on your armour (and blood ofc) as you go through some of the marshy parts of the planet, it looks damn good but due to performance being somewhat shoddy, up scaling is needed which softens the image so people who can't stand temporal softness to an image will not be happy Optimizaiton Not good but not entirely terrible, you will need a modern mid range machine to run this at a solid-ish fps and even then you need to use up scaling tech, i got a 3060 and Ryzen 5700x, so as mid-range of a set up you can get today and i get on average 60 fps (usually) on a mix of High/Medium in 1080p but with DLSS Quality mode up scaling. There is also some shader stutter problems and loading times can sometimes be painfully long, so there's def optimisation work to be done still. New Gameplay Additions It's very much Space Marine but expanded upon for the most part, you now get timed dodging and parrying, which might take a bit to get used to. The parry windows are generous but that's due to the fact you're almost always dealing with utter chaos on your screen with so many things attacking you which is what adds to the challenge of dodging and parrying. Campaign It's about 8 - 10 Hours long, has full 3 player co-op support and 4 difficulties, Easy, Normal, Veteran, Angel Of Death. Overral, it's really good, especially the final act but it starts a lil so-soMore Info:I played through it solo on Veteran, my initial experience was a bit Luke-warm with the first few missions but it didn't take long for me to get more into it, especially since the campaign gets better as you progress it, early missions have this more frequent re-occurring issue that is present when you're playing solo, where certain segments feel like they're not meant for you to be on your own with the two AI partners that share a singular brain cell, such as for an example having to use a flame thrower to push back a swarm of tiny lil' insects whilst dealing with lots of ranged enemies and having to complete some objectives, problem is, the flamer takes you primary weapon away so all you're down to is your pistol for ranged enemies plus enemies in solo mode tend to focus more on the solo player than the two AI partners, so these situations can feel a bit bad . However , this starts becoming less so of a problem at the mid point of the campaign where it starts feeling like they put some more thought into making it more enjoyable when playing solo. The campaign as a whole is really damn good by the end, apart from some stumbles in design where it can very much feel like it's a Co-Op campaign with an optional solo mode from time to time, it's epic, doesn't over stay its welcome , ends on a pretty satisfying note with a spectacular final act fight that was incredibly kick a**. PvP Multiplayer A solid PvP experience, but it kinda is the 2nd class citizen of the package, it has its balancing quirks in design that might get more notable/annoying as i play but it is an improvement over SM1's PvP largely due to it having dedicated servers, no more peer to peer constant lagging and host migrations and the addition of abilities adds a decent bit of more spiceMore Info:Just like in SM1's it's just 6v6 across 3 maps and 3 game modes, Annihilation (TDM), Seize Ground(Domination) and a KOTH-like mode with 6 classes . So it's light on the map variety but offers more variety than SM1 in terms of game play styles with more classes of which each one now has a unique ability to use, a frontal shield for the devastator heavy, a AoE chapter banner that heal's people armour from the Bulwark class or brief invisibility for the sniper and so forth.So far have dug into it a fair bit, melee is a notibly weaker compared to SM1's PvP, this is potentially partially due to the lag problems of SM1's not offering extra protection for lag-teleporting assault marines who due to SM1's bad netcode would often just ignore half of the damage you threw at em'. The game is also more team depended now, certain classes work together really well, the Bulwark is a shield guy with a power sword, his shield can absorb all ranged damage and surprisingly he can do it forever basically unless he gets hit from behind and then to boot he can deploy an AoE armor regen for everyone , so when you combine him with the heavy devastator class you got a combo that can deal with ranged and CQC targets very well , covering each others weaknesses and offering an armor heal from the bulwark and a frontal shield from the heavy devastator to keep each other in the fight.It's not half bad at all , matter of fact was somewhat addictive for me during the first two weeks of release but there are some balancing quirks such as the Bulwark turtle players and flash nade spams that can suck the fun out of it.However i do wish they did more with it, i wish it was 12v12 perhaps instead of 6v6, i wish the Chaos Marines could be properly customised, unlike loyalists the chaos boys just get preset colours and armor and that's it, the in-deph customization is completely lacking and missing for them. Also levelling in it works in a way that you just get a higher number on your report card, you also unlock new weapons and winning X amount of matches gets you new armour cosmetics, which also can be earned in Co-Op mode. There are no perks, no means to change attachment or flat out upgrade your weapons in PvP, those things exist in co-op but are absent here and that's honestly for the better, it means there's no perks one can unlock to give unfair advantages over others as in SM1 and since gear is equal there's no max level guy who has a bolter that does 6x more damage than yours, those all exists still but are just for the co-op strike missions where you have light rpg elements in which you get to further fine tune,upgrade and buff up your class and weapons. PvE Co-Op Multiplayer Very similar in terms of design to dev's previous game World War Z , you run through 6 special missions that are happening alongside the main narrative and you keep replaying these missions earning XP and gear for your marines and weapons to level up and get stronger, however it does suffer a bit from enemies becoming a lil too spongy perhaps on the last difficulties. More Info: Think of it like doing Left 4 Dead campaigns that you just keep replaying for fun but also in this case to level up, earn new gear or get your current gear to become stronger, because it's not just your class that levels up and unlocks various perks but also your weapons get stronger too, unlocking stronger versions, new weapon perks with even new cosmetics to boot to showcase that they are better. You play as one of the two other squads in the game that under-take missions whilst TITUs and his team are doing their own thing. Though here the game does become gear n level depended but i would argue it is still possible to do the 3rd and 4th difficulties (hardest ones) with the right classes and equipment set up even if under levelled to a degree. It's honestly an enjoyable chaotic romp that i do strongly recommend playing with 1 buddy at least, cause with randos it's just not the same fun. Final Note : Despite some stumbles in design, optimisation woes and lacking in PvP content, the game delivers a very much worthy sequel to Space Marine 1 and i am loving it a lot despite some of its flaws.",pretti good definit perfect come flaw well done sequel first game ive enjoy lot visual game visual aspect look great especi consid absolut chao see happen screen mani enemi swarm thing blow even small attent detail exist fact get mud stain armour blood ofc go marshi part planet look damn good due perform somewhat shoddi scale need soften imag peopl cant stand tempor soft imag happi optimizaiton good entir terribl need modern mid rang machin run solidish fp even need use scale tech got ryzen midrang set get today get averag fp usual mix highmedium dlss qualiti mode scale also shader stutter problem load time sometim pain long there def optimis work done still new gameplay addit much space marin expand upon part get time dodg parri might take bit get use parri window gener that due fact your almost alway deal utter chao screen mani thing attack add challeng dodg parri campaign hour long full player coop support difficulti easi normal veteran angel death overr realli good especi final act start lil sosomor infoi play solo veteran initi experi bit lukewarm first mission didnt take long get especi sinc campaign get better progress earli mission frequent reoccur issu present your play solo certain segment feel like theyr meant two ai partner share singular brain cell exampl use flame thrower push back swarm tini lil insect whilst deal lot rang enemi complet object problem flamer take primari weapon away your pistol rang enemi plu enemi solo mode tend focu solo player two ai partner situat feel bit bad howev start becom less problem mid point campaign start feel like put thought make enjoy play solo campaign whole realli damn good end apart stumbl design much feel like coop campaign option solo mode time time epic doesnt stay welcom end pretti satisfi note spectacular final act fight incred kick pvp multiplay solid pvp experi kinda class citizen packag balanc quirk design might get notableannoy play improv pvp larg due dedic server peer peer constant lag host migrat addit abil add decent bit spicemor infojust like across map game mode annihil tdm seiz grounddomin kothlik mode class light map varieti offer varieti term game play style class one uniqu abil use frontal shield devast heavi aoe chapter banner heal peopl armour bulwark class brief invis sniper forthso far dug fair bit mele notibl weaker compar pvp potenti partial due lag problem offer extra protect lagteleport assault marin due bad netcod would often ignor half damag threw em game also team depend certain class work togeth realli well bulwark shield guy power sword shield absorb rang damag surprisingli forev basic unless get hit behind boot deploy aoe armor regen everyon combin heavi devast class got combo deal rang cqc target well cover other weak offer armor heal bulwark frontal shield heavi devast keep fightit half bad matter fact somewhat addict first two week releas balanc quirk bulwark turtl player flash nade spam suck fun ithowev wish wish perhap instead wish chao marin could properli customis unlik loyalist chao boy get preset colour armor that indeph custom complet lack miss also level work way get higher number report card also unlock new weapon win x amount match get new armour cosmet also earn coop mode perk mean chang attach flat upgrad weapon pvp thing exist coop absent that honestli better mean there perk one unlock give unfair advantag other sinc gear equal there max level guy bolter damag exist still coop strike mission light rpg element get fine tuneupgrad buff class weapon pve coop multiplay similar term design dev previou game world war z run special mission happen alongsid main narr keep replay mission earn xp gear marin weapon level get stronger howev suffer bit enemi becom lil spongi perhap last difficulti info think like left dead campaign keep replay fun also case level earn new gear get current gear becom stronger class level unlock variou perk also weapon get stronger unlock stronger version new weapon perk even new cosmet boot showcas better play one two squad game undertak mission whilst titu team thing though game becom gear n level depend would argu still possibl difficulti hardest one right class equip set even level degre honestli enjoy chaotic romp strongli recommend play buddi least caus rando fun final note despit stumbl design optimis woe lack pvp content game deliv much worthi sequel space marin love lot despit flaw

"I really tried to enjoy this game, and even spend a little on the Meta Pass to support it, given the number of hours I put into a ""free"" game. But ultimately, Once Human just isn't for me, at least not yet.I was expecting this to be a Survival Crafting / Base Building game with shooter elements. But really, this is a shooter game with crafting and building elements. And that crafting / building is absolutely Early Access quality. Random scavenging gives random loot that somehow provides all my crafting needs, so long as I pick everything up. So there is little need for targeted resource hunting or exploration after the first few dozen hours of gameplay. Good luck getting roofs to snap to walls. And God-forbid you try to relocate your territory after building anything more interesting than a wooden box.Combat is okay, but there is little support for anything other than firearms. My dreams of being Kirito in Gun Gale are dashed. More seriously, hit detection for precision bow shots is endlessly frustrating and inconsistent, making every attempt at stealth missions an exercise in futility (or a two-hour endeavor to clear a single settlement for resources that can be found elsewhere).This is not a bad game. But it definitely should be treated as Early Access, not a full-release. I will probably come back to this game in the future after some hearty Quality of Life Improvements geared towards us solo survival crafting players.

"2022 This is the best souls like experience From Software could ever grace us. From the very moment you start in Elden Ring you are introduced to the new and interesting world and it just becomes ever more confusing the more you play! You meet tons of characters on your journey who may be of service, betray you, give you a chuckle, or just call you out that you have no maidens. There are tons of bosses and challenges for you to face even after you beat the game because of how expansive this game is. I am just going to put some good things and bad things I have with the game as I do want to specify a big issue I have. First I want to start off with the good: The world design is fantastic as every area feels different from the rest. Certain places give you a sense of adventure while some may give you a sense of dread and fear of dying in .2 seconds. The weapons and armor are some of the best in the souls series. The combat is much more fluid than the previous souls game. Horse combat and gameplay is a very nice addition to the game. Most if not all the characters you meet feel unique and confusing as they all speak tounge. Now I could go on and on about how good this game is but I just need to point out my biggest issue. There are tons of reused bosses in this game. In addition, I have seen regular enemies become bosses later. Worst of all, there are bosses that you fight one on one and then they are reused as a duo boss. The three biggest culprits are the dragons, godskin noble, AND THOSE CRUCIBLE KNIGHTS WHICH YOU FIGHT 7 DIFFERENT TIMES. These of course are just only a few examples of reused bosses. Just a side complaint here is the performance in some areas of the game. I know this will probably be fixed later in a patch but man those stutters are common and have affected a boss fight or two. But these performance issues didn't happen all the time to hamper my overall experience.In conclusion, Elden Ring is phenomenal and I do have my personal complaints of the game but at the end of the day if you enjoy souls like games that From Software releases I think you should pick this one up.

"2019 I originally played this game back when it was still in closed beta, when I gained access to it by bothering a Valve employee (sorry, Jeep). Back then I loved it, it felt great and performed great and everything just made sense. Since then, Valve took over the game where Hidden Path left off and only built on it - adding more depth to mechanics and gunplay and even movement. I fell out with the game around then, as the focus shifted to being a little bit too competitive for my tastes (yes, I am a casual, and I'm ok with that).Over time I saw more and more flaws with the game that turned me off. Weird premium passes, sprays that cost money, skins that cost money, lootboxes. Even gloves became a microtransaction. While I'm not anti-microtransaction (I understand that long-lasting games have to make money somehow), I felt Valve's approach to these microtransactions became increasingly anti-consumer. And that's what prevented me from coming back.But then something crazy happened: they shoehorned in a battle royale mode to cash in on a craze and made the game free-to-play. I thought this would be the final nail in the game's coffin, as I reinstalled it to ""see how bad it was"".Except it was really, really good.Danger Zone became my way back to Counter-Strike. I ignored the skins and sprays and stickers and gloves and who knows what else, and started playing with my friends and having a genuinely good time in this so-called tacked-on game mode. The mode is very tightly designed. Matches are kept small and quick, solving the big issue in other BR games where you spend 20 minutes looting copy/pasted houses in a map the size of Texas, only to be wiped out by some screeching 13 year olds. Now you spend 2 minutes looting unique environments in a map the size of a small island, only to be wiped out by some screeching 13 year olds. The small matches also meant quick queue times! Plus, they built a host of battle royale mechanics around CS's mechanics, instead of the other way around like every other game.And then they removed three player squads, for some unknown reason. Suddenly, I can't play with my friends, only a single friend. They even removed solo play, and began matching solo players against duos. This also resulted in much longer queue times, as people stopped playing it due to it no longer supporting squads and because of the weird new matchmaking rules. I'm not sure what drove this decision, but it actually did turn Danger Zone into the final nail in the coffin.

"To call the game ""released"", a long and fairly good quality beta test must pass (with a large team of competent testers for such a large open world and such a large number of mechanics), but when the company starts releasing in a hurry due to the fact that some group of sponsors or whoever rather started to get off their investments ...Then as a ""game"" we get a disgusting mixture of monotonous gameplay, with constant lags, bugs, inconsistencies with descriptions, broken crafting elements and not only, broken perks, absolutely raw events, illogical calculation and damage systems of buffs, and much more. I haven't seen such a RAW game in a long time. Apparently, we are at the stage called ""welcome to the era of lazy and inexperienced gamedev without good skills(exmple: in optimisation/devops/put here what you experienced from nowadays games) and probably incapable of broad-mind game design.""After spending almost 500 hours in the game, I can confidently say that, in the next month I will write a huge bug report without emotions but with raw information. Aaand, will monitor(gona post it elsewhere) the response to it and further actions regarding CRITICAL moments affecting the game experience EXTREMELY negatively for a lot of players(as i put some work to speak almost with everyone on my server to get feedback by this topic, and it's not good... if i say it soft...). Bottom line:At the moment, the game should add a BETA marker. Otherwise, presenting this abomination as a finished product is a deliberate deception, in my humble opinion - in my humble opinion, someone had an irresistible desire to release the product as soon as possible, the reasons, judging by what I realized during the game, are very prosaic. The potential of the game is huge. If not for all the bad things that it has, it would be just amazing with a competent dev approach. But we have what we have and it's very sad.I'm saying all this as a person with 6 years of experience in devops and 8 years in development (2 of which with django python, 4 with C, 1 with C++, 1 with ruby). I KNOW how it can be, I UNDERSTAND how it should be, and I've seen many times how NOT to do it, so the game is about 40% how NOT to do it.P.S. and ye, servers made of paper, working just terrible, load balancing on stone age level.

"2023 I've really enjoyed this series but I can't recommend this game, despite it being its ultimate conclusion; what should be every warhammer fan's wet dream. It just wouldn't fit my ethics to do so.To put concisely, it just doesn't make sense to try and get into this series anymore at this point. The way this game's dlc works seems reasonable at first, with none of it *technically* being required, but this is just not true when we consider that even if you enjoyed only one faction; if that faction wasn't in this game you are buying an entire other video game to play that faction in this game. It's a sort of nickle and diming that doesnt feel as bad to someone whose been playing all along but the barrier to having a full faction roster in 2023 for a new player is beyond reasonable. This game is 60 dollars, and then asks you to pay at least 60 more to play some of its most iconic factions to their fullest. This is before we even get into how multiplayer adds extra pressure to this. The base versions of every faction are inherently incomplete and far less viable in multiplayer. If you're a skaven player, you're buying two games and somewhere around three dlcs to play your whole army. These expansion packs are another *technically* worth it sort of thing because beyond units they have unique campaigns but i just cant actually ask someone to do that. To top it all off, 3 is probably one of the least polished versions of the game to date, rife with bugs and poor decision choices; some of which that date back to the first game. Sieges are STILL not fun, the unique smaller map campaign is still annoying to play, if you bought the beastmen you still dont have the little mini campaign their dlc justifed its cost with from the first game, the AI is still unacceptably easy to cheat against, the strategic and empire building side of the game is still inferior to previous games, unit balance is still unsatisfying and skewed towards certain monsters and ranged units, and the new dlc model is the worst value and most toxic yet.Shadows of change upped the scale of lord packs to three new subfactions rather than two alongside a MASSIVE price increase and its just not worth it. Interestingly enough having more factions involved makes it feel even worse, because in this instance I only play one of the factions. So if I wanted to play kislev to its fullest id have to go buy the most expensive dlc of its kind while only enjoying less than a third of its value. Warhammer 3 needs a serious come-to-jesus moment on its current model because its only good at leaching off of existing long-term customers and at this point it's been this way so long I can't deny its at least mostly on purpose. I don't think we started on this road on purpose or out of malice, but we have had several opportunities to change course and still we go on. At this point in warhammer 2's lifespan we were getting several entirely new factions including ones that were only ever described through lore and side-games like the vampire coast. What gets me is that not only is it bad value for the customer it feels like extra work for the devs. Making three subfactions instead of two means they now need to make three new entire systems, and they now need to make one more massive big budget big ♥♥♥♥ box seller unit and its art assets which I feel is a massive amount of the time and money put into these packs, becasue they DO look amazing. They all do. This game is beautiful when the lighting doesn't mess it up. So why waste that time and money and dedication making something worse that people feel bad paying for because there's just only so much any one person wants to spend on a single dlc pack.If you're a warhammer fan, im sorry but don't tread here. You'll spend only slightly more money and make more friends collecting an actual army of minis and playing at your local game store.",ive realli enjoy seri cant recommend game despit ultim conclus everi warhamm fan wet dream wouldnt fit ethic soto put concis doesnt make sens tri get seri anymor point way game dlc work seem reason first none technic requir true consid even enjoy one faction faction wasnt game buy entir video game play faction game sort nickl dime doesnt feel bad someon whose play along barrier full faction roster new player beyond reason game dollar ask pay least play icon faction fullest even get multiplay add extra pressur base version everi faction inher incomplet far less viabl multiplay your skaven player your buy two game somewher around three dlc play whole armi expans pack anoth technic worth sort thing beyond unit uniqu campaign cant actual ask someon top probabl one least polish version game date rife bug poor decis choic date back first game sieg still fun uniqu smaller map campaign still annoy play bought beastmen still dont littl mini campaign dlc justif cost first game ai still unaccept easi cheat strateg empir build side game still inferior previou game unit balanc still unsatisfi skew toward certain monster rang unit new dlc model worst valu toxic yetshadow chang up scale lord pack three new subfact rather two alongsid massiv price increas worth interestingli enough faction involv make feel even wors instanc play one faction want play kislev fullest id go buy expens dlc kind enjoy less third valu warhamm need seriou cometojesu moment current model good leach exist longterm custom point way long cant deni least mostli purpos dont think start road purpos malic sever opportun chang cours still go point warhamm lifespan get sever entir new faction includ one ever describ lore sidegam like vampir coast get bad valu custom feel like extra work dev make three subfact instead two mean need make three new entir system need make one massiv big budget big box seller unit art asset feel massiv amount time money put pack becasu look amaz game beauti light doesnt mess wast time money dedic make someth wors peopl feel bad pay there much one person want spend singl dlc packif your warhamm fan im sorri dont tread youll spend slightli money make friend collect actual armi mini play local game store

"2022 Elden Ring is an incredible open world experience for those who enjoy Fromsoft's approach to RPG games. The difficulty level is similar to previous titles by this developer such as Dark Souls. However, it is approachable to new players as there are many options available to make the game accessible difficulty-wise to those who don't want as much of a challenge. The game looks great, feels great, but there are some performance issues that are yet to be worked out.

"2023 Over a thousand hours combined in the Warhammer Total War series. More in other total wars.I want to add a counter point to the review-bombing happening with the recent Shadows of Change DLC. Yes, the value for money of the latest DLC is not great and has angered the community. Yes, CA has been slow to fix some long-standing known bugs with a patch cycle that some people wish was quicker. However, the above does not detract from the extraordinary scope of the game that is available. If you are a fan of either the Warhammer Fantasy world or the idea of a 4X style game with fantasy elements, then TW:WHIII is the definitive experience. The base game is much improved since the launch of it over a year ago. The immortal empires map, which is the combined world map of all 3 games, has been made available to owners of just TW:WHIII.

"2023 This game is still riddled with issues and bugs a year and a half after release. Fine, it's a complex game building on 8 years of previous work, I could understand them struggling to pin everything down.I cannot understand why they charge the price of many full games (Looking outside the AAA sphere) for 1.5 lord packs - which used to be 1/3rd of the price they're trying to charge. Of course, there is massive inflation especially in the country CA is based - this does not excuse doubling the price over the expected for the value.Until now I have bought every single DLC. It's unlikely I'll buy more if they continue like this, and I certainly won't be purchasing any future games.",game still riddl issu bug year half releas fine complex game build year previou work could understand struggl pin everyth downi understand charg price mani full game look outsid aaa sphere lord pack use price theyr tri charg cours massiv inflat especi countri ca base excus doubl price expect valueuntil bought everi singl dlc unlik ill buy continu like certainli wont purchas futur game

"2022 Elden Ring reinvents the open world in the same way Breath of the Wild does. By breaking all the trends associated with modern open-world games. No hand-holding, no quest markers, no collectible-based progression, and no copy and pasted zones. You can explore any part of the world from the beginning, nothing (but a few tough enemies) is stopping you from exploring the farthest reaches of the world from the get-go. Build diversity is at an all-time high. With a plethora of play styles available, and with a generous ability to respec (around halfway through the game). I've played three wildly different characters, and each time I was able to make my idea come to life easily.Combat feels as fluent as ever. Strength weapons feel meaty and have a huge weight behind them. While dex-based weapons are fast and fluid.

"2022 Product received for free CS:GO review from a free account Counter-strike: Global Offensive is a game in which two teams (One Terrorist, and the other Counter Terrorist) try to prevail against the other. The Terrorists try to plant the bomb at one of two sites or wipe out the other team, and the Counter terrorists try to stop the terrorists from accomplishing their tasks.Pros:Can be free to play (with limitations)- If you choose to play CS without upgrading your account, you can still play all of the game modes. It is actually pretty good for a free game. You cannot receive drops or a rank however. Steam cards are also not available to free accountsGood multiplayer game- CS can be played with teams of 5 friends if you queue up in competitive mode. Cs also has the largest player base of any game on steam, so there are always people to play with.Game is updated regularly- CS receives updates on the regular, and operations are added yearly (as of the date of this review)Number of hackers lessened- In my experience, the number of hackers in this game has been greatly reduced over the years. I am playing on a new free to play account (an alt) to test this, and it does seem to hold upCons:hacking is still prevalent in csgoThe ranking system is hard to understand- You may lose a game and de-rank, then go on to win 5 games with no rank up. You need to be patient with the ELO systemThere are not many gamemodes- To be fair, they have been updating cs and introduced things like short comp matchesOverall, csgo is a fun game, and if you dont care about getting a rank, a free to play account works well for your needs. I initially played casual for the first 2 years of my csgo gameplay (back in 2015). If you dont care about comp and ranks, this is essentially what a free account can offer you. You can get into games, and even play competitive mode these days without it being ranked. It is a fun game, and I do recommend it :)",product receiv free csgo review free account counterstrik global offens game two team one terrorist counter terrorist tri prevail terrorist tri plant bomb one two site wipe team counter terrorist tri stop terrorist accomplish tasksproscan free play limit choos play cs without upgrad account still play game mode actual pretti good free game receiv drop rank howev steam card also avail free accountsgood multiplay game cs play team friend queue competit mode cs also largest player base game steam alway peopl play withgam updat regularli cs receiv updat regular oper ad yearli date reviewnumb hacker lessen experi number hacker game greatli reduc year play new free play account alt test seem hold upconshack still preval csgoth rank system hard understand may lose game derank go win game rank need patient elo systemther mani gamemod fair updat cs introduc thing like short comp matchesoveral csgo fun game dont care get rank free play account work well need initi play casual first year csgo gameplay back dont care comp rank essenti free account offer get game even play competit mode day without rank fun game recommend
"I wishlisted this game because the trailer and screenshots reminded me of The Secret World. I downloaded this game after watching a streamer play for 10 minutes and realizing it was a blend of The Secret World, Rust, and Palworld. This is one of those games you sit down to play for an hour or two and then look at the clock 14 hours later and you haven’t moved. It’s so fun. My only complaint is some rough FPS drops when you’re near a cluster of player territories, but apparently the official launcher has better performance than Steam right now so that’s an option too. Oh, and yes, servers wipe every six weeks so don’t be surprised by that. I’ve played many hours of Rust and Diablo and seasonal wipes are not as bad as people make them out to be. Honestly, after going through so many resets, I actually prefer them now. Also there’s a dinosaur costume and an outfit that looks like cowgirl Beyoncé.",wishlist game trailer screenshot remind secret world download game watch streamer play minut realiz blend secret world rust palworld one game sit play hour two look clock hour later havent move fun complaint rough fp drop your near cluster player territori appar offici launcher better perform steam right that option oh ye server wipe everi six week dont surpris ive play mani hour rust diablo season wipe bad peopl make honestli go mani reset actual prefer also there dinosaur costum outfit look like cowgirl beyonc

"2023 This game is a lifesaver; having recently purchased a house that does not easily accommodate the space needed for a game of Age of Sigmar or 40k, and having small children that will express their curiosity towards my ineptly painted models with reckless abandon, we've played an obscene amount of this instead. It's not perfect, but it's tons of fun and allows for a impressive variety of play given how dissimilar the factions are from each other. Immortal Empires really shows this off, as does our favorite activity: Battle modes with points determining the army lists.I consider this to be the ultimate fusion of Total War as a franchise and Warhammer as a franchise, and I would be hard-pressed to name a strategy game I enjoy more, as these two seem to be made for each other. The grit and variety of the Warhammer setting, bringing a plethora of unit options over the typical Total War PC game, and the focus and grand scale of the Total War skin really hones in on the best aspects of the tabletop version of Warhammer: the lore and the depth of faction options.You can distill the essence of this game to the following quote from one of my partner's favorite Robot Chicken skits: ""I beat up the guy who owned this stuff, so now it's mine.

"2023 To CA: Please fix the outstanding bugs BEFORE you work on and introduce DLCs worth half the price of the base game. 2nd Update: Interacting with sea events crashes the game, roughly one in three events. Sailing straight into a literal crash. Update, a week later: Was battling in the realm of chaos and while flying, my daemon prince started sinking - lower and lower, THROUGH the lava and kept going, eventually disappearing from the screen itself. Could not use him for the remainder of the fight. 1 year on, despite thousands of reviews on this issue, this game still has significant bugs. Had a strong Daemon prince hero that could easily take out 5 stacks of weaker enemies by himself (which i was doing, flying around the map, crash landing for massive damage, flying back up before the stack could recover). Until the game told me that ""flying units can't hold the ground and you have to land or surrender the territory"". So i did (the enemy was battered enough for me to clean up the rest on foot). That didnt do a thing - the game kept spamming LAND OR LOSE and my hero eventually died because the game forced low morale on him (daemons disintegrate on low morale).",ca pleas fix outstand bug work introduc dlc worth half price base game updat interact sea event crash game roughli one three event sail straight liter crash updat week later battl realm chao fli daemon princ start sink lower lower lava kept go eventu disappear screen could use remaind fight year despit thousand review issu game still signific bug strong daemon princ hero could easili take stack weaker enemi fli around map crash land massiv damag fli back stack could recov game told fli unit cant hold ground land surrend territori enemi batter enough clean rest foot didnt thing game kept spam land lose hero eventu die game forc low moral daemon disintegr low moral

"2020 This game will ruin any ambitions you have in real life. This game will consume all your energy, money and happiness. You might start as a casual player, enjoying the fun parts of the game. But the more you play, the more you descend into this pit of pure mental torture. This game will make even the most calm person into a raging toxic human being in some point of playing. The sheer toxicity this game causes even suppasses neurosis of the traditional road rage.You're better off hot railing meth than playing this godforsaken game.For every moment of fun and accomplishment you get 5 moments of desperation in this addicting hell hole.Now when it comes to skins. The marketing and hype for skins is absolutely incredible. Valve did a good job creating a platform, where having expensive items that do jack'all is considered that of a higher social status, somehow similar to buying expensive branded clothes. Of course a lot of people don't care about skins. But let me tell you. Once you start getting into the game more. You start seeing yourself improving as you go on. And you will absolutely spend money on skins rather than buying a new game or something different on steam. It's an ego trap. Everyone thinks they are on a road to becoming the best player, which gives them a justification for spending money on useless ♥♥♥♥, and for the more mentaly unstable individuals... Gamble with those items, so that they get stuck in this loop of wanting to return to their base value by gambling more. Creating gambling addicts disguised as videogame players- What is even more damaging, is the fact that valve doesn't enforce the ratings of their games, even to the extent of microtransactions.

Unfortunately, the state of the game is actually poor And the recent patches and DLCs have made it worse. This upset is exacerbated by the cost increases and poorly worded responses from the company.

Total War: Warhammer 3 is a culmination of all the previous Warhammer games mashed into a single game. Despite negative community feedback they have been putting a lot of attention to detail and love into the game and it's clear to see. Is the game perfect? No most games are not. It's important for a community to give good feedback when a Studio is going in a direction that we don't like. That being said I recommend this game and believe it's well worth the money. You can easily play the game without purchasing any other dlc and have mountains of content. Not the mention the multitude of free DLC lords available to download.,total war warhamm culmin previou warhamm game mash singl game despit neg commun feedback put lot attent detail love game clear see game perfect game import commun give good feedback studio go direct dont like said recommend game believ well worth money easili play game without purchas dlc mountain content mention multitud free dlc lord avail download

"I'm just going to type about the game because I am not a game reviewer, nor do I have expertise on Game Development. However, I've played video games consistently since the early 2000's. This game is good looking. The cinematic elements of the game are a nice touch but it doesn't make up for the fact that the fighting mechanics are not done well. The common enemies are eliminated by button mashing. While the elite enemies tend to have heavy attacks that you dodge once and then spam mash light attack until their HP is gone. This is early game that I'm talking about so it might be possible to have other abilities later on. This review has come to be after I fought the second boss (The water snake noble guy) and can't beat him. Is it because I don't want to be patient? Absolutely I don't want to be patient! But his attacks (I felt the same way about the first boss) are too difficult to read, and I spend my time spam dodging until he's done. I've played and beaten both Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring (DLC Included) and this game is just mechanically clunky. The fights just feel like you take turns attacking. There is not a defensive strategy early on. I can't block (except archers' arrows but I've only run into 2 of them), I can't parry, and I can't counter.The game looks good, feels ok, but overall the fighting aspect (at least early on) is mechanically impossible to actually feel like a Martial Arts Monkey. I think my only issues is how narrow and closed in the beginning feels. I get that there isn't an open world aspect and that it is very linear. Which in games like Sekiro are fine because it felt like there was some level of exploration. This game locks you into a path that says ""Get good"" but cares more about creating a challenging Fromsoft experience without the vast equipment or abilities that Fromsoft gifts to their players with their choices of character creation. Again, not a game reviewer, just a frustrated gamer that spent $60 on another game that doesn't feel fine tuned. (just feels like with all the open world games nowadays, companies don't know how to create efficient linear maps).I am not returning this and do plan on trying to beat it, but not because I love the video game, but because I love video games.

"2022 There isn't much new to add about this game at this point so I'll try (and fail) to be concise (which is hard because the hype I've had for this game in the past years is immesurable).Are you a Souls veteran? Welcome to the best souls by a long shot. Like, DS1 will always be in my heart but it's completely surreal the amount of joy, entertainment, ""wow"" moments like the very first time you reach Anor Londo in DS1, Drangleic Castle in DS2 or Irithyll in DS3. This game has that but every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 15 minutes. Literally pick everything you liked about previous titles and Elden Ring easily has that and improved.Are you new to the Souls series? Welcome to the modern gaming experience of your life. For the first time ever we have a product that is overhyped during its development and not only it met its expectations, but somehow exceeded them. Elden Ring is the culmination of everything FromSoft has learned for the past 10 years, all put together into their first open world game. Experience freedom, mystery, danger, an absurd amount of content and varied environments, a savage attention to detail and overall one of the most beautiful and dense open worlds this market has to offer.If you feel intimidated by the Difficult tag that precedes all FromSoft's titles, let me tell you that Elden Ring is the most accessible game of them all. And by accessible I don't mean easiest. While you were forced to stomp on an area/boss in previous games, this is an open world. Feeling stuck? Just turn around, keep exploring and get stronger (and boi, there IS content to explore)! Unlike your generic big titles, don't go full unga unga here. This is a game that you can perfectly beat by simply hack-n-slashing, but it encourages you to try your available resources to make fights much more managable; it treats you as a smart person. And this is something very important that I feel many newcomers ignore which has been applying since their old games. There are always many ways to make fights easier, or even trivialize them. Read your items, use internet tips to help you out, ask friends or summon them to aid you. The game encourages you to do so! ""Easy Mode"" exists but it's not a setting option you can turn on/off; you need to craft it by playing smart.I also want to highlight that Elden Ring is not perfect; a project this large will always have some flaws and there are many things I would've changed. Some examples are: some copypasted minor bosses across dungeons; some QoL improvements; better balancing (especially on the second half of the game)... The point here though is to say it the other way around: it is unbelievable Elden Ring has so few flaws given the scale of the game.

"2022 I'm a total noob when it comes to Souls-Games. Usually I play RPGs on easy mode to enjoy the story in peace.Obviously there is no proper easy mode in Elden Ring, but the game allows you to play it in your own pace.I literally spent the first 12-14 hours just riding around on my horse which I named Dolly, picked up flowers & only killed some easy enemies. The more I played the more I got confident & noticed that I'm able to kill some small dungeon bosses, because the game allows you to level up without going for the big bosses. When I felt strong enough I went for my first story boss & it was fun, not too easy, not too difficult. Like that's the great part of Elden Ring: you don't have to be this awesome Souls-Veteran to be able to enjoy the game. You can just take your time with everything, explore the beautiful world from the get go & just enjoy the view & smaller bosses.The game doesn't push you to kill a certain difficult boss in order to get somewhere ingame. You're not forced to farm the same enemies for hours on end until you're strong enough to continue your journey. You can just keep exploring & will eventually level up in the mean time. & if you're not getting any further with a specific boss, then you can just leave it be for now & do hundreds of other things instead.I would also like to mention that the open world is done really good! You're able to explore every single corner & the game even rewards you for being curious. There are no useless areas in which you waste your time. You're always getting some kind of reward everywhere you go.",im total noob come soulsgam usual play rpg easi mode enjoy stori peaceobvi proper easi mode elden ring game allow play pacei liter spent first hour ride around hors name dolli pick flower kill easi enemi play got confid notic im abl kill small dungeon boss game allow level without go big boss felt strong enough went first stori boss fun easi difficult like that great part elden ring dont awesom soulsveteran abl enjoy game take time everyth explor beauti world get go enjoy view smaller bossesth game doesnt push kill certain difficult boss order get somewher ingam your forc farm enemi hour end your strong enough continu journey keep explor eventu level mean time your get specif boss leav hundr thing insteadi would also like mention open world done realli good your abl explor everi singl corner game even reward curiou useless area wast time your alway get kind reward everywher go

This final, magnum opus is no different. We're simply in the first few bars, leading up to the crescendo. Some complain about the way they main campaign works, but there are plenty of mods out there to disable that and give you other objectives if that's what you're looking for.

"2022 I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I have hundreds, maybe even thousands of hours playing Total War games,and WH3 has the POTENTIAL to be the BEST game of the franchise so far. It could be the best game I've ever played...but it isn't. Here's why:1. Please fix the AI Undead. It is ridiculous how fast they reinforce and multiply. For example, I made several valiant stands against undead sieges in my towns, where I would totally destroy several units during the fighting, but it was pointless because even though the units showed that they were destroyed at the end of the battle, they would magically reappear at the beginning of the very next turn virtually unscathed. RIDICULOUS and FRUSTRATING! 2. Ambushed while my army is in camp mode. This is even crazier. If my army is encamped and not moving, can somebody pleeeease tell me how in the H.E.L.L. they can be suddenly ambushed walking around? I could see if maybe the camp had suddenly came under attack, and there was a battle map for that. But if the army is STATIC how can it be out walking around in the most vulnerable nonsensical formation that absolutely no commander who is worth his weight in pig dung would march his army out in? They really have to fix this. Because it makes ZERO sense at all. 3. Just take out the boost the winds of magic gamble feature. Has this thing ever boosted the winds in anybody's favor when the difficulty setting is on High or above? REALLY? REALLY?4. It seems like the evil factions are all one faction once the player's faction becomes a little powerful. I played as The Empire and Kislev and both times Orcs, Undead, Demons, and Norsicans would walk over, through, around and on top of each other to come after me. This makes no sense, especially when the factions are not allies. I could go on, but these are a few of the main things that really make the game soooo frustrating that it's hard to enjoy all the fun I'm having.

"2023 Total War: Warhammer 3 is a great game, but I can't recommend it in good conscience due to the recent DLC price controversy. The new Shadows of Change DLC is priced at $24.99, which is a 150% increase over the price of previous lord packs. This is especially egregious considering that the DLC only adds two new legendary lords and a handful of new units.Creative Assembly has defended the price increase by saying that it reflects the increased cost of development. However, I find this argument to be unconvincing. The previous lord packs were already well-priced, and I don't see why the cost of development should have increased so dramatically in the past year.The DLC price controversy is just the latest in a series of problems that have plagued Warhammer 3 since its launch. The game has been plagued by bugs and performance issues, and Creative Assembly has been slow to address these issues. The developer has also been criticized for its lack of communication with the community.I hope that Creative Assembly will reconsider the price of next DLC. Until then, I can't recommend Warhammer 3 to anyone. The DLC price increase is a slap in the face to the fans who have already supported Warhammer 3 and overall, the DLC price controversy is a major black mark on Warhammer 3. It is a shame that such a great game has been marred by such a greedy business decision.",total war warhamm great game cant recommend good conscienc due recent dlc price controversi new shadow chang dlc price increas price previou lord pack especi egregi consid dlc add two new legendari lord hand new unitscr assembl defend price increas say reflect increas cost develop howev find argument unconvinc previou lord pack alreadi wellpric dont see cost develop increas dramat past yearth dlc price controversi latest seri problem plagu warhamm sinc launch game plagu bug perform issu creativ assembl slow address issu develop also critic lack commun communityi hope creativ assembl reconsid price next dlc cant recommend warhamm anyon dlc price increas slap face fan alreadi support warhamm overal dlc price controversi major black mark warhamm shame great game mar greedi busi decis

"2021 CS:GO review from a free account Counter-strike: Global Offensive is a game in which two teams (One Terrorist, and the other Counter Terrorist) try to prevail against the other. The Terrorists try to plant the bomb at one of two sites or wipe out the other team, and the Counter terrorists try to stop the terrorists from accomplishing their tasks. Pros: Can be free to play (with limitations)- If you choose to play CS without upgrading your account, you can still play all of the game modes. It is actually pretty good for a free game. You cannot receive drops or a rank however. Steam cards are also not available to free accountsGood multiplayer game- CS can be played with teams of 5 friends if you queue up in competitive mode. Cs also has the largest player base of any game on steam, so there are always people to play with.Game is updated regularly- CS receives updates on the regular, and operations are added yearly (as of the date of this review)Number of hackers lessened- In my experience, the number of hackers in this game has been greatly reduced over the years. I am playing on a new free to play account (an alt) to test this, and it does seem to hold up Cons: hacking is still prevalent in csgoThe ranking system is hard to understand- You may lose a game and de-rank, then go on to win 5 games with no rank up. You need to be patient with the ELO systemThere are not many gamemodes- To be fair, they have been updating cs and introduced things like short comp matches Overall, csgo is a fun game, and if you dont care about getting a rank, a free to play account works well for your needs. I initially played casual for the first 2 years of my csgo gameplay (back in 2015). If you dont care about comp and ranks, this is essentially what a free account can offer you. You can get into games, and even play competitive mode these days without it being ranked.

"2022 As anyone following the game knows, it launched in a bad state. The campaign was annoying and one-note, the bugs were frequent and impactful, and the performance was terrible. Thankfully, the game has been slowly getting fixed and once modding support was released we could remove the worst parts of it.The game that is now available is in a much better state. The game has recently received the ""Immortal Empires"" update which has added a full world map that doesn't have the annoying campaign mechanics, a bunch of the more questionable design aspects have started being fixed, the performance is significantly better, and owners of the previous games can now access (almost) all of the old game's content in this one.Is it perfect? Hell no. Its still super buggy (although the bugs are more singular features not triggering and graphics issues and less gameplay breaking issues), the balance is off, and there are far too many siege battles. Despite all of this, I would now suggest buying the game. There is enough content in the base game to entertain you for quite a while, it can incorporate the previous two games (and all of their DLC) to give a frankly ridiculous amount of content, and the management change since launch seems to have fixed the development pipeline.---Well, that's what I said at launch. It turns out that they have not fixed their pipeline. New patches come out at a glacial pace, and even when they do come out they break more than they fix. Poor Nakai still can't recruit his most important units, the Brettonia update simply didn't work, and the map is so laggy that some people cannot run the game after turn 50!I'm not going to go into the price of the latest DLC, its overpriced and we all know this. However, the game just isn't in a state I can recommend. Is there a metric ton of content? Yes! Is a lot of it fun? Yes! Is it in a state I can recommend? Not even close. When I wrote my last review, I had hope that the game would overcome its poor launch state and become something fantastic. I just don't have that hope anymore.If you want to get the game, do it but make sure to get the unofficial patch before you even boot it up.

"2022 After playing 9 hours of Elden Ring, I am going to give it a thumbs up. Despite the horrible performance issues, I'm not really getting great performance on a 3070 paired with a 10700k and 32gb 3600mhz ram. This game is at its core a Dark Souls game, I've thoroughly enjoyed exploring Limgrave and the surrounding area and I think it does a good job of combining aspects from Sekiro and Dark Souls. The addition of a mount is cool although a lot of the time I just find myself running on foot exploring the area anyway.Would I recommend this to your average open world game enjoyer? Possibly not based on the fact that this is quite a punishing game for anyone who doesn't have the patience to repeat certain areas a few times until you get that satisfying W and get to where you need to go.I don't think I'm anywhere close to finishing this game, but so far I'm having a blast being someone who is a big fan of the soulsborne series. There are even some Dark Souls cameos that make an appearance.Overall thumbs up and it's a great game but it needs a lot of polish in terms of optimising. Also for anyone looking to purchase this, it is locked at 60fps so keep that in mind.",play hour elden ring go give thumb despit horribl perform issu im realli get great perform pair ram game core dark soul game ive thoroughli enjoy explor limgrav surround area think good job combin aspect sekiro dark soul addit mount cool although lot time find run foot explor area anywaywould recommend averag open world game enjoy possibl base fact quit punish game anyon doesnt patienc repeat certain area time get satisfi w get need goi dont think im anywher close finish game far im blast someon big fan soulsborn seri even dark soul cameo make appearanceoveral thumb great game need lot polish term optimis also anyon look purchas lock keep mind

"2023 Picture this: You make a game, it's LOVED all over in the world. You then make DLC for it with a bunch of content, new factions, new leaders, Etc. People buy it! Repeat this, make a new game, and tie the old game and it's DLC's to it.People end up buying that, the old game, the old DLC's and everything, which is a pretty big moneysink.You release a bunch of DLC for that aswell, and same thing. Now, you do this a Third time, but this time, you start lowering the amount of content in the DLC's, and raise the prices.Then you pretty much stop communicating with your players, release a dlc with lackluster mechanics costing a ton, get retaliation and you, as a company pretty much throw a hissy fit that people aren't buying the DLC and that they're getting tired of the cost going up and the content and quality is going down, and then pretty much just blame that ""We need more money and if you don't buy the DLCs we won't support the game anymore.""The three games, just the base games, cost 179.97 Euros.Now, All the DLC excluding Shadows Of Change is 244.29 Euros If I counted correctly.And they claim it's a Money issue. And This is just one of the branches in the Total War franchise.It's not a finance issue, It's greed.DLC overtime overshooting the game's price is normal when it is out for quite some time, but it's getting stupid when the 2 latest DLCS are almost just as much as the base game. Now, Forge Of The Chaos Dwarfs I can pretty much understand, Cause it came with lots of content so the price was justified in my eyes, but the latest DLC is just insane.Now I'm not saying the price for ALL The DLC'S are bad, hell, for warhammer II we got a bunch of FreeLC and most of the stuff was reasonable for their cost, but if we are going to go down the path they are taking us down now, it's not looking good. The price for the Two latest DLCS only is 49.98. That's 2 DLCS for 50 euros, when the base game is 60.Seeing how I haven't even mentioned the bugs that come with these DLC's, The rare patches for bugs and how they've pretty much THREATENED THEIR CUSTOMERS to shut down support for Warhammer III Cause we're getting tired of their stupid way of dealing with this, It's just enough. There's no more respect for us, the buyers, to be found in the company, Just a toxic view of us as wallets.If this is where we are heading, I will not be supporting the future of CA. It seems like the beauty that was Warhammer II and the good times that came with it isn't their view anymore, the vision they have for Warhammer III, and us, is just...Sad.You had such a beautiful thing going, and you decided to just start Killing it off like this.

"2014 It's hard to argue that this game is probably the best CS release since 1.6. Some will disagree, might argue Source is a better game and they will have their own valid points. In my opinion this game is a true sequel. It brings the fun and nostalgia from the earlier versions of CS, the same flowing game play that made it popular and the heavy emphasis on team game play. It mates the old with the new; the expectations that a FPS be somewhat realistic if not fun to play. It's a modern game; it looks and plays like modern games should but it all looks a bit familiar, like the hot girl from years past that you bump into 10 years later. CS:GO is more technical and team oriented than previous games in the series. Shooting, movement, sound and grenades are completely different and you have to master them once again. Weapons now have a purpose - there's a reason to buy the 5-7 and P250, as well as the MP5 replacement, MP7. Team play is just as important as the economy; once you lose it there's no coming back.It's a demanding skills based that's as satisfying as any CS title has been. Pros: - Updated maps, visuals & sounds - Emphasis on team play - Valve online matchmaking as well as valve casual servers - Extensive customisability & player drops - More realistic player and game behaviour - CS:GO workshop - Pro players - Active development and regular updates - Listens to community - Low-end modern PC requirements for top quality & top resolutionCons: - Gungame isn't the same as CS:S - Because of different skills & tactics, CS:S players will feel like it's a familiar but new game. Skills are transferrable one way, not so much the other; when you play CS:S after CS:GO it will feel and sound like you're playing underwater. - Sound still seems like an afterthought - You will need to upgrade your video card to something made in the last 3 years if you want something that's playable and looks goodRatings:Graphics: 8.5/10, far improved on previous models but there's still room for improvementSound: 8/10, feels like an after-thought, if there's one complaint I have about the game it is that the sound quality and engine just isn't good enoughGameplay: 9.5/10, excellent and extremely playable game with very high replayabilityOverall: 8.5/10, it's a great game and could easily be 9.5 out of 10 with improved audio and slight improvements in visual quality. It's a modern twist on an old classic.Footnote:I lost my way with CS after CS:S and I turned to a variety of other games. Battlefield 1942/2142/2/3, Tom Clancy Rainbow 6, America's Army 2/3/PG. Before then I was an avid player of CS and I would play up to 100 hours per month. When I played CS 10 years ago I always asked, why can't this game be a little more realistic? Why can't they stop people from shooting through 3 walls 20 metres apart and killing with me an awp? Why do grenades act like balloons and float through the air? I can't really emphasise how happy I am that a lot of what shouldn't happen has been removed and the overall quality of visuals, sound and game play has been improved.In the first month of playing I managed to rack up 200 hours of gameplay and I've started contributing back to the community with maps.",hard argu game probabl best cs releas sinc disagre might argu sourc better game valid point opinion game true sequel bring fun nostalgia earlier version cs flow game play made popular heavi emphasi team game play mate old new expect fp somewhat realist fun play modern game look play like modern game look bit familiar like hot girl year past bump year later csgo technic team orient previou game seri shoot movement sound grenad complet differ master weapon purpos there reason buy well replac team play import economi lose there come backit demand skill base that satisfi cs titl pro updat map visual sound emphasi team play valv onlin matchmak well valv casual server extens customis player drop realist player game behaviour csgo workshop pro player activ develop regular updat listen commun lowend modern pc requir top qualiti top resolutioncon gungam isnt css differ skill tactic css player feel like familiar new game skill transferr one way much play css csgo feel sound like your play underwat sound still seem like afterthought need upgrad video card someth made last year want someth that playabl look goodratingsgraph far improv previou model there still room improvementsound feel like afterthought there one complaint game sound qualiti engin isnt good enoughgameplay excel extrem playabl game high replayabilityoveral great game could easili improv audio slight improv visual qualiti modern twist old classicfootnotei lost way cs css turn varieti game battlefield tom clanci rainbow america armi avid player cs would play hour per month play cs year ago alway ask cant game littl realist cant stop peopl shoot wall metr apart kill awp grenad act like balloon float air cant realli emphasis happi lot shouldnt happen remov overal qualiti visual sound game play improvedin first month play manag rack hour gameplay ive start contribut back commun map

To be clear for almost 2 weeks straight at the start they were giving away stuff as an apology for their crap bugs and lag. So if they did have additonal currency they may not have noticed it because of the bulk i'm sorry emails.

"2022 This has to be one of the best culminations of the whole ""Souls Franchise"" FromSoftware has been putting together. It feels like the elements of every game they have made so far have been pieced together to create this game. Along with this, it brings it to the next level being totally open world and filled to the brim with content. Since this is a continuation of the souls series, this game is still quite the challenge and feels similar to Dark Souls III in my opinion.In comparison to the previous souls games, this game is more forgiving with allowing for more variety in combat, however, to counteract this they made bosses more aggressive to take into account the new summoning system. In attempting to reach a wider audience of players, they had to make many of the bosses revolve around fighting multiple foes. This can cause a problem of balancing issues for those who want to run solo without the help if they wanted to.However, this game changes it up with how you approach the bosses. In previous titles, the mechanics of every fight would usually boil down to rolling and hitting, but now there is horse-riding, jumping attacks, a plethora of spells to cast, summoning and much more. I think that there is a huge emphasis on using all of the tools at your disposal because as you progress, the bosses will start to use different attacks that can't be killed in a certain way, causing for necessary readjustments in playstyle.Dungeons, caves, mines, and other kinds of loot are scattered across the world in various amounts allowing for so many different builds for your character. With this game being open-world, exploring feels not just necessary but rewarding for finding ways to progress further. All in all, I think this is a solid game, but I hope they don't follow this same path of having to make use of spawning multiple entities to win boss fights in the most effective way.(Sidenote: Performance issues at launch were terrible and I averaged around 30 FPS in the beginning area. While this issue has been mostly fixed, whenever I enter new areas I get huge dips in FPS until I reboot the game and have the new area loaded in.)",one best culmin whole soul franchis fromsoftwar put togeth feel like element everi game made far piec togeth creat game along bring next level total open world fill brim content sinc continu soul seri game still quit challeng feel similar dark soul iii opinionin comparison previou soul game game forgiv allow varieti combat howev counteract made boss aggress take account new summon system attempt reach wider audienc player make mani boss revolv around fight multipl foe caus problem balanc issu want run solo without help want tohowev game chang approach boss previou titl mechan everi fight would usual boil roll hit horserid jump attack plethora spell cast summon much think huge emphasi use tool dispos progress boss start use differ attack cant kill certain way caus necessari readjust playstyledungeon cave mine kind loot scatter across world variou amount allow mani differ build charact game openworld explor feel necessari reward find way progress think solid game hope dont follow path make use spawn multipl entiti win boss fight effect waysidenot perform issu launch terribl averag around fp begin area issu mostli fix whenev enter new area get huge dip fp reboot game new area load
"I had I lot of hype for Space marine 2, unfortunately the content is lacking, the classes in endgame operations are very imbalanced and DLC content such as armor skins and armor colors were not available as advertised. Main campaign is good however lacks any individuality, it is also very short, taking maybe 6 hrs in total to complete. Operations are the real draw for PVE endgame content, this is where you are introduced to the several classes you are able to play. This game does a horrible job at respecting your time through progression of each class. Classes themselves are very imbalanced with two maybe three being the dominate performers and the rest really feeling lackluster or even unplayable. Animations for parry's and dodges are not consistent, often punishing the player unfairly. Overall, this game feels incomplete, it needs more time in development.

"Campaign: one of the best I've played in recent memory - this is the only part I can recommendPvE: repetitive and loses steam after about 3 runs of each mapPvP: not my jam, no opinion, have not playedOverall the combat and general gameplay is some of the most satisfying I've seen since something like Gears but without all the cover nonsense and the first run of the campaign has some real jaw dropping moments in both visuals and reveals.However, if you're looking for more than the campaign, this is hard to recommend. Much like Left 4 Dead, Back 4 Blood, World War Z, Darktide, etc, there's just nothing to do in the PvE Operations mode except grind out cosmetics and passives. That might be enough for some, but it lacks any of the systems that make something like Destiny, Warframe, Deep Rock Galactic, Remnant, or the plethora of other rougelikes out there that do so much with mapgen and other secondary systems that make each run feel like a run, not just going through the same motions again. I'm never excited by anything that's gonna drop from a mission, it's just ""cross the finish line this many times"" for your next passive/cosmetic. Cosmetics are awesome, classes are fine, progression kinda sucks since you only unlock one row at a time. Not sure I'll be playing long enough to max a single class despite only playing two of them. Passives are... there? They all feel like relatively minor gameplay bonuses that help steer your playstyle, but not one so far has made me excited to unlock or feel it was worth working towards. They feel more like bypasses to some inconvenince rather than some Astartes-level power. I don't think I'd be able to tell an endgame level build from an early game one from gameplay alone.Would be awesome if in new game + you could play the campaign with your custom marine so 60% of the PvE missions were playable with the PvE classes. I think that's my biggest issue, the best PvE content isn't what you get to replay for progression and what's there to replay gets stale fast. Really hope to see some updates to the operations modes that make them more fun to replay. Modifiers, loot drops that persist after a play session, consumable buffs, unique mission rewards, map variants, mapgen, really anything except playing the same mission over and over with some different combat pacing each time.

"2022 The long awaited strategy chaos prequel is finally out, but it has a lot to live up to and I don't think it quite makes the mark.The Good:+Great prologue which introduces both the story and eases new players into the franchise.+Presentation is fantastic, everything from music to monsters. The battles and overworld map are a visual feast.+Combat still feels punchy despite you floating above the fighting.+The new main campaign is slightly more arcady and plays faster, it's even better with the expanded multiplayer.The Bad:-The UI is way too red, add splotches of green and maybe some of that papery texture from the previous games.-Out of the new faction roster, I maybe only liked two (three if you include the DLC). It's hard to say why, but they just feel kind of underwhelming.-Which makes sense, because the unit roster is far smaller than the previous titles.-While the main campaign is faster, it also sucks that you have to wait until after beating it to paint the map.-Oh boy, bugs and crashes!Bottom Line:TW: Warhammer 3 is by no means bad. But, it is lacking the years of polish both of the previous titles have under their belt. If you're new to the franchise, I honestly think you'll have a better time by picking up 1 and 2 on sale, then playing it through the second game. If you've already played the previous titles to death, I can only recommend this if you can stomach less content and more than a few blemishes.

"Space Marine 2 is an instant classic. It harkens back to the days when games were simple but fun. The campaign, while short, is a breath of fresh air when it comes to story-lines. The voice acting is perfect. It has one of the best representations of the WH40K world and most importantly, the Space Marines and the Imperium of Man. The storyline is simple but executed perfectly. The characters are simple as well, stoic, stalwart Marines who will risk death for their fellow brothers and their mission, and that's ok.The devs and Saber should be proud of SM2. It's a return to classic gaming and what makes gaming fun. There's no hidden agendas, narratives or overt political messages shoved down our throats. There's no overly complicated characters with a plethora of problems pouring their hearts out and whining incessantly about how the world is against them. It's a simple storyline about brotherhood, duty, loyalty and just your basic good vs. evil. So refreshing.Buy it. It's worth it. The campaign is gloriously fun and gets your blood pumping with the amazing cinematics. The multiplayer is addictive and isn't overly grindy. You truly feel more powerful as you level up. I look forward to new missions, enemies and PvP modes.",space marin instant classic harken back day game simpl fun campaign short breath fresh air come storylin voic act perfect one best represent world importantli space marin imperium man storylin simpl execut perfectli charact simpl well stoic stalwart marin risk death fellow brother mission that okth dev saber proud return classic game make game fun there hidden agenda narr overt polit messag shove throat there overli complic charact plethora problem pour heart whine incessantli world simpl storylin brotherhood duti loyalti basic good vs evil refreshingbuy worth campaign glorious fun get blood pump amaz cinemat multiplay addict isnt overli grindi truli feel power level look forward new mission enemi pvp mode

"2023 It makes me so sad to review this game with a negative, but in honesty there can't be any other choice with the current state of affairs. I played a lot of Warhammer 2 and it was one of the best games I've ever gotten my hands into, so I had high hopes with WH3. But since the beggining there has been numerous problems: the campaign was terribly planned and executed, sloppy, and it took a long time to get the sandbox experience from Immortal Empires. There was a lot of silence from the devs, and it looked like the game was doomed. Then they released an excellent rework of Warrios of Chaos and a pretty good Chaos Dwarfs DLC, and hope rose again: it looked like CA learned their lesson and started counting with the community to improve the game. And then, the new DLC dropped, at an exhorbitant price not justified for the content it offered, and when the community complained, CA went full passive-aggressive implying if we did'nt buy the product, they would kill the game, and giving explanations about inflation. They are killing the goodwill of the constumers with their actions.I had bought every DLC and game they released for the saga, but in no way I'm going to keep doing that, condoning with my money their terrible choices and threats to the community. The game is also bug riden, and it has been for a long time. They don't have a custodian team to take care of this stuff, and I would also bet that the money from the increase in price of DLCs (150%!) doesn't go either to their employees, but to the CEO and others.In no good faith I can recommend the game in its current state to anyone thinking about buying it. The DLCs are expensive and they will continue to be (as CA said themselves) and the base game experience is ruined by poor choices and bugs that have been there since the beggining. It is just really, really sad.",make sad review game neg honesti cant choic current state affair play lot warhamm one best game ive ever gotten hand high hope sinc beggin numer problem campaign terribl plan execut sloppi took long time get sandbox experi immort empir lot silenc dev look like game doom releas excel rework warrio chao pretti good chao dwarf dlc hope rose look like ca learn lesson start count commun improv game new dlc drop exhorbit price justifi content offer commun complain ca went full passiveaggress impli didnt buy product would kill game give explan inflat kill goodwil constum actionsi bought everi dlc game releas saga way im go keep condon money terribl choic threat commun game also bug riden long time dont custodian team take care stuff would also bet money increas price dlc doesnt go either employe ceo othersin good faith recommend game current state anyon think buy dlc expens continu ca said base game experi ruin poor choic bug sinc beggin realli realli sad

"2022 While Immortal Empires certainly was a breath of fresh air for the game, there are still so many bugs and simply downgrades from game 2 that I would not recommend this game if you don't know what you are getting into. I still play it and enjoy it, but that's only because I can overlook the major issues that plague the game (and especially how incredibly slow CA has been at addressing any of them). Just go play Total War Warhammer 2 instead, which is in a great state right now.A few specific (major and minor) negatives for Immortal Empires (The twwh3 campaign alone is awful so let's just pass over that)------------------------------------------------------------>the ui is just straight up worse than game 2. I don't even know what happened here except that they wanted to change it for the sake of changing it. The faction selection is terrible, mission panel is worse to use, etc.sound design is good for the most part, but once again projectile units sound like *** with very few exceptions. Almost like someone else did them specifically (both blackpowder and bows/crossbows)>many factions have been nerfed and a lot of their interesting mechanics removed. While I do understand the need to reduce power in some cases, the big problem here is the lack of anything interesting in its stead. Just ends up making them less exciting to play.>Bugs, bugs, oh so many bugs. Yes that's to be expected, but they could at least have done some hotfixes by now. Some of them make certain factions nigh-unplayable or remove key parts of their identity (lack of items, heroes, quests, etc.).>Hero traits ... what the hell happened here. The vast majority of them are just straight up awful, while some are very good. I don't expect all of them to be great, but at least something decent. Rn the difference in power is astonishing Ogres are especially notorious here, with some default traits providing bigger benefits than their unique faction traits in the same attribute. Cathay similarly has some very weird traits ... all the good ones are of one type (Yin), while the Yang traits are just plain useless. That's not even to speak of factions that pretty much only have useless traits.>Personal issue, but the game is generally too easy right now. The AI is way too passive even at legendary leading to extremely fast campaign burnout (by turn 50 the campaign is basically over, cause nothing can challenge you anymore).>Lack of field battles. This is especially notorious on higher difficulties due to the ai sitting in their settlements as soon as they even get a whiff of your army. Additionally, since the autoresolve is as forgiving as it is right now, you barely ever fight any field battles past turn 20. It's always siege or minor settlement battles, which are both incredibly easy to defeat (easier than field battles in most cases). This has a lot of knock-on effects, such as gunpower units being generally awful in actual battle (due to the ai behaving smarter by avoiding LoS and targeting them with archers) or ranged units in general being subpar (again due to ai perfectly microing to avoid being shot as much as possible). This leads to sieges being either a melee slog or being cheesed in the vast majority of cases.>continuing with the gunpowder issue, the obstacle detection right now is so jank, that often those type of units don't even shoot if there is virtually nothing in front of them. It was already bad in game 2, but so much worse now. You often can't even shoot larger targets stuck in your infantry, because they seemingly don't realize that 60% of those trolls are sticking out above the heads of their comrades. Add to that the fact that most ai actively targets gunpowder units (such as handgunners, ironhails, thunderers, etc.) and you'll likely get a better performance out of any bow/crossbow unit. Those can shoot above your own units, have less targetting issues and most importantly don't require 10 seconds of micro each to get into a position where they can actually shoot properly.There are many other points that irk me, but I think these are some that might give you an idea of whether or not you may enjoy the game in its current state. I do believe it will get better with time, but as it is now I can't see this being anytime soon.",immort empir certainli breath fresh air game still mani bug simpli downgrad game would recommend game dont know get still play enjoy that overlook major issu plagu game especi incred slow ca address go play total war warhamm instead great state right nowa specif major minor neg immort empir campaign alon aw let pass thatth ui straight wors game dont even know happen except want chang sake chang faction select terribl mission panel wors use etcsound design good part projectil unit sound like except almost like someon els specif blackpowd bowscrossbowsmani faction nerf lot interest mechan remov understand need reduc power case big problem lack anyth interest stead end make less excit playbug bug oh mani bug ye that expect could least done hotfix make certain faction nighunplay remov key part ident lack item hero quest etchero trait hell happen vast major straight aw good dont expect great least someth decent rn differ power astonish ogr especi notori default trait provid bigger benefit uniqu faction trait attribut cathay similarli weird trait good one one type yin yang trait plain useless that even speak faction pretti much useless traitsperson issu game gener easi right ai way passiv even legendari lead extrem fast campaign burnout turn campaign basic caus noth challeng anymorelack field battl especi notori higher difficulti due ai sit settlement soon even get whiff armi addit sinc autoresolv forgiv right bare ever fight field battl past turn alway sieg minor settlement battl incred easi defeat easier field battl case lot knockon effect gunpow unit gener aw actual battl due ai behav smarter avoid lo target archer rang unit gener subpar due ai perfectli micro avoid shot much possibl lead sieg either mele slog chees vast major casescontinu gunpowd issu obstacl detect right jank often type unit dont even shoot virtual noth front alreadi bad game much wors often cant even shoot larger target stuck infantri seemingli dont realiz troll stick head comrad add fact ai activ target gunpowd unit handgunn ironhail thunder etc youll like get better perform bowcrossbow unit shoot unit less target issu importantli dont requir second micro get posit actual shoot properlyther mani point irk think might give idea whether may enjoy game current state believ get better time cant see anytim soon
