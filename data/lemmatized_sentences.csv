elden ring first game ever gotten achievement amazing
best game ever played loved every minute playing
story world character loved
felt like kid candyshop except storeowner everyone shop trying kill keep dodging trying steal candy giggling wildly gone mad touched giant burned smoldering hand three finger hey least get awesome looking eye
yeah ca wait dlc come
game get golden
blood gut friend guy ask really
one best game ever played emperor hochland trait
knowledgeable trait
mechanic used good completely worthless
know single player game mildly overpowered mechanic take lot work take advantage allowed also understand multiplayer community gamemode feel balanced
stop bringing overly balanced approached single player
care conquest mode multiplayer stuff keep getting added
understand obsession trying shoehorn coop game even done well
one step forward two step start addressing elephant room
hour game recommend
well let breakdown hour hour duplicating progress world section already hour riding around open world fighting enemy exploring dungeon fighting boss hour actual fun part game legacy dungeon
area follow format previous soul game feature area interesting enemy hour arena pvp invasion overall make hour fun content hour filler
planning buy game play friend prepared ratio fun filler content
like get criticism game world open world honestly really beautiful engaging first area limgrave liurnia caelid
able explore intended horse playing multiplayer big deal
first area good amount content packed seeing enemy variety first time bored yet
problem begin way game altus plateau
area really beautiful well probably favorite visually start notice really empty area lot enemy open world
get leyndell arrive worst part game mountaintops giant
area think one single new enemy previous area different skin
even worth word describe bad area
buy game despite negative review advice hop horse ride straight bos nothing worth exploring
right another empty snow area devs use innovative trick area covered snowstorm
expertly hide area time finish see devoid content first netcode game multiplayer absolute trash
connecting friend fails hang time invading requires use item time successfully invade someone
far anyone tell fromsoft basically still using netcode used back dark soul couple bandaids thrown top prevent infinite backstabs
latency huge decider every fight lot skill come able quickly identify approximate ping difference opponent adapting tactic skill pve carry
pve look enemy attack decide press dodge think hit pvp press dodge anyways matter weapon invisible hitboxes latency
top fromsoft decided make latency issue even prominent introducing powerful status effect build even successfully dodge enemy attack
top level pvp full scarlet rot sleep status abuser exploit fact status effect build even dodge counter duplicate item cheating cure middle combat
oh want turn tactic around need duplicate item sleep rot grease limited quantity obtain legitimately single playthrough
watching invasion honestly make laugh many item player popping like candy
pvp laughably top multiplayer decision made developer described anything stupid
first requires item even allowed summon people
early game waste time farming flower probably minute trying figure summon look
next kill bos summon friend anymore invaded area
kill boss particular chunk whole area multiplayer
kill bos anywhere world even random dragon sent home cooperator
random preventing entering cave friend disconnect ride spot world enter cave world friend logical right
obviously improves gameplay even everything working properly networking issue getting way elden ring horribly balanced
first couple boss every challenge game start become easy
enemy simply coded well deal multiple player attacking
boss change target anytime take damage even tiny throwing knife meaning incredibly easy
boss supposed able kill damaging punishing try heal always able heal unless mess horribly get killed single combo
happen boss still take try difference multiplayer singleplayer
despite fact game increase enemy health game least time easier
try compensate friend turned taunter tongue attract invader game still easy incredibly hard invader fairly beat people
try invading probably walk blender people spamming spell ash war die second
mean people left invading higher level people manage fun within framework player willing use tactic necessary win
prepared deal lot duplicated rot grease duplicated starlight shard snipe across map duplicated golem arrow nuke build kill make single mistake
even blame player using tactic without would invader higher level
game simply broken player forced resort tactic chance winning story mostly incomprehensible rely solely playing game
watch youtube video idea going
watching though came conclusion every one main player greedy
george martin tried craft complicated story gameplay support
imagine game throne background civilian story
lord lady fighting empty castle full monster
elden ring
every single creature attack sight visible civilian
fighting become lord game alright simply good way spend time
come back ratio fun filler
maybe others find acceptable ratio
wish could get back hour spent game implore others make mistake
mimic far get free hug anytime feel heartbroken course going recommend even tho met couple unfair boss stutter dear old camera one hit away killing first bos reason camera decided give beautiful view wall behind
know sometimes feel myazaki u intentionally game bunch still play high image quality today update even keep ca even play game
feel safe game installed feel like computer security stake
game objectively decent safety stake admin right every time launch game ever need program startup apps real red flag privacy eula yes read hope steam something game make sure report game middle steam page potential malware
love game getting closer closer still retaining like source
good game lot cheater
recommend
never sleep
addition immortal empire many bugfixes game worth buying
although immortal empire still beta want wait fully released wait couple month
stuttering hell still support ultrawide even
fix ultrawide easily use mod get banned eac
great
game peak return monke fun bun despite typical bug warhammer game released another solid fun game even playing different campaign
friend also blast different mode per usual
yo father probably one oldest people playing game
single farther son
son got game christmas uncle installed computer started playing
end week hour game
horrible already hard find way spend time son always friend watching youtube
decided make steam account get game see could maybe play alongside
loaded game picked character world started playing stuck supposed
asked son help hosted game join
loved best time spent son since wife died
game ever since brought son closer actually spend time together outside house together well
game reminded fun everything brought son many happy memory
burn heretic kill mutant purge unclean angel aside game everything warhammer space marine community wanted expected
continuation previous title also serf warning gaming industry people want simpler shorter game lot quality refinement present intense combat combination gunfight combat keep action immersive environment design graphical improvement attention detail ensure impressive visual storyline exploration dystopian universe warhammer becomes immersive mature narrative focused epic horde presence tyranids brings additional element challenge forcing player always move plan attack
traitorous heretic also difficult opponent deal especially higher difficulty making rethink direction many forget mention art direction game incredible large battlefield scenario gigantic cathedral detail wall building
everything game seems painting sometimes combat game let realize get moment peace look around almost impossible point consider possible repetitiveness depending game progression combat large horde become campaign average length depending difficulty playing maintains good narrative
believe warhammer space marine currently warning beacon industry necessary make major innovation make good game giving example little refinement something already good enough make good game
anyway game hope helped way decide whether play game c go
counter serisinin altını
tamamen öbür oyunlarının birbirine benzerliğinden uzaklaşmış üstüne tuğla konulmuş hali
ca play friend server overloaded battle pas move server great game series recommending till vile greedy dlc policy chanegs best game least xd free weekend player
first wh game ever played though enjoyed prologue campaign understand pay lot money gain access faction
euro game alone plus dlcs ridicilous
personally ca recommend game current state right review come fair time launch patch fix certain game
pre ordered game played release amount hour game time writing speaks much fun title
know changed main campaign utterly atrocious invasive mechanic mind numbing realm chaos mechanic tzeentch random teleports know thought fun good idea dev side really neutered enjoymnet game first play game legitimately enjoyable wo pretend played every faction explored every nook cranny tree personal taste play fun bit wore quickly
think superb job numerous quality life change overall game feel like lesser package
could indeed make argument year dlc accompany agree compare quality difference compared game staggering
waited make review give time iron balancing mostly wait immortal empire big pull game today learned beta coming another month least mind boggling
recall within month two one hand trying make sure everything work smoothly releasing many issue game blatant know found time content creator got hand realistic expect ingrained issue fixed
lord defeat trait joke skill tree lackluster joke comparison others tech tree also seesaw fun boring almost noticeable change hero trait also neutered think ok game disappointed feel bad getting friend excited play u get bored campaign within week
blunder ever seen one ca
many change recently hat know say speechless
one thing change communication player sometimes insane get deal someone knowledge ca help
would dream would help lot case problem people
probably best game
game combination feature game
gameplay division weird af story line like secret world palworld capturing creature work produce game survival light survival mechanic fun contribute jive like rust traditional crafting game
fun thats feel game fall short dedicated server really see stuck friend one server full fu wont able join forced play another server unless move start scratch
release damn dedicated server everyone play still think great game thumb
gotdgame journalism need die best game made china total war player fan historical fantasy title
break heart criticize recommend game time
great potential feature faction great
however poorly poorly optimized
ultra graphic texture detail game still look worse beautiful unit find warhammer
requirement higher warhammer base game requires incredible gb twice warhammer needed dlcs
warhammer require gb dlcs released file forcing player store file chosen purchase yet
either unacceptable
require higher tier gpus double storage space dollar get product currently less content worse performance game released year ago
main issue bug sort abound player multiplayer lobby appear properly instead showing mp lobby showing cycling one pair
chat unfathomable reason game published without
word want play team mp people friend expect zero communication mention people struggle even see lobby let alone join really hope issue fixed
obvious willingness publish game stage demonstrates profound disrespect player fan total war brand
look total war three kingdom see cause concern
game charged everyone dollar completely unplayable multiplayer never bothered fix instead discontinuing support within couple year
issue obvious surely reparable
yet nothing
stand right endorse game recommend anyone spend money reason many review pointed release game come significantly worse performance expecting
current capable running previous game ultra setting easily maintain condition average gpu temp game however running setting struggling maintain even fps average gpu temp spike fact begun smell molten plastic
able reach toned setting absolute lowest went however still resulted average temp approaching weird thing performance seems vary wildly user people worse system use better performance people better system worse performance vice versa clear pattern
granted may well smooth ride though likely worth gamble considering report user game outright fried addition would appear early access folk reporting game ran better even day release
patch hit game released worse performance
comparing benchmark found would reduced performance
could poor implementation denuvo inclusion could patch accidentally messed factor known point
regardless game function ought fixed recommend anyone reading spare pc unoptimised mess wait
hand one best game ever played
kind new soulsborne type game gaming friend used die hard dark soul player however reason never got
elden ring sucked managed spend ton fun hour
time like greedy publisher like ea lootboxes pleasing shareholder fromsoftware boy come gem show u feel like play proper game thanks guy
actually gon na start playing dark soul game highly replayable beautiful world gated content
playing right instead reading review
performance issue sound like convinient way avoid saying skill issue dark soul open world video game best game ever iii face reality terminal illness diagnosis game become rare light life
growing found comfort unforgiving challenge beauty soulslike game may final month game given chance reconnect comfort one last developer created visually stunning mechanically precise action rpg offer challenge sense achievement crave
intricate combat alongside visually striking environment make every moment memorable
given something look forward allowing lose rich world need fan soulslike game appreciate art well crafted challenge ca recommend black myth wukong enough
game gift providing final sense purpose achievement
deepest gratitude go developer creating masterclass
human wholf human game dedicated around hour playing every single day experiencing range emotion fun laughter excitement
opinion game definitely contender game year though need fix
game offer survival experience filled monster elite boss dungeon silo easter egg puzzle many feature
bizarre creature compelling storyline could use update stunning graphic smooth gameplay robust system though could use feature clipping fix
unfortunately human feel empty inactive
despite hundred base use
maximum player per world rarely encounter player except world event
issue need addressing soon finding active warband hive currently challenging
example looking active warband server one seems engage world chat participate warband activity disappointing
luckily fix coming august let hope best
issue applies playing friend
friend ca join server full even though feel empty
problem also expected resolved august
however another issue arises new player joining level player
could share item boost ideal
ca wait play whole group want start
player complain two file claim game
first two file harmless information available online
second game buy cosmetic battle pas
reach level obtain best gear weapon complete village city area side quest main quest build powerful character game feel complete
personally finished everything significant maybe missing puzzle
making youtube tutorial exploring finding easter egg reworking base
high hope content future ca wait see next
game offer lot vast world plenty activity challenge world event area clear puzzle easter egg compelling storyline unique item extensive weapon gear customization
music sound effect also exceptionally well done especially main menu music reminds good old call duty day
however game might easy
level player fight level enemy right loadouts
leveling also straightforward focus exploring quest rather dungeon
depends playstyle really
development team active communicative providing information answering question handling ticket
passionate happy work
unlike many company big game team handle thing well wish best
additionally pvp server pvp zone sometimes object building render properly long distance
create illusion hit enemy actually hidden behind rock inside house
encountered multiple time quite frustrating
hopefully issue fixed soon
another point consider pvp getting wrecked opponent might using powerful build like shrapnel build deal lot damage
keep mind summarize top positive negative
vast array feature human
crafting
detailed loadout system blueprint
large world plenty explore discover
game impressive graphic immersive
server system friend ca join server feel
game bit
overpowered build done
clunky building system alignment clipping
occasional crash even perfectly capable human highly enjoyable game
packed feature boast great graphic easy progress
despite minor bug system need update human feel like blend palworld fallout rust
giving far
great job ca wait see youtube human playlist video human redeemable code view list redeemable code human currently
additional code listed
contact steam click twitch click youtube click steam follow click discord click contact wholf discord adding steam
adding steam make sure leave comment profile
due safety many request
greedy stupid stupid greedy
total war fan since shogun total war one passed breaking point ca segas
every new game manage grade core thing remove feature
even tw troy unit flail eachother
early mid total war game function better offer immersive experience game coming year later
audacity dlc price model equivalent someone spit face
first chaos lord pack joke blatantly transparent removed core game resold
chaos dwarf half price game feel like poorly thought play tested pile half cooked idea
lay give watered economy make province identical sustain let alone giving resource second third army
literally cant bring recommend total war game friend embarrassing greedy ca gotten
cherry top basically saying buy kill game
guy deserve every ounce hate getting
review bomb entire community hitting breaking point
eat bag sega ca day total war played franchise year price hike bug feel like ca taking piss
fix give u break price hopefully get back complaining difficulty year old grandma could play dark graphic m graphic matter music story game like playing temple runner people want well epic imagine kingdom heart price perfect could complete waste requirement run high nasa length short hour hour average hour long hour extremely long hour fun rather watch paint hard actually pretty kind fun ride wait infinitely worth buying wait yes ultimate al taif experience daddy titus good faith recommend game current state developer recent statement threatening outright cutting support game buy overpriced dlc almost half price base game
ridiculous
hour three game combined stand
company let bug fester month end hinder prevent user using paid content paid game nakai recruiting kroxigors ariel spawning example despite community fixing day slowest patch cycle game dev era threatening customer standing unreasonable price increase
less content buying year ago tomb king vampire coast even lord pack game
company beyond greedy respect player stood decade
buy game unless ok rely modders create better experience devs ever achieved pay overpriced dlc cost nearly half much triple game market
seems like amalgamation content recently successful game
death stranding rust fortnite even
nothing inherently wrong done worst way love game randomly spend almost minute dumping copious amount dialogue verbiage try make sense happening
become elden ring game amazing
got ta best journey west themed game time man fair
play like hardcore action game skill tree difficult boss
hard soul game also difficult enough keep engaged
aesthetically gorgeous transport another world
buddhist horror great aesthetic
ok amazing game every aspect
delivers breathtaking combat stunning production quality unforgettable bos fight
fun play linear world region lot exploration secret enemy
story inspired classic journey west novel
totally recommended something god war sekiro shadow die twice
beta immortal empire available player lot bug fixed safe say shaping one greatest game ever played
launch rocky immortal empire much better getting better patch
good game good warhammer

right discus entitlement earn playing game ca valve care cheater
go hour without getting banned maybe even longer even vod clearly show
get worse worse closer global get supreme
every game happen day
maybe every two day
incredibly frustrating
believe outplaying every turn watch vod see even couldnt
occurs even high rank prime matchmaking
even start see repeat account get banned name pic month
account rack hour cheating getting high rank
valve make money cheater people buy key super lax
see anywhere near level cheating fortnite vastly less competitive game definitely possible stop cheat
peak game honestly really run warhammer perfectly fine large unit scale medium setting fact ca even run lowest setting medium unit scale get fps ridiculous
game series surely keep minimum bar improve upper end
would say something good bad new mechanic could experience
buy game state
could run average pc probably notice serious performance drop
great pc disregard sure power lack optimisation
good game plagued periodic retarded decision ca
sh actually hilarious
playing c time play even like fun swear god
like f cking intense heated time p ssed
like f cking mad
like bro wan na play like literally afterwards like bro love dude
weird
game hate playing miss miss playing
much fun
honest god f ckin around guy
jasonr soo kind like heroin
purchased game still buggy still run like minor settlement battle still terrible game design unchanged empire mod fixed problem ca still ashamed releasing early
player tag early access game would recommend game full price even huge fan month development show improvement
idk performance visuals compared warhammer seriously lacking
visual glitch campaign map specifically crazy
texture voble army
using overall fog hide helping seems devs tried
really like game mechanic gameplay wise performance big downside
another note fond supply line especially need smaller army spread land battle incurions randomly spawned demon gate
prologue super cool tho love improvement like playing turn building outpost recruiting friend troop battling etc
overall would say game good need polishing
sure wish would gone another design miao yings hair dragon form update improved lot still glitch wo deny
however apart exclusive campaign warhammer mortal empire campaign masterpiece
ithas ton great feature content
ranged unit longer work fixed since launch even worse siege
ai broken af seem affected wounded battle since respawn troop general turn lost
sad beloved game csgo died
game bad anti cheat terrible people getting false ban high driver real cheater getting banned vac valve allow cheat new content month even old content removed upon new operation crazy since leak seasonal new case even though many leak new skin new submission achievement gone csgo left one useless achievement danger zone got released csgo whent free play gone original deathmatch mode team v team sub tick embarrassing bad asking got ca switch hand command changing weapon bobbing arm race best gamemode opinion flying scoutsman really fun gamemode released game really fun u casual watching demo really overwatch system leaf u bad reporting system everybody get x amount griefing report get performance issue even pro bought pc best component issue performance imagine would someone peekers advantage crazy gamethe thing crazy valve made almost billion dollar case last year money going
valve use money right thing beg
make best game deserve abuse fact loyal playerbase
game much replayability spent hundred hour even starting get bored want give rating ca hater also suck game
fight made eat hitboxes locked attack simply connecting reason
oh instant transmission attack enemy
game look feel great minus rep point button scheme controller
polishing patch change review solid
ppl absolute action rpg perfect warhammer fan good introduction newcomer
almost parry anything fan bad performance
ca terrible launch reviewcurrently game good state regular update address problem
latest dlc great like old day
monke gameplay good many bug
model enemy rendering able dmg checkpoint loading even team around
restart checkpoint
got hit map oblivion didnt die
restart
far good best soul like game ever
maybe probably yes whole wholeheartedly say amazing game
probably problem especially online connectivity enjoyed every minute playing open world give plenty space explore find interesting thing story fleshed latest software game except sekiro one story told conventional way combat make
many character game much dialogue
lot easier make story elden ring dark soul bloodborn demon soul
oh god worldbuilding gameplay well known gameplay time player many tool use overcome hardship world land
better spell longer range ash war put almost weapon summoning ash help bos fight exploring world
think even experience lot easier past game
basically infinite resource call player help longer invaded play alone
invasion also great reward think people wo even invade
yes people hate invasion mandatory respect opinion agree game offer vast array boss weapon customized different ash war
make game feel diverse
played different character start two completed game close playthrough still finished say felt different every ring one game never delete hard drive always come back play
slowly getting better right discus entitlement earn playing game amazing culmination total war warhammer saga finally featuring immortal empire campaign
next
definition great game real bad as game
run great combat amazing ton customization
steam artwork screenshot steam artwork acubens steam artwork screenshot steam artwork acubens steam artwork screenshot steam artwork acubens recommended first game
ig big sword made sword cut thing real good
official creator game ca quite grasp went wrong release
known play mmo release day patch day felt like many thing changed better
within hour already encountered many thing back game
much love concept let break thing made slightly sour either spontaneous lost eyesight graphic downgrade
highest setting everything look like well blurry mobile game
case beta ca choose haircolor properly anymore feel later pay different variant design mitsuko look fckable also well
need catch horny bois
personal preference tho ignore point eula also made mistake reading past eula cause would think steam game collecting data credit card info bank info profile password exact address information consume click web social medium
animation apparently work intended got changed partially way less animated option like basically everything pickaxe enemy one character per server account deletable known bug want change still horrible launch wrong partially still existing translation object fixed hoped many enemy looking like plastic figure cause graphic v included endlessly loading chat sending fell map couple enemy bugged groundall said past say
game put time development advertisement
also find reviewspamming see people coming know release hurt game enough playercount wo change recommendation soon thing change better
creator sugarcoating thing evened long ago beta recommendation wait bit couple patch
""
play without reading eula dude
cheer
revisiting review later hour great time
one game recommend full beaten game played hour
time comprehensive game fantastic entry point soul people bounced series still managing top tier entry genre already board
open world expertly done taking many lesson breath wild improving upon better reward structure exploration tense encounter many different type adversary wide possibility build character progress game sense discovery found game near unmatched
every major area feel unique visual aesthetic gameplay requirement
quite lot time love went making joy player stumble area much grander initially perceived moment seem keep coming
like soul game elder ring share secret area boss many people never see even hitting credit
encourage explore actively would also advise look secret complete game let first adventure world truly
trust plenty resource without resort walkthrough
high expectation game still impressed
favor play
monkey someone shot approximately arrow monkeying canyon
woke headless man slapping banger guitar
got kicked large angry frog
solved tense dispute
solved bug infestation
found tony tiger drinking remained man brutal murder
discovered shortly tony tiger knew
game everything want stuff know wanted
love monke
beautiful gameplay absolute must play masterpiece
world enemy design mysterious bit history piece together journey game everything dripping consideration meticulous world building
top three game time
game fundamentally changed open world game forever
allow get lost world lore gameplay disappointed
favour buy discounted
worth every penny several time
bravo fromsoft
game concentrated power painand reason purchase game game pretty decent core performance issue aside campaign game come boring repetetive couldnt finish one single campaign simply got bored arround turn
wait mod support fix campaign big big map
ca tell exactly somehow feel even skripted single player diplomacy worthless
faction basically never confederate certain point faction x declare war game feel getting strong regardless actually treated
dumbed game even total war everyone declare war regardless make sense
get rid diplomacy dont pretend thing isnt
ai well battle boring artillery doesnt work spell dont work ranged combat super weak cavellery
spam tough melee unit ftw
product received free early negative review seems like gear war shred humanity looked really good
middling lot way one way exceptional like zoolander really really really ridiculously good looking
graphically demanding run fairly well upscaling menu bear dire implication future graphic ai upscaling presented balanced option native resolution presented quality option
overheats pc fairly basic gameplay
gun good slightly underwhelming melee lightweight system dash arkham particularly deep
could get better hurry find
feel like gear war armor system replacing cover system
love tone dire slow run lot character flat one dimensional
much popcorn appeal also hard take gravitas since game big silly action figure ripping apart lizard
also lack mortality urgency gear character since space marine basically invincible superheroes universe walking past expendable nameless ig willing sacrifice without second hesitation
grim serious verging joyless invincibility fantasy odd wavelength try play along basic tps
verdict wish playing vanquish instead
fun exciting overwhelming
basically open world soul
awesome
best game world
saved lot money staying home play warhammer total war
absolutely unacceptable third final game released state
one boring experience tw game look like getting month ie come ea name
aswell take long blood joke unfinished game
leave cat everybody pass pet give thumb award フ l ヽ ﾉ space marine
shame ca game nothing short breathtaking experience
moment step richly detailed world feel care craftsmanship went every aspect game
visuals stunning environment beautiful also incredibly immersive
location meticulously designed drawing inspiration chinese mythology way feel authentic combat system standout feature offering perfect blend challenge satisfaction
every encounter feel meaningful requiring skill strategy rather
variety enemy keep gameplay fresh bos battle nothing short epic one unique test truly elevates black myth wukong storytelling
narrative deep engaging weaving together familiar tale journey west fresh twist keep hooked start finish
protagonist sun wukong brought life complexity depth make journey blast far highly recommended
رهيبه ابداااااااااع فننننننننننننننننننننن سب سكرايب ولايك قايز wholesome lighthearted open world epic chinese story finally told
good stuff dark soul iiii jump button open world elden ring evolution established design trend software studio
er follows gameplay formula dark soul new added mechanic fundamentally change gameplay
game derivative predecessor new element rather changing formula feel like continuation
open world new element open world aspect game best realised
instead following usual practise separating activity game progression
er link game progression exploration make focus
design core follows principle thoughtful minimalism focus
combined together create game world player navigate without utilising map
instead player visually lead drawn nearest objective interesting place
impressive almost major location visible distance help point player right direction
sheer scale verticality location spectacular
instead using elaborate illusion make huge location like previous game
er aim make location fully explorable massive time
addition jumping button also allowed interesting intricate level design
royal capital leyndell pinnacle design biggest location game
imagine anor londo yarhnam explore everything see
open world er also introduces element nonlinearity formula bloodborne became increasingly linear
nonlinearity allows greater build variety gameplay freedom player beat almost bos want order want pursue different reward result
however approach corner cut result game reuses many asset neatly balanced previous fit suprisingly well gameplay loop
reward exploration incentive seeking new cookbook importantly give immadiate access neccesary consumables without need farm enemy crafting resource plenty abundant game world
furthermore system entirely optional crafting tied character progression crafting selection limited consumables projectile like arrow knife
mention many said item also sold merchant found corps
combat er build upon expands d combat template
major enemy boss follow design principle enemy thier delayed attack agressive combo
er go even making boss even agressive delayed attack smaller opening window even adjust thier attack string behaviour player input position
put even emphasis evasion swift attack
turn make bos fight even dynamic engaging forcing player take risk carfully find opportunity strike instead waiting bos finish attack
furthermore boss specifically designed punish old habit veteran soul player force adapt change thier strategy overcame challenge
feel like addition summon ash negative impact game balance
enhanced enemy agression input reading explained way combat trivializing aspect system
result feel battle design balanced summon ash especially crucible knight duo
edit fixed issue patch decreasing boss aggression group obnoxious case input reading removed since
summon ash still easy mode game corner use much war system great
allows player change weapon art armament thier scalling site grace
highly encourages experimentation weapon switching
amazing addition creates even build variety
horse combat entirely uninteresting becomes dull quickly
fortunately game rarely ever force player fight horse majority boss fought foot
think torrent added mean transport combat afterthought
conclusion overall dark soul iv elden ring natural conclusion previous game
fundamentally bigger better bloodborne darksouls
however adherence already established formula hinders restrains studio creative potential
think follow forumla endlessly
er great game wish would experiment thier game starting eat thier importantly want sellen sit face playing kislev basically slavic history
overpowered enemy attack time western neighbor harm good many maiden reach made erd tree
maidenless life
hate xenos dark soul made new game actually engine change game less feature map
removed ability play previous version knew nobody would move one level support content ever
merged review completely different game one
great game
simply list list lol pro con pro streamlined action slash experience even bad kind game forget breath
game like buttonmash visuals stunning style
area might feel dark tweak brightness needed
music voice acting play chinese voice btw ear candy
story exactly expect
myth legend
fairytale want
modern b
also monke
con performance weird
one time open game work framedrops silky smooth framerate another time may encounter weird bug fps cap
know cause solves restart
invisible wall preordered game ca level flask get one greatest gaming experience recently worth money pay
especially regional waiting fix technical issue good problem wrong construction hour learned even though game performance issue still exceptional game
game learned previous title well new exciting thing
game full hacker matter think elden game sold million copy year
era game live service demonstrated incredibly difficult experience blockbuster
fromsoft biggest hit cemented one iconic developer time
world spoken game great
fact like much totally irrelevant
value honesty review case honest mean going grain
kind daunting reviewer among brave enough critique mona lisa taylor swift latest album
sort juggernaut hard approach summoned courage ready first complaint switch open world
dark soul game series branching corridor path opening closing dynamically
real sense momentum pushing forward bonfire bonfire delving ever deeper personal quest
set mood claustrophobic ring contrast feel large
simply following critical path get maimed encouraged spend lot time around landscape
beautiful landscape sure altogether little happening
liurnia particular dull slog area suffer design emphasizes scenery sense sense flow boss also feel like downgrade previous title
core combat game learning attack pattern opponent
starting sekiro design became bit meta predict boss designer predict u right back
thing like use example game stomp attack little leg hitch draw animation unexpectedly sword swing actually bluff downward little bait animation ruin fun
dark soul felt good demon lifted club strike guessed timing demon missed
elden ring contrast make timing janky catch
move combat away visual prediction towards rote memorization lessens
could easily forgiven story gripping optimistic front considering george martin involvement
sadly story garbage told poorly know true watched youtube video order understand rather go torture trying learn lore gameplay
understanding story hour disjointed investigative work struggling side quest become uncompletable slight breeze reading item description insufferably vague context clue
vaatividya ilk completely lost simply poor felt like vague allusion sake vague allusion
much left open interpretation line loose end plot hole feel blurred fundamentally weakens narrative
nobody motif explicable thus nobody motif interesting
elden ring honestly feel like dark soul
one could argue bloodborne sekiro felt like interesting compelling innovation core mechanic established demon soul
elden ring innovate
slapped coat paint went open world called day
soul became grace lord cinder became rune bearer mechanic almost entirely rehashed old title
boring ultimately none complaint important
million copy remember
review going get drowned positive review people great hour game honestly probably best
clearly something really special lot people love celebrated
fromsoft fan rpg fan fan challenging combat game general left disappointed elden ring
good fps many cheater smurfer
stunning graphic enthralling enemy fascinating character fun gameplay great good game
good game
cant play game ohh let start rank ban powerless thousand dumbiest thing ever seen teammate would say im skill silver etc hour playing different acc seen lot thing
game year
game delivers experience exceptional feel like slap face certain western developer reviewer criticized simply good weaving rich narrative pull deep mystical world chinese mythology
rare find game captivates plot also keep engaged brilliant engine game push boundary possible gaming graphic today
visual fidelity every detail smallest blade grass epic bos fight rendered stunning clarity
environment immersive almost feel atmosphere texture around game also excels combat mechanic though bos fight truly test skill
may find battle challenging perfect blend strategy action rewarding player master game world many game starting feel formulaic black myth wukong stand bold innovative title
fully utilizes power unreal engine deliver best graphic year also experience feel new exciting
game testament talent vision developer anyone looking truly unforgettable gaming check yt gameplay defeated every single bos game jpxdee one beautifull game ever played great game spend evening hour nice positive supportive teammate
like zen garden calm soul free mind
recommend everyone try make better person fun
good nice quest product received free emperor still fun playing game year fun game played many year
unacceptable performance stuttering ahoy frame drop often nothing going
hopefully patched recommend nine month later work patch thing still find performance disappointing frequent drop fps
review remains especially look like abandoning releasing patch made game look worse
cant recommend game current state
go play tw tw tw bug already fixed previous there huge problem pathing collision unit mass knockback damage making unit useless
top main campaign thats fun time repalyability frustrating limiting creativity forced snowball time specific way lose game especialy v hard legendary

masterpiece rare today gaming landscape reminiscent time called golden age gaming absolute warhammer brutality incredible model detail high fidelity dense loincloth physic world look amazingly beautiful sheer scale awe every simple satisfying much polished space marine movement feel super satisfying heavy astarte gunplay impactful smooth though aiming feel bit clunky time due way melee transcendent experience emperor intended right splash old school gaming feel play like true space marine titus chairon chadriel amazing moment campaign save recidious system annihilation xenos choas scum background character like major sarkaana cpt
sevastus acheran others aboard battle barge memorable right though many ultramarine primaris power armour dialogue face behind suit intrigued enough warrant campaign element story campaign created immersive experience thanks designing object game everything feel authentic millennium time epic grand dazzling word small describe awe felt finishing campaign religious experience say short would loved longer campaign easily day
hopefully future expansion could added bring fourth story
overall successor space marine worth waiting year fact time game would possible see play blessing great privilege
anyone fan universe say must buy complaint leave wanting
разъебные в слезы анимации между главами сюжетка просто ахуй я фанат всяких мифолоджи ляма онлайн на старте это вообще какне прогнувшая студия aliexpress coin monkey monkey monkey monke brother
previous state toxic practice mixed reused asset sold new mechanic new race core game suffers made new addition title worth buying untill main game fixed
developpers focus dead campaign mode instead putting love main played one immortal empire
even mentioning ca openly threatening playerbase response bad latest original review recommended last dlc state older race previous game got pretty influencial upgrade wh tw standard althou still problem power creep dlc much stronger one left untouched
update still seem focused mainly new old one get reworked already existing mechanic something made already game eq
cataclysm spell mirror madness mode
vanilla game better excluding faction still needing much love work supposed get sooner later long term damage done big bunch great commiunity mod longer updated
since ca tends mess game script update modded game experience negatively affected patchfixes add bug far still cant recommend going full game experience dlc full price
worth big sale
unce upon time old man stretching open anus revealing elden epic music delayed edition play game day later everybody called space marine press space roll
roll time hydra dominate enemy
incredible game got soul kind feel come combat exploration say quite open world game played soooo many secret find game easily hooked hour without pay win extra content sold sepretely make game
great gametook hour beat lot thing left undoneit quite unique say soul like elemnts combined rpg stuff definetly different typical soul like gamehas problem like hitboxes enemy sometimes garbage attack hit beacuse made take nasa pc run max setting otherwise game really good there fishing make aquarium game good friend wanted play day server already full advance wanted play together start another character big l playing friend game
edit ignore review bombing game amazing

audacity aggressive bashing disturbing supportive fostering idea exchange look culture pretty rough people disagree direction industry truth ultimately amazing game several thousand hour happy memory tw continue support choice want spend money never required base game free immortal empire update still one aggressive cool thing team hope see one another studio want know think done cool
ignore noise keep making cool stuff appreciate kislev
competitive matchmaking completely ruined cheater game hvh legit player caught middle gave update break seeing could improved c go whole cheating problem gotten point even want go near matchmaking
looking better mm experience faceit esea best bet
giving prime every user bought game total joke
danger zone bad expect cheater unfortunately free play user wish try c pretty much screwed update killed c go
point playing game start every week
try finger hole dog
overall gameplay average
combat boring due enemy mindless easy fight
might well melee everything death
game filled weird mix thing belong together like goofy cartoony pokemon thing also generic horror creature
top thing game take away resource weapon item start new season want get item back pay
waste time
overall fun game worth full price
game three mode campaign pvp
campaign mode fun short
several youtubers uploaded full playthrough hour
decent grindy come unlocks
pvp decent
two match team evenly matched
quite fun game one sided
overall fun game would recommend buying sale

weapon skin simulator game year bit disappointed short game
reason expected customization basic rpg campaign global aneurysm black myth wukong game also profound reinterpretation expression chinese culture game visuals breathtaking
every scene every blade grass filled intricate detail
whether lighting effect texture quality everything executed exceptional level craftsmanship
development team seamlessly blended ancient chinese landscape fantastical element mythology creating world feel familiar refreshingly combat system incredibly deep move designed extremely fluid enemy design also highly creative everything ordinary demon massive bos battle offering challenge require strategy term story game faithfully recreates classic episode journey west also incorporating wealth original content
wukong journey adventure spiritual quest many dialogue story element provoke deep music sound effect another highlight piece music perfectly setting mood intense battle peaceful village fully immersing game atmosphere
space marine preface saying list pro con biased entirely towards melee experience played assault religiously
love real difficulty artificial crap real stuff
payday dsod cataclysm onslaught darktide auric storm countless hellish experience
space marine absolutely ability deliver future current experience rough around edge longer play advance
despite believe game worth developer incredibly beautiful heartfelt experience developer actively listen respond community clearly care source material created beautiful graphic immerse combat click perfect parry perfect dodge gunstrikes beautiful execution
first hour play blow mind away mention difficulty initial learning curve critical flaw nuance pure melee experience day breaking put simple possible melee enemy beat use aforementioned mechanic alongside memorised combo add even small ranged unit shooting metre away dead probably second nothing skillful counter assault preferred class
assault easily weakest lack utility functionality worthwhile ability strongest efficient use assault simply stall run away chip get reinforcement
vanguard mogs assault played class melee efficiency immense measurable utility team
spongy nonreactive enemy roster mention take countless melee attack
give damn
thunderhammer face
care attack
jump pack attack charged attack
nah get insane dodge break tracking teleports actually send behind wall cover allow instantly counter attack unblockable flame attack suck astarte trash

thousand son roster take every con mentioned play hardest difficulty crank

overtuned
issue pure melee experience exasperated play assault
every majoris enemy teleport away kill melee becomes problem teleport pack different chaos marine
whittle slowly never able efficiently take though feel ballpark feel plain bad
least give way counter
irony extremis thousand son easier kill
yeah seriously really easily parry perfect dodge move finish teleport away
every single unit know know
spent entire second pressing nothing parry reacting jump
counterplay opportunity beyond option result health loss
actively disregard attack hyper armour wazoo
probs melta though looking chinese crap manufactorium unfortunately provide
instead power armour disintegrates even looked wrong way
feel resilient tanky slightest fact game played feel squishiest
like funny rat men
first launched game started playing tutorial think game bad
thought game play ok thought graphic pretty good aspect combat kind liked get world start playing around building noticed use memetics unlock build base incredibly frustrating ca build simple thing wall door without unlocking memetics first understand higher tier weapon base equipment even though easy unlock fact simply ca build basic thing like dumb
another thing like game fact locked one server
unable create new character forced play one server selected
sure feature changed future would play game
many hacker game brought back battle brother year hearing
game alone brought back brotherhood made u charge battle purge heretic xenos
praise emperor
god emperor made cahater scared start playing think okedit im ready play actually fun survival game get downvoted hell people falling basic fearmongering b great game
lot fun
lot replayability
good graphic although animation far realistic gameplay get old soon chapter
starting chapter storyline thin pretty much logical reason bos encounter
attention detail also lacking programming map basic action
""
invisible wall everywhere yet place character fall get stuck easily
fiore year game point start
recommend
product received free got potential rise category free survival open world multiplayer game
pro con always hope new idea patch future
would love co op mode honestly
pve server wipeout month much appreciated
elden ring one game need play least life
probably closest actual work art mixed combo fromsoft previous game music art direction perfect setting presented felt incredibly immersive
music feel though belongs movie dramatic beautiful sound
probably best fromsoft lineup game opinion
elden ring art direction also phenomenal every way
gripe although may opinion part area get tad redundant part recycle enemy idea section enough say bad
open world game also pretty interesting decent job making sure player always something course best vista seen game
honestly took little many screenshots good lmao
seeing part map could get made explore looking way get go rather straight shot destination game always threw number different thing would get sidetracked end going like three whole little adventure set
good open gameplay think great combo dark soul bloodbourn even sekiro thrown
fromsoft seems though wanted bring best older game one
really open world exploration brings interesting combat always keep toe amazing location allow exploration find different path area many goody find
story insane expect
game insanely good reading thinking getting game get
think get enjoy
trust
wont add shoulder swapping
shoulder swap implement shoulder swap need support melee animation transition everything melee combat made based fact hold pistol left hand melee weapon right hand look badass
nevertheless shoulder swap feature add
campaign badass pvp still need updating making party good story game bad pvp gamewill adjust review time per update good game performance unreal engine value way changing complete meme even lot eye torture dev get eye hdr triple game us unreal engine also quite pathetic
even sdr broken black level floor raise
really embarrassing
week reset hurt soul quality content falling since second game
bug base game existed year ignored favor releasing latest dlc doubled price compared previous one less content proportionally
graphic forget reality look long gameplay watch paint dry audio deaf audience grandma pc requirement check run rich ask nasa spare computer game size floppy old eat hard want entire hard drive hold need invest black hole hold data difficulty press easy learn hard significant brain dark soul grind nothing u care necessary average grind much need second life grinding story replace life game time long enough cup infinity beyond price free worth u spare money could also burn money bug never heard minor get ark survival game big terrarium bug
nearly hour decided go back older game warhammer fix
bug poor performance turned
example spent last minute watching cathay unit fail path find anywhere turn circle followed battle watched enemy troop clip wall barricade fail engage combat weirdly sliding past
going put one come back month ca recommend
love warhammer general collecting several tabletop army buying figurative bucket load warhammer digital game even super fan still ca get game kinda giving long play ca get like previous title
new dlc policy awful really awful new pack costing half game
overall give pas better choice previous title game
original review feb game launch boring hyped shallow mess as graphic optimization gameplay
top little fun either bland uninspired
due small unit roster look feel
extremely prevalent ogre fun faction game hope god release mortal empire soon seeing skaven orcs running around make want play
even get empire unit grand cathy caravan flavourful battle reminder total war three kingdom died half baked mess
thanks dropping ball caget sale stick
edited review oct released still boring hyped shallow mess bug less prevalent really look find base faction still bland opinion
still feel small
reason game saved immortal empire
bought wh dlc friend want play buy sale buy base game tw warhammer free dlcs fun way
base game wh faction either boring bland hard newcomer tw tw reminder total war three kingdom died half baked mess
thanks dropping ball ca best game best graphic ever
never enjoyed soul game untill played exellent gamevery bad executive like lot big compagnies video game spared ultra capitalism toxic devs insane price hike scitty dlc sale
good good game say still jank
character still need voice acting think
character emotes move mouth pick dialogue choice like silent mime
either silent protagonist give dumb need learn read
standard eula receive data provide since link social
government id china regulates much play video game require play game
rest standard online game
go read online game eula see many playing afterwards
goated added operation myth legend
bruh got new dlcs gameanxiety disorder including panic disorder disorder bipolar disorder mood stress disorder including schizophrenia
overall really solid game thing holding got excellent combat system allows level skill expression use everything game give wukong none feel ability trivialize encounter
skill tree system well done allows create playstyle fit ability player reset free encourages main focus game level mob enemy design sacrificed favor
level smashing weak mob enemy reach bos
design inherently bad would loved see engaging enemy creative placement enemy better environment design invisible developer making game scale first time definitely got lot thing right
elding ring every team consists russian guy speaks
year old kid slept much salt с ка бли т enough kurvvawould love take another dose salt punch little brother game completely totally free
whole gacha system people complaining via wish machine farmed boss higher tier enemy within understand negative criticism coming lack controller support eu server game really good starry studio one responsible game high hope loved demo still love game
joined arm race still used best total war game play daily going purchase lord pack
lot player seem hate siege battle let make battle siege battle
probably
edit alright immortal empire mod get rid minor settlement battle recommend total warhammer iii
win
good combat probably one best genre nice story much story warhammer one best art direction without counting coop pve pvp even better
good time increase price taken step lightly
however business reality supporting warhammer iii ensuring able offer year extra content currently planned
actual reality situation burned last bit community goodwill
game derive enjoyment legendary campaign difficulty hard battle difficulty anymore think finally leave well rounded definitely one game wish steam neutral review option
give idea thought coming thousand hour across total war series started decade ago middle school medieval easily diverse franchise far variety race roster one incredibly good modding scene
battle cinematic get game beautiful max setting
entry franchise also robust multiplayer campaign player slot going medieval iii multiplayer campaign please
variety lord hero school magic tech tree race allows variety playstyles well
however really illusion choice come legendary lord bread butter point stat buff get perk research steamroll army composed unit supposed counter
agent hero time incorporated army objectively better battlefield unit campaign map purpose beaten multiple legendary campaign without utilizing agent campaign map even feel show lack impact side option instead absolutely essential well rounded play
siege settlement battle honestly feel like downgrade previous title
medieval ii perfectly citadel dedicated military settlement entirely different city etc
game multiple scenario attack lord get free destroy castle wall button right beginning battle
inherent strong advantage defender siege situation game facilitate largest issue game suffers plague essentially every game genre way need point difficulty scaling
ai dumb
want make game harder
give every cheat known man stats wise
thing ai really know attack move entire army
even legendary regularly send full stack death initiating battle even chance winning mean battle way mean autoresolve split favor ai still attack reason game fun continue experiment mod play friend ask come crack formula really situation really campaign turn would continue sake reaching tedious win condition long victory
vary wildly wood elf norsca beyond annoying complete whereas chaos dwarf beat legendary campaign zhatan black hour
core gameplay loop see essentially solve first turn puzzle legendary lord start able consistently illusion depth game shatters left quick minute conquering end turn simulator sweep recommend game warhammer lore one favorite universe done extreme justice
game definitely enjoyable point mastered get money worth time
however even diverse cast boring due lack actual challenge
hitting start campaign feel meaningless opinion know chance actually losing
checking see whether game worth price game fun plenty replayability base game alone entitles small fraction content game need sink lot money overpriced dlc
always buy discount aware around quarter game faction unlocked buying game trilogy even buy dlc strategy gamer wondering whether good buy yes normal price expect game play like historical total war game
total war game darwinian high fantasy setting gameplay adapted well
game set world warhammer fantasy old tabletop game mostly exists nowadays collection licensed video game wo need read sourcebooks little story explained much written game
short game take place pastiche world somewhere industrial revolution several century bc magic polytheism looming invasion demon demon cultist ratmen stereotypical fantasy specie pasted race european chinese
warhammer analogue america populated race backstabbing slaver became psychopath turned majestic brother overseas get torturing people
take player historical total war might find gameplay feel agree personally find less realistic design philosophy cause visualize battle two set stat block crashing arbitrary configuration rather test wit two force whose unit behave intuitively according appearance
hand intuition inherently go window degree game balance determined tabletop game designer rather collection military record good reason human mind disinclined believe loosely arranged mob naked people whip hope defeat equal quantity heavy infantry zweihänders
fan naval battle know game naval gameplay despite playable pirate vampire coast viking norsca british people high elf
ship game transport fleet army store ass time next siege ladder two opposing army meet sea agree park nearby island disembark fight land
closest thing navy game dark elf black ark mobile settlement provide ground troop shore bombardment friendly game campaign launch tutorial excepted realm chaos race major faction invade titular realm reach wounded god ursun taking place along northern latitude world
main attraction total war warhammer iii however immortal empire traditional total war campaign combine three campaign map total war warhammer trilogy one large map spanning almost entire warhammer fantasy world
campaign contains faction though majority minor npc faction exist trampled absorbed playable faction world race diverse fight plenty playable faction radically different playstyles campaign mechanic
every race different core strategy battle different approach strategic map emphasize different mechanic
within race faction distinct gimmick intended encourage different us unit roster change player diplomatic priority
feel comfortable saying every faction game feel unique play rome rome almost always better realpolitik set war goal instead dividing world enemy future expect drop several hundred dollar dlc game integrated content previous game trilogy interested playing anyone cathay fantasy imperial china kislev fantasy imperial russia daemon chaos fantasy florida
got total war game like would recommend picking first game trilogy yes base game unlock accessible race immortal empire game
reikland couronne ease gameplay familiar player historical total war vampire count force adapt
also consider buying second game unlock knight caledor objectively best faction
owning three game without buying dlc unlock around two third immortal empire playable race
faction within race remain paywalled enough content get feel would advise keep firm grip wallet around trilogy
one dlc controversial among consumer high price thin content developer made grand number pr blunder although recently working reverse reputation releasing new content shadow change dlc
however build dlc library adapt faction gimmick easily hour gameplay seen factor purchase decision feel need mention mod given critical experience playing game
brief primer quite lost choose get modding scene steam workshop rich selection mod add new playable faction unique mechanic revamp minor faction unique leader gimmick
community best ensure mod mostly every mod author bother one particular person edit behalf enjoy seeing many mod stuff game without breaking
aware owner warhammer ip allow workshop content referencing ip outside warhammer fantasy mod add either original content canon content appear vanilla
mixu unlocker victory condition overhaul hero legend suite faction mod team ovn essential even looking heavily modded experience
mod double game playtime expect mod carry game sold vanilla install sfo grimhammer unless fancy begging compatibility patch whenever want use mod
consider downloading warhammer mod manager intend play handful mod make hell lot easier figure mod crashing game causing summary good game last long time different design philosophy historical game
faction variety unparalleled
deep pool mod choose pack lot content one playthrough long know
need make lot purchase get full experience however dlc pack counting plus previous game trilogy prepared wait sale look discounted steam key interest notice directly contributed content hero legend
game absolute banger
give acces source please game good uw support change
could dog
update broke game cant get siege battle without freezing forced restart
game like game fun challenging like soul related game
great time game
complex compared game like
soul related game meant hard complex great way people learn opinion
boss game requires learning attack discovering weakness
love game seriously tired trend releasing game
progress made offline mode redacted moment return online mode time lock content reward received offline mode

omg got many
""
dlc price almost half base game worth content coverage
everything turned siege battle
absolutely hate
personally think field battle heart soul warhammer way fun
long time total war warhammer player hugely disappointed direction adapted game developer regard pinnacle trilogy
long known bug issue ignored luckily mod creator fantastic job fixing
patch cycle saw included free high quality additional content discontinued ca post last year point single person working patch although may fully criticize new pricing policy regard dlcs may simply pay think worth money something seems true shocked subtle threat made developer discontinue support community respond positively new dlcs opinion empty threat disrespectful fan community nevertheless love series hope ca return deliver high quality content
although strategy fan experience amazing series shadow change dlc controversy feel wrong recommend game new player
basically upgrade original space marine every way
content combat option visual spectacle microtransactions run well
minor bug encountered gameplay also issue seeming stem crossplay server function server issue seem worked recommended
normally dont review game holy ca everything power deserve money game blast play lack real support overpriced dlc leaf really sour taste mouth
wholeheartedly recommend black myth wukong fan game
title become true addiction
bos encounter tested patience recognize matter improving skill trial error
game masterful work art inspired classic chinese novel journey west yet telling story unique captivating way
every scene every battle every chapter presented stunning visual spectacle impossible drawn beauty
rich content black myth wukong offer deeply immersive experience anticipated dlc horizon eagerly looking forward diving back challenge even greater adventure
titus beating allegation game
game changed perspective life
want evolve back monke
optimization joke
playing game everyday week hardly issue
suddenly patch update fix crashing graphic problem
longer play game
even dropping pc potato graphic ca run game
husband supreme liquid component would obviously go even run game high setting
need optimization asap absolutely bloody glorious emperor
ultramar
greatest series game time
unparalleled replayablity
really enjoy vacation greed downfall
recommend game right fps inconsistency heavy stuttering giving headache nausea
shame probably one best game ever released edit patch update getting used stutter drop less common launch one best game ever released still lacking optimization
controller support
diversivity woman main character transgender fantastic game suffers open world syndrome quantity quality game least loot good
quest pretty interesting way time fairly rewarding follow questlines
bos fight part easier previous soul game however case difficult especially use ash summons intend definitely encourage use however reuse really bad game ranging simply reusing enemy previous game reusing main story big bad moveset random dungeon reusing enemy new game except two oh three oh common enemy
horse also strong honestly add much game besides allowing platform higher case game still fun like soul game exactly soul except different name much bigger better worse scale
new weapon move set neat also added huge amount sorcery well weapon art swap around
played span three week blissfully enjoyed different aspect game threaded together happy harmony adventure survival fight quest teamwork realization realized sunk progress would destroyed nay less month today broke tear silently playing along happily ignorant friend came crushing realization life world meaningless simple cycle nihilism naught quest come repetitive end walking simulator refuse walk merry go round fun memory covering turmoil misery hellish existence like thin layer frosting well expired cake fun adventurous game
pull feel many game
manages give new fresh take
core mechanic familiar
managed add overwhelming game play
open world freedom run character add fresh new layer game play used similar game
enemy diverse spread added world blended well
enhanced graphic previous title make atmosphere feel relaxing ominous cycle weather
game definitely easy insanely difficult
said suck pretty bad game
take time patience entertain go vast open world
def sponsor p monke need say
ckc margitt god actuaaly like design hwe hard e lest fugging goooooooooo beat as yeeeeeeeeee haaaaaaaaaawwww he weak monke finally game made
absolute
awful price policy pr ca buy dlc kill support
thanks ca coolupdate seems change tune fixed mistake
game pretty good season system work game isnt one game p c go amazing experience stunning visuals must buy play
wtf free
""
buy game use
finished cathay campaign
two strong impression
siege battle feel much fun new settlement map supply mechanic build defense structure
""
quest battle also enjoyable capture multiple victory point hold enemy wave meanwhile supply point build defense structure call reinforcement unit
downside battle quite long new siege battle definitely fun defending
build defense structure like tower trap barricade
new settlement map huge complex pathway many interesting choke point
open many interesting strategy turn defeat heroic victory
able win many outnumbered defense battle holding crucial choke point maneuver army multiple line defense wear enemy
cathay crossbow felt strong positioned higher ground melee unit hold enemy
downside battle sometimes long big new map attacker feel harder play take supply point defender constantly build tower trap etc
quest battle also interesting
capture several location sequentially capture sec build defense layout army coming enemy wave
battle super fun need play attacker defender capture point enemy defend trying take back
also call reinforcement heal restock buff unit using supply point passively generated
map also huge interesting terrain choke point leverage either hold point push enemy defense
final battle also interesting mechanic xd annoying fun subjective
constant spawning enemy troop behind taking first point
forcing take next victory point quickly hold enemy chasing behind
""
random enemy teleport onto final victory point soulgrinders middle army
scared hard since giant nonstoppable monstrous machine started spawning running crossbow end
downside still battle feel long easily optimization honestly feel similar total war warhammer ii occasional fps drop especially campaign
experience anything major stopped playing
bug encounter rift closed somehow reopened reloaded save file next day
able enjoying game really expect optimization improvement
long run fine warhammer ii whenever mortal empire whatever call aggregation warhammer ii iii come game still run totally fine current state optimization
first enjoy strategy game fantasy game warhammer total war title general almost sure enjoy game
easily sink hundred hour total war warhammer especially buy right additional content
three game combined around hour good conscience recommend dumpster fire game unless find absolutely game enjoy
unfortunately rotten core see way developer fix
sincerely hope future game better job one deserve time
ask
well side gameplay glaringly inadequate
first game capturing settlement army
constitutes campaign goal grow empire make money etc
battle using said army said settlement probably best feature game
right
wrong
battle bad even trying write right make furious
variety battle amazing cause poorly programmed ai army flounder often
field battle enemy unit try repeatedly get new formation neither defending incursion advancing
somehow less competent higher battle difficulty
get hang often destroy whole army elite troop couple unit
battle taking place settlement
think could justice awful ai becomes
take word suggest watch gameplay online demonstrates debaucle plenty video stream
layout settlement also boggles mind
every infantry unit feature magically appearing ladder aptly dubbed community butt ladder making wall trivial design already pretty senseless
inside settlement fixed spot build barricade tower using vague resource accumulate time
location defense absolutely insane like tower blocked building side rendering useless pathfinding would considered terrible even game year old called victory point oh god bad
bad
even simplest tower defense flash game better design battle even supposed like tower defense battle
supposed reflect real siege battle reasonable fashion
""
""
""
battle actually badly received community one update removed settlement battle replaced field battle
campaign management also laughably stupid
campaign total war game never par major turn based strategy title like civilization course series also supposed feature amazing real time battle
warhammer series dumbed lower imaginable
though mechanic introduced overpriced paid dlcs interesting basic feature largely unimaginative lazy
call crazy think essential part strategy game least halfway decent without pay additional content
diplomacy mostly joke one deal hundred make requires strategical thinking
admittedly better higher quality forced waste less time thanks quick diplomacy option
race first second game either update adjust third game said update function properly clear lackluster skill line older character missing feature mechanic incompatible insufficient adjustment new diplomacy option interaction faction etc
real thought put faction play together new game
like comparing well made article clothing one weird patch clearly see patch belong make cloting seem cheap unattractive
mention many update game receives work
dozen critical issue developer claimed fixed patch turned blatant lie like five time row
refuse believe testing releasing update
remains buttload important problem yet even acknowledge
probably fun game despite issue
course likely get bored fatigued campaign mid game either start new campaign get good stuff stop playing
happens player
campaign great cinematic experience better friend low point think rat section mission downtime section cave ok bit significantly less emphasis melee short experience much interest quickly lost interest played lot round grind class unlock interesting weapon
operation mission launch terrible game world war z launch past needed early balance seemed place
higher difficulty fewer resource sometimes placement ammo crate felt similar tactical survival experience back blood world war z maybe like playing remnant build instead using build
regardless difficulty mission rng aspect event requiring ration ammo specific part certain mission try use environment equipment find optimally possible explosive barrel explosive flower level gimmick fire wall end first mission becomes bullet spongy higher difficulty numerous less resource spawning medicae stims healing less hp
different weapon type seem different effectiveness v specific enemy
running away next elevator despawn enemy behind cheesy class balance seemed place need play sure seems bug hidden effect bulwark using loadout change pod banner phasing lift mission
example balance stuff certain class ammo generation perk later class weapon perk line seems mandatory pick compared option bulwark level perk restores max contested health squadmates aoe allowing fully heal combined enemy finisher level perk share squadmates anywhere substantially reduces need healing item seems like mandatory pick compared option weapon high damage per shot hit multiple enemy heal past contested health
melta rifle la fusil etc use currency buy weapon class perk space marine chapter customization always feel poor progressing initially class expensive weapon
assault
also need grind class weapon trying get armory data unlock next tier weapon first time tougher usual need play higher tier previous tier weapon
finally play immortal empire without spend game great game great story line combat intense give satisfying feeling mission long overall great game emperor
spent entire working week platinum game downside game lot invisible wall map pretty confusing
started playing csgo depressed motivated anything hated job know game totally changed mind opened new chapter life
finally found something good help reduce become addiction stop playing game even got fired bos late tired work
care job suck become potatoe jobless still opening case get knife hoping get payday played ﾚ ノ ヽ 丿 ノ lﾉ played ノ ノ ノ ヽ ーﾉ 丶 彡 gay see enemy shoot miss almost every shot enemy turn around one tap damage given hit best game ever product received free game came hour ago already many hacker almost impossible play game everyone immortal aimbots brother
crusade waiting
one must imagine skarbrand happy
begin
back got revealed total war warhammer step new direction total war albeit one unusual since warhammer mod total war game
warhammer frequently huge army clashing even whilst may individual unit still fit
however massively risky move since departure historical total war tww still rough way know lot time keep coming back playing
attribute fact weakness also strength
also attribute fact practically currently best warhammer rts game actually fantasy battle even old world fantasy battle setting like whfb warhammer fantasy battle age sigmar controversial something still love stomach dlc list access multitude character shone spotlight became big money maker character still age sigmar radically different point many feel unfitting
next best part game incredibly diverse
access faction never tabletop lore
norsca whole split various chaos faction vampire coast exist dreadfleet lore character best cathay never anything beyond mysterious land like one two unit third edition playable character play exist time period ic boris ursus died repanse died year
little handwave back incredible play
even character lore table top figure utilize lord nakai lizardmen practically book lizardmen rule little flavor warhammer overjoyed fair sure many lord always land tretch craventail may well exist ca added mini much else already getting planed added fun everything going major w minor battle course huge highlight
want say every form fighting total war game sufficiently different others franchise
ranged formation empire napoleon vast field battle shogun seem recreate samurai movie warhammer offer lot magic various army clashing course lack total war game mean snide way mean there whole new layer strategy added
say various army clashing think skaven basically mad science faction v bretonnia much medieval era legend king arthur faction tech progress come
come strategy tactic beat enemy account trump bretonnians skaven go without saying course total war game tech level sans maybe drastic difference real world group best part game though need know anything warhammer
find game stuff anything
need know anything go blind learn way
sans dlc list accessible game nerd like oasis franchise thats become space marine sigmarines believe lot love stem enjoyment total war franchise
praise review try game
summer game great state
playing since past decade total war warhammer treat
please fix magic ladder war community alright immortal empire hard chinese algebra
rewarding getting asked prom
double checkuncountable number
moment
triple checkcauses ask playing long
infinite checkworthy time money
hockey check spectacular con regular thing graphic using much memory
sure know game show much vram used based current setting
tlou
game make guess
even using nvidia geforce optimized setting still unstable
setup amd ryzen ghz geforce rtx msi trio gb vram skill mhztuf gaming mball driver updatedhaving game crash fighting tough bos aggrevating
http slap sorry needed review random game summer sale sticker collection mission btw good game u friend play going start con honestly realm chaos campaign took fun game
enjoy race demon rift
prefer objective like newer faction got
never played one vortex race much either
everything seems bare bone thing excited ended boring draining minor settlement siege chaos realm massive battle realm
extremely disappointed ca gw something including araby even though much requested many people still often requested
lore character land game would sell like hotcake different aesthetic current race
yet wo bring game unknown pro love warhammer total war
series match made heaven played game series ever
love new faction ogre kingdom desired faction
love kislev like idea cathay even though pretty bare bone roster
every faction feel unique others campaign play aesthetic
potential
got new minor race hope get araby southern realm ind khuresh etc
recommend game current state
maybe try back year large map released faction fleshed
masterpiece beautiful game
worth wait
right discus entitlement earn playing game congratulation whomever decided would good idea write aforementioned quote
outstanding display strategic communication
created dissension fan
hopefully allowed discus matter pay new privilege dlc measly
yet completed game posting review people need game great issue related gameplay degrade experience much honestly ca recommend current unlike earlier software game us easyanticheat causing issue many player including
often eac popup show game window never show
somewhat reliable workaround delete easyanticheat folder inside game file game compatdata directory using linux verifying game local file
steam correct eac file game able user experiencing different problem eac crash getting stuck screen inappropriate activity detected error etc without good able get game started faced second major issue issue pc version nevertheless major issue need hardware game fails maintain steady especially open area
sometimes framerate drop worst case
closed area steady possible game deserves thumb ca give issue solved edit seems like savefile got deleted
started game presented new game option main menu
continue load game option sight
apparently thing edit game performance issue solved eac still causing problem
fun toxic player rise son guilliman finishing campaign write review get thought paper review contain spoiler story talk theme gameplay performance
together course overall impression start thing
space marine exceeded expectation significant margin game really really fun play
seen review talking combat system unforgiving say disagree
fast pace melee ranged blend really satisfying figure work
played game second highest difficulty first run far adjust beginning got hurdle quite frankly saw improving getting better managing fight
extent fight game feel reminiscent doom specifically eternal
every fight puzzle need think creatively solve together staying top incoming attack positioning
complaint ai valid notice much term getting way fun
performance wise running fairly old rig got stable performance albeit exceptional high preset
fine game run long stable space marine depending level either running stable stable stable unstable
range later game really flexing muscle term scale number effect screen
stuff epic integration
quite literally accept eula
impact gameplay
find complaint around sort stuff valid exaggerated
okay upset forced upon think warrant leaving negative review game personally
story
feel like could novel
say significant praise compared first game stake higher character better feel like part actual canon
incredibly satisfied depending game develops next year might firmly take spot personal favorite game however
firmly top say strongly recommend game diving multiplayer component next day anything add detract review expect addendum addendum found review stance hold firm
absolute cinema ever dipped toe warhammer universe mostly friend hobby game based universe darktide inquisitor martyr
despite little knowledge thoroughly enjoyed campaign felt invested titus story gameplay fairly solid nothing revolutionary game current state good base content importantly great potential built
look forward playing seeing come game future
slightly bigger map faction bought
advertised new faction come game buy
played half campaign small list
run unit unit almost resistance mean effectively front
ogre ca knocked weird watching one tank cannon shot face immediately shoot unique stance
drastically reduces unit performance major mechanic faction make worse decide use
ranged unit targeting issue
seemingly without reason unable fire target within plain view
ranged unit sometimes decide melee charge another unit instead order shoot
large drop performance portal open campaign
certain quest battle crash game try first
calvary charge usually annihilate unit formation real logic
heavily armored cav charge less warhammer regular empire swordsman charge light cav send chaos knight unit flying air several second completely scatter formation
something clearly wrong way mass
spell balance
noticed spell ok previous title wiping unit destroying formation
looking pendulum
cutscenes copy paste
jarring watching cut scene different faction leader
""
chaos invasion make occasionally ill fighting army single town one turn fight next turn battered army
incredibly
dealing corruption chore different type ridiculous wait see modding community able fix issue
pay dlc price game feel like
dlc campaign right discus entitlement earn playing game ca pr department game got boob as slider lot thing forgive example matched russian since griefers derankers kid screaming mic wannabe dj sounding like elephant walking dp skin cost much merc ranking adjustment one sin ca wo forgive removing aztecits year bring map back bastard
far love everything game
story visuals gameplay beautiful game chinese mythology rare gem
world visuals stunning although exploration linear want see everything game offer
also first game chose play default english sound much better original voice chinese make unique soul inspired difficulty forgiving
button dodge attack right time
also dying wo loose anything enemy respawn dying resting
game hard noob casuals like give try
however still challenging boss make die
ca rush mash button expecting die hit
said may adapt skill point thankfully respec cost anything freedom try different summarize amazing singleplayer game right interesting story great gameplay amazing visuals sound effect
optimization good
play old pc gtx bit tweaking
great purchase fantastic game
δύσκολο έχει game major technical downgrade erapublisher major ethical downgrade era played csgo since best fps esport title ever
valve really much anymore
still gon na give good review tho
reject modern audience return monke
greedy af dlc monetization game warhammer
grim dark story good introduces titus got turned primaris obvious culture war question woke violent satisfying
similar experience recently batman arkham knight
challenging
countering dodging learning pattern etc simplified play titus feel like space marine
power melee attack ripping enemy limb limb
shaking footstep weight behind every step
thunderous boom much armour meat bone muscle hit ground jumping game hardest difficulty challenging
still determining possible finish playing solo bot
edit seems possible challenging
would suggest angel death difficulty dedicated also satisfying ca completely relied engaging melee nearly mandatory swarm close impressive faithfully great involved fighting give feeling dark fit theme
main theme game start actually sent chill back
awe inspiring quick look operation endless war mode provide plenty replay operation thoroughly enjoyable
levelling fun satisfying become powerful perk better weapon armour skin beautiful
artist really put effort technical performance game running beautifully
rtx ram ssd window
ultra setting native resolution taa give frame
lowest frame experienced far graphically intensive portion
considering hardware high end performance surprising show game well optimised opinion
game practically ooze effort work developer put game definitely worth fan saying epic
game make use epic online service
app core component allow crossplay steam epic well needed file easy anti cheat
epic account required started game none created aware couple technical issue ca figure sometimes voice line normal barely audible subtitle much problem playing without strain hear
glaring problem called nothing keep cheater ruining game others
alone enough spoil entire experience pve join friend campaign still looking solution
update review find one find cause
edit able join friend today retry attempt connecting reliable sometimes crash glitch thus far exception sometimes save seems glitch restart checkpoint lower ammo different primary one chose along mission med health reached checkpoint
happened severance mission activating generator ripper swarm gaunts zoanthropes warrior mobbing
unknown exactly happens cause glitch
game made punch closet anger many time
would highly recommend lay bonafides since every negative review instantly spammed gud cringe beat ed every dark soul game
done speedruns challenge run whole lot
call thing elden ring hard lack experience
elden ring lot minor flaw sparse armor early game jank teleporting field boss boring crafting boring catacomb hundred spirit flower never use basically forgive game start honestly halfway development budget totally fall every area corridor full enemy alone
placement feel almost random time get tilting fast
entire lategame subcontinent three grace
mean die wolf patrolling archer horde cross entire thing
two area nearly bad point sprinting viable totally forgive bad level
every game larger boss feel like pulling beat every shardbearer major bos find least two literally unplayable
one early game easily cheesable starscourge radahn one lategame entirely unforgiveable malenia blade miquella
latter attack almost entirely undodgeable tell help foot away take second
shardbearers get semifinal bos damage sponge every attack entire phase every attack aoe phase grab machine instakill comical grab hitboxes beat get honor fighting final bos first phase followed ridiculous final phase full nonsense childlike idea cool final bos singlehandedly ruined belief writer plan endgame
like cool final bos phase one radagon got swapped idea elden like ridiculous soul cinder parody
comical humiliating damage sponge taken care get pick ending
effectively two one obviously bad third choice literally burn entire world overall leave little idea ending choice even mean world really done first place
yay
game done
hour feel totally numb ambivalent lot thing talk like finnicky quest become open world
think worst thing say spent elden ring planning new run build idea beaten
feel tired let
ost slap love torrent well lot npc
hug woman say love life actually precisely one thing comment like add review
see anyone saying elden ring ending let break basic ending
ending
bad ending
three ending
basic ending color filter cutscene single word dialogue changed
nothing new added amount become god become god bad grey become god bad red become god catholic
feel like extremely late addition highlight vapid difference ending really
meaningless enough elden ring basically three learned writing game feature field bos literally first shardbearer
dude trailer show field different name fight
elden ring copypasting problem seriously everpresent touched much deserves especially considering mandatory catacomb game
fun one run second playthrough really prefer spirit tuning component distributed throughout fun part game
game good played cbts far queue lining simulatori love sink teeth game server wipe feel nice survival craft main ark valheim conan exile icarus etc
devs figure way release server server wipe nice
already decay system place combat abandoned player someone hundred hour various survival craft game combined game tiring
season wipe feel nice game genre
liked game really liked shame found thing changed every game use data
put taskmanger startup thing changing every devicewhy good game stuff
wipe
survival game understandable like pve game pvp cuz pvp case whice event press p purevingits real shamge guy ball elden ring
played lot dark soul say really happy game came still thing feel unfair encounter specifically designed annoy rather challenge still think great experience
imperium space marine
first thing first huge fan wait steep discount
best part game art direction simply superb
managed capture atmosphere bad part gunplay suck primaris marine cant hit broad side barn bolter bolter suck
look like explodes stagger enemy creates small splash effect bolter suck
barely ammunition
melee suck
basic weapon boring use moment moment gameplay suck every mission
go area swarm spawn kill swarm destroy lever
almost hour gameplay nothing else inside mission
story barebones
icing cake million lore error
negro ultramarine incorrect astarte greeting wrong bolters etc finally control setup console peasant
also game greedy live service model come day season pas
tldr wait get alternative source
playy aand slayyy craft masterpiece one must avoid counsel sweetbaby sun tzu probably core game enjoyable however price dlc almost half cost game
even come enough content justify price tag
obvious tactic ca using see much community shill money order see much scrape bottom barrel abandoning game
point click
would fun could get big game campaign friend work properly without desync good internet
stupid happens turn based game

ca pulling ea putting garbage lack content overpriced dlcs
said full confidence ca overwatch clone bomb turnaround support game
happens buy game especially buy dlcs
slaughter innocent rabbit summon demon serial killer rabbit bring food good review privilege
ca support company crapping customer supported
outside cpu getting hotter game run really well doesnt denuvo result pretty stable far
also ultramar game good room extra polish story good power trip content feel challenging tool
gimmick wear thin even solo duo trust bot deal main damage ripper segment
thankfully segment far
pvp also fun match enjoyable even though mode pretty biggest complaint right fact pvp map pool map
road map indicates new map mean month grinding current small pool
slow pace unlocking gear pvp see point burnout people
also pvp match really need shuffle team two three man queue snipe doom stack lobby
general flow around menuing pvp also kinda clunky amount load screen waiting
instance ca edit loadout match must finish game load battle barge go armory wait robo boy slowly come timer tick next match
point even bother loading barge could menu flip post match
point load screen god pain
know best computer even friend faster rig long load time getting connected crate shenanigan monke play monke gamevery fun play poor siege battle highly recommend
combat fluid pair amazingly use spell
achievement hunter heavily explore everywhere collect everything
probably need guide collect curio soak armor drop
nothing tell drop game
overall game extremely enjoyable
difficult time unfair
good timing requirement
absolutely love game played heck released xbox gamepass since removed
gripe purchased dlc pack xbox store carry purchase play steam
also game cost cad get content
locked behind purchasing warhammer ii guess still cost cad able access full game game get thumb really wish meh option

dream becoming monkey finally come true fun definitely worth dollar
maybe catch sale
feeling wo wait long since mission game lol
elden ring delicious late afternoon wine cracker platter sweltering sun cooled spring breeze relaxing backyard music
wine good elden ring intoxicating addicting aromatic fruity yet aged perfection
cracker difficulty hard rough gritty perhaps little tough bite
heck cracker platter stiff unpalatable could hardtack
crunch elden ring cracker overcome lathering thick layer cream cheese
much cheese apply cracker come learn right way enjoy wine
idea much cheese like
enjoy much cheese cracker becomes obscured perhaps might well
enjoy cracker dry compliment complex blend wine either case find like game enjoy

bug major one like whole system warhammer worked
unplayable siege total garbage even compared warhammer biggest issue game game big selling point reworked siege probably biggest one campaign feeling got worse
ai completely incompetent anything strange coding based previous game way better run deplete miserable force hardly prove challenge
give awful experience like turn steamroll every campaign without thought autoresolving almost every provide fun get way warhammer ca recommend considering rumor around game get worse
game year doubt dlc win game year game high rate accuracy perfect way anyone disagrees complaining
monkeybusiness depending want game either looking game element mass effect maybe rogue trader story ai game people want old game back action based third person shooter blood gore
people enjoyed first game even gow blast different execution gunplay overall presentation space marine feel really good sit join friend blast way tyranid horde watching custom made space marine cutting warrior campaign taste long enough amazing moment certain twist expecially presentation battlefield skybox look complete level design something another get sucked world blink eye even intro video sweetest eye candy year end go massive scaled battle taking place background ambiente fit well setting fluent yet operation exactly expected love different perspective level view team give another nice inside war xenos would loved similiar kind pve gameplay like darktide might would suit game add something like repetitive like darktide inspired say class feel unique way play feel hand done right player play game buying get people like get easy way sometimes honestly way like space marine get wrong really love fan service warhammer game believe game good halo reach term said fan multiplayer although need lot work unfortunately true customisation chaos marine make quite sad love full world eater set different part armour insignia wait far know counter

would nominate game year
major issue entity loading
player model enemy terrain feature
straight unplayable happens time work great sometimes want love pretty bad
clear well minimum requirement patch
shall finest warrior men give
like clay shall mould furnace war forge
iron steely muscle
great armour shall clad mightiest gun armed
untouched plague disease sickness blight
tactic strategy machine foe best battle
bulwark terror
defender humanity
space marine shall know fear
emperor mankind
overall really good game played lot even got buddy normally play fps like
old fashion game still prefer may think smooth ad pretty
overnight completely removed access c go replaced update
big deal completely removed several game mode exclusively play casually
want get popular gamemodes even casual everyone total sweat
like sit back every play arm race
suddenly game exist anymore c go used nice chill passtime nothing bring back feature
one thing discontinue less popular mode whatever suddenly random update warning completely ridiculous
dead meme
like woke dead shoot againedit vac failing community plzvalve fair play monkey care selling dlc making ai work

reason enemy able take city city replenishing troop whole way along cant catch even forced march
waste time play completely ruined ai relies blatant cheating stay clown award lmao
imagine cheerleading corpos
mad mad mad
sad sad sad
call one time
release immortal empire campaign absolutely recommend game bear mind need previous game many dlcs play faction lord surreal good game
best fps game turned trash masterpiece much fun much wow note game need pretty beefy pc least current state maybe optimize better stutter gpu bellow series
review besides bad pc optimization stutter seem occur worst possible moment game would consider beautiful byproduct zelda breath wild dark soul spent night inn raining outside
open world case empty kind exploring actually reward
cant count number time god forsaken corner map actually found hidden loot
meanwhile also present player challenge like boss significantly harder dark soul
right ending nowhere site honestly even want see
game hand best game played last five year
note massive dark soul fan boy may bias
would definitely recommend anyone love d exploration game
good game pain write given hype behind long awaited capstone title
say fully upfront preordered burden bear mine
marketing nice shiny appeared ca hitting lot note towards genuinely improving upon last two game
well game drop ndas lifted quickly became apparent many apart iconic creative assembly launch bug main campaign time writing review fun
played warhammer ii getting vortex campaign worse
accurately like playing tomb king campaign every book nagash get make game artificially harder give reward access said book legendary lord location retrieve book give crippling debuffs force lord sit capital effectively removing one army play indeterminate amount time
game expecting complete objective breakneck pace grossly biased cheating ai
oh discouraged expanding territory perhaps total war patch supposedly coming week address issue mechanically make game enjoyable
take realm tzeentch example section
minimum time player complete realm think turn
ai make realm forget objective lost
ai hard coded always complete section absolute minimum amount time sometimes even less
one campaign enemy completed section two turn go back breakneck pace mentioned
siege another sly trick marketing campaign convinced would improved simply far many issue ai pathing terrain unit responsiveness called defense provided form tower
good tower built erected right piece terrain piece fortress wall
mean one side tower completely useless sliver angle fire
problem interwoven cheating ai pay supply cost build tower tower build instantly
case player make sort tactical play destroying key defensive structure totally bunk
speak anything negative regard optimization performance machine
experience one crash end turn running fine
even without issue
odd rig much beefier mine seem disproportionately affected course unacceptable
however still plagued gate bug cavalry charge feeling powerful slaanesh chariot working correctly new one introduced chaos map
unit disappear get stuck invisible lava bridge khorne settlement
couple snow map weird flickering issue bright irritate wanted add small section small section player base
enjoyed occasionally hopping quick battle back warhammer ii
whatever reason creative assembly decided push mean push new multiplayer domination game mode rtt style capture point resource etc
hate mode pushed point player could longer use quick search feature land battle
could play new ranked game mode unless course set private lobby
lobby total broken first week two game release
good luck finding match tweak search filter caused lobby dissappear
going forward absolutely need quick match feature domination land battle
want enjoy multiplayer time time creative assembly stripped away choice player haughtily assured lot would make total war warhammer good game
genuinely good quality life change diplomacy new faction fun different play style
sensation get large army clashing one another still achieved time time
daemon prince customization lot potential future content current state weak
idea thinking recommending first campaign show mechanic way many enemy deal
saying someone hour warhammer ii someone playing first total war title
prologue campaign excellent tutorial completely new player also prof creative assembly competently make gripping narrative total war campaign
take issue everything ui shade red time getting rid lot flavorful art gave menu life
went rigid efficient approach ca fault
red
new trait defeating lord totally lackluster
auto resolve crap shoot
unit mass ruined entirely
core open beta expected pay think even suggesting warhammer ii expansion little generous
creative assembly making one best release year right lap arrogance shelled key influencers called ignore feedback criticism prior launch
wo even touch debacle china need maintain rating reach broader market
land blood good river blood fountain blood blood daemon everything combatant allowed bleed
get started titty daemon
player fallen dramatically finally getting patch roughly month half launch
patch fix add thing day one
thus state modern gaming
preordered game cynically knowing back mind getting
brand new series
get game lest creative assembly somehow step pedestal offer immortal empire everyone owns game regardless two
warned complete total war warhammer experience run although sale prevalent counting future dlc planned game assuming still willing give tlc need ax like three kingdom going got tough
fan warhammer series two title
best bet waiting immortal empire could june
lot need happen meantime
obvious none important bit playtested
continuing play edited script stop main drive campaign little sandbox
way
could say little disappointed
thank reading made far
malenia blade miquellai malenia blade miqi malenia bladei malenia mai maidenless honestly game rather disappointing seeing people praise much make worried devs get complacent little given might see review think upset server issue game definitely fine launch
would right regard main good thing first
look beautiful
probably never better time turn tyranids traitor mist dust also latter case
story short sweet
wo change life fun
customisation main
crazy lack unit variety
specie like tyranids would think diversity monster trying kill time hormagaunts termagant tyranid warrior everything else stronger enemy carnifex neurothrope appear aside specific mission encounter
hell even gargoyle attack environmental thing story stop never attack
chaos little better
weak chaos cultist killed sprinting lol tzaangors small bird demon sword shield chaos space marine terminator lesser issue made worse secondary
lack operation
stand six operation enjoy class customisation
frankly get old quickly
mostly due operation story related mission opposed something like helldivers go invaded planet randomly generated environment side objective effect replaying story mission
also worse preference faction fighting effect three half tyranid operation two half chaos two thing together game feel like nothing
roadmap got feeling optimistic
year get enemy next year based wording two
wo even horde mode late next year
mission end year one next year
killing three thing per faction time insanely boring even tyranid warrior chaos space marine slight variation far similar feel fighting thing basic formula encounter dealing hormagaunts stabbing termagant shooting one tyranid warrior shooting stabbing basically tyranid experience however long want play issue throw
feel like space marine constantly taking crap load damage slow sluggish
higher difficulty make melee class three almost strictly one middle feel awful
execution feel like get old quickly feel like something desperately get armour back buy second rather look cool
feel like fighting horde give image three space marine making last stand tyranids yeah hardly
maybe top divided three people waiting kill one taking fair turn
gun accurate especially space marine people atrocious aim
sorry wait hype shockingly lacking
really thought would new addiction month really wo
remember everyone said kill helldivers might honestly helldivers sadly blow water currently stand opposite hoping
really hope try make better reckon little done add content glazing game game painfully starved content please play rogue trader dow darktide instead someone care game short ride someone often busy play enough little amount content felt know getting lot positive attention bought hype frankly even remotely worth state would happy wait another year get experience
keep low move fastkill first die lastone shotone killno luckpure remove giant offline mode text screen playing campaign please
absolute masterpiece game
game full detail exploring mythos journey west subtle reference buddhism taosim although maybe hard studied topic
bos unique way different mechanic however quite challenging
graphic best ever seen hopefully win game year
begining great got open area stutter unplayable
ca recommend game especially depends fast input boss bad time
imagine telling people cant state opinionsl developer full idiot commit horrendous atrocity emperor
love game franchise since rome ever since october update frequent crash rime reason happening ill get time texture water become black void mess rest map texture people bottom left also missing texture part super green like green screen
attempted fix thinking end checked file luck deleted game downloaded game time time problem till fix cant even play game min
pro forgiving yet challenging game fun gameplay story based buddist pilgrim year agocons invisible wall filesize fight king game mechanic explained well due language translation
devs actually reacted pushback soc cooked good dlc
keep game become even better second game emperor fallen leaf tell story
tarnished became elden lord
game made feel like kid
could wait get home work dive land
brilliant magical journey
thank software
reject modernity embrace monke played much game kinda slap ignore noise community great game liked tw warhammer great culmination campaign grand campaign map excellent
quantity dlc daunting picked cheapily online sale pick choose faction interested go baby step ca recommend play c mm offical server anymore
played regulary since time ac doesnt work anyway ranking system
alone ruin game
last cheater deteceted half year ago
since played match found linked account banned faceit
maybe faceit fun experience make worse decide solo queue mate toxic russian sus new account even high trust factor
even shinny many improvement compared csgo dont fix ac wont good experience either
fun part guess spend money case get nothing return besides crippling gambling addiction
tldr want depression play solo queue mmedit still problem like csgo game even worse complaint lack mimic protagonist whilst literally everyone else expressivestill great game though hoping story driven game
far bos battle bos battle
grind grind
fond
definitely beautiful game
graphic amazing
like like story immersive game
moment time would really really like able recommend game
enjoy mechanic especially new one added rendition adore warhammer universe loved every previous instalment series
however current performance issue title simply unable total war game game grown playing playing many many year hell still got original cd copy rome empire medieval ii etc
believe among greatest game made
however launched would least function playable standard pc good range function considered time
however
optimisation game horrendous know poor engine dated running code possibly likely denuvo
tried fix tweaked setting see changing considerable time come fixed performance balanced game mechanic different faction change review
time recommend pick game pick older game play death amazing
one definitely missed mark least personal expectation

elden ring
game restored faith video game industry
polished complete original ambitious
superior anything released recent played many game year life thought nothing could fix endorphin overdose game
game held hostage chair like game little kid every inch walk surprise challenge overcome
tf going beat
think end elden ring like life however simple thou tarnished scream like barbarian hoarah loux fight like malenia endure like radahn love like loved horse leonard think like miquella give like rykard graft way power like godrick seize throne like morgott try impossible like mohg die like godwyn

thank elden ring
edit look like right
exactly imagined
campaign fun multiplayer good enough yet
hoping second coming eternal crusade
please fix
try fingersbut hole hacker every game valve doesnt care game terrible state almost everyone cheat installed start cheating lose
rage inducing yet addictive unhappy warhammer iii
pale comparison warhammer ii
continue play hope continue get massive ai change
immortal empire campaign one main reason play still new race faction landmark
ai feel completely outmatched turn even legendary
need ai massive cheat bonus game need ai able confederate territory far often
also diplomacy warhammer one utilized
ca need seriously take look game handling interaction grand strategy campaign turn based game
faction economy whatsoever make far challenging irritating
want play khorne kislev get beat another race cause actually afford military power
confederation feel harder ever longer able buy ally like could way saying immersive fun
certain point relation ally strength rank seems silly province dark elf faction would confederate
diplomacy whole missing many additional option
barely even vassalize game perform certain diplomacy option even though available almost always unobtainable therefore lot battle change devs made better buffing melee infantry buffing melee cavalry magic target single target absolute waste wind
however minor settlement battle little irritable thankfully recently nerfed tower
removed walling minor settlement make entire defensive tab irrelevant
also lot building chain general multiple race feel like almost nothing far niche even bother
map incomplete still feel small
end game trilogy
even though greatly increased map almost need keep pushing border breaking land already
need walk turn every time get new town city
many area warhammer lore missing feel like easy opportunity lost u
druchii northern mountain dwarven chasm world edge conglomeration karak drazh karak eight peak also wth happened even remotely look like empire feel going greatly expanded new update bretonnia norscan peninsula kislev southern realm lustria araby much room development map change could make little town feel like whole new faction
eveything feel far condensed
warhammer ii always felt right pace ai could actually form empire actual global threat bunch squabbling major race ca manage territory
also defeated legendary lord apart game silly still happened
would allow race actually begin steamroll need lack endgame big bad even ultimate crisis mode max really kill unless super early
feel game potential great however right find disinterested salty truly failed dlc launch soc
dlc pushing back content release date almost month behind schedule
see another dlc even close less fully released soc leaving review
hope get change mentality better future
wtf dlc price holding patch update dlc made friend want play talisman cause least know getting talisman game sucky state ca need better communication
buy blood patch game still suck
survival battle dumb
buy bigger patch chaos dwarf dlc much better
took actually playable adjusts glass fun
huh since total war release fun
true ending absolute cinema ending also path get
beautiful every single way way implemented adaption journey west graphic cutscenes animation
wooohooo best shooter game avec le temp ce jeu est redevenu bon life honor fate duty fear fear reward salvation craft craft pledge pledge eternal service
monke leave cat everybody pass pet
フ l ヽ ﾉ excellent game warmed genre
exploration open world satisfying combat challenging fair
hour say understanding story dampen enjoyment game
monke я помню как valve объявила о начале данного продукта
тогда все хотели заполучить злополучную каэску увидеть и почувствовать на себе все изменения которых не мало
некоторые платили весьма кругленькие суммы неделями сидел на steam gift и все для того чтобы получить игру на которую возложено много надежд и множество ожиданий
однако все это было уже после того как valve сделала анкету пройдя которую можно было получить игру но мне было не понятно да и сейчас тоже непонятно по каким критериям выбирают сам я игру получил через месяца после прохождения анкеты
и те кто всё же получал c go поначалу были очень довольны
так же нельзя не упомянуть тот факт что разрабатывали игру две компании всем известная valve и менее известная hidden path и их новая counter strike go обещали порадовать всех и фанатов c и тех кто остался верен c и даже тех кто к контре так и не приобщился
многих порадовало то что в разработке принимала участие студия barking dog studio в своё время работавшая над c они заинтересовали тех кто мало знаком или незнаком вообще с онлайн шутерами
мнения остальных довольно контрастны
на мой взгляд перед нами всё та же counter strike source как известно c go использует именно движок source точнее последнюю его версию только с измененной графикой измененным видом меню и с чутка подкрученной баллистикой
и весьма сложно назвать возрождением counter strike поскольку в c go проглядываются черты не только counter strike но и черты call duty что было замечено еще в первом тейлере даже музыка в игре сильно напоминает музыку из modern warfare говоря о первом трейлере можно упомянуть что многим не понравилось как выглядят некоторые оружия особенно гранаты но уже на данный момент некоторые модельки потерпели изменения в лучшую по моему мнению все же игра доставляет удовольствие и не графики или изменённых карт которые действительно впечатляют а именно геймплея
геймплей в свою очередь почти не подвергся изменениям
он остался динамичным и воистину каэсовским эдакая смесь c и c
все также перед нами стоит выбор за кого играть за террористов или за общем и целом можно сказать что на данной стадии counter strike global offensive выглядит довольно прилично конечно есть недочеты но все же не стоит забывать что перед нами только beta версия и все еще может так же отметить несколько плюсов расширенный арсенал оружия улучшенная детализация оружия возможность при смерти играть за бота на серверах для баланса добавляются боты
огромным плюсом на мой взгляд стало то что оружие теперь имеет вес
с ножом бегаешь быстрее чем с винтовкой
так же появилась поддержка directx минусы я думаю будет глупо писать ибо это только beta версия и все еще может измениться
ever come across someone anime profile picture underestimate probably end top leaderboard unless
many hundred hour tww ii love series
tww launched buggy unplayable state assumed would eventually patch reasonable gaming experience
game unplayable release
launch content creator hyped reckoned game would fixed enough play
""
game version ca anymore
less two year since release version four point oh
game still great place officially giving hope ever
maybe version eventually drop game tww ii tapping
never fun playable state find demon gross
say lot interested watching match youtube actually playing tww iii fun
quality product recommend anything else time
""
like heart iron actually fun price hike dev company
game hacker either team opposing team team
whatever want
wallhack spinning rapidfire
matter
valve anything anyway
mean free play game working anti cheat okay
understand
valve make little money per day
understand whole year functioning anticheat
recommend game
developer treat player horribly
well maybe c go give money back free
emperor know man every corner took made feel like watching insane cinematic graphic environment immersive
love open game mesmerized
quite possibly based game ever played year playing improve skill learned new language skill curse russian brazilian tolerance level guttural scream loud sound bear cry child longer make feel better singing sweet traditional song culture очи чёрные dark eye garota de ipanema girl ipanema conclusion counter strike transformed better father better person addition making patient tolerant hateful people trained language psychiatric therapy
probably best shooter find
monke game good major issue server save file also stuttering waste time
monkey game came bit surprise since first instalment series moderately successful title left fan wanting
entire year later get sequel turbo boost concept original every way still play titus squad follows every mission main enemy first half game tyranids best dynamic swarm movement ever seen videogame thanks dev experience similar mechanic game like world war break cluster pile top wall generally act like real horde bot game truly impressive perhaps one best ever seen
never tire looking vast grandiose city going flame battle rage distance swarm alien descending sky battleship fire
design marine map also warhammer fan included rejoice small detail every character building model
course heavy graphical fidelity come price performance game need beast pc run ti could manage fps everything maxed dip extremely messy scene
still dlss job sure without performance would even worse game crashed hour play design also good special mention going weapon effect one describe main point gameplay limited enjoyable
mean wo get complex plot open map huge skill tree story mode almost completely linear point point b kill enemy cutscene repeat
loadout option overall really worth playing fun overstay welcome average duration hour side mission excluded melee combat click much personally awkward parry system combo performed one button
ranged shooting satisfying done story two main mode discover side mission heavily class progression system pvp mission much challenging main story require use combined ability weapon succeed offering weapon leveling special ability small skill tree marine customization pvp serviceable offering usual mode one would expect capture point team death match etc
including modified version skill tree used mode
run much better fps feel alright exactly afterthought certainly mode devs put work
example could added extra feature like vehicle turret ability unique faction even ability control tyranids ala left dead make criticism throw game simply wish mission weapon class definitely faction
happily devs promised exactly roadmap get update along way free paid cosmetic option likely expansion future ending main story hint commercial success title sure get emperor
regrettably leaving negative review pointing serious shortcoming space marine veteran player love first launch game epic game online component installed automatically without prompt screen
want computer
go loop uninstall
reason using steam steam want developer respect
compared darktide dawn war series especially mechanicus space marine weakest music ost
look like even top ten priority list cheap attempt game trying draw attention twitch terrible companion ai
one worst seen year
use ranged weapon case run gret distance melee enemy regarless class
rarely execute stunned elite enemy two foot away
shame
fov holding button activate ability instead hitting terrible design throwing frag grenade take two second activating cloak take another second
character get hit uncancellable animation
every movement ability use feel unresponsive stiff campaign multiplayer
runningg get interrupted reason even holding shift even hit anything
uncancellable dodge roll similar animation primary reason keep dying
control feel bos fight almost identical
area attack form round mortar shot melee charge attack ranged attack one big either green purple wide area attack hit even behind cover rinse repeat mechanic tyranid chaos boss
melee combat terribly designed
interruption common cost player half health ranged weapon feel weak
elite enemy bos lecter take bolter round put
crossing bone sword make enemy immune ranged damage even hit leg head spray side
enemy mentioned bullet sponge hit take half hp
crowd control option limited grenade
suggest developer play vermintide dark tide see perfected many year
hideous terrible jetpack mission
hated multiple resource loading logic screen
entire multiplayer lobby system redesigned
inject ally stimpack inventory
pvp section game worst
unbalanced
game cheater already
already witnessed speedhacks easy anticheat known bypass
bad choice number mission
mission general feel rushed unfinished exteremely repetitive little variation
even spawn location less unlocking armor piece better version weapon grindy
game target game becomes boring repetitive quickly
expect long lifespan
unable pickup medkits ammo box grenade even inventory slot available
pickup prompt ranged enemy shoot accuracy every shot land perfectly
shield armor mechanic recharges specific amount combo kill
mechanic working intended definitely user
wait discount buy cheapest package must
hype dead game longer played u
believe space marine would great game released year ago
game big awesome set piece aesthetic old school god war game core gameplay albeit tad forgiving really sick fast paced sekiro bloodborne combat every cool kung fu thing think ever mixed short bit may goty
also look fantastic run surprisingly well ti getting fps rt everything high strong recommend gate
stop playing go bed want played bit lunch still enjoying
first bos time overall easier fromsoft game
also really enjoying quick spell form change seems add nice diversity combat strategy
love game
enough time warhammer earned phd responsible adult
instead enjoy watching treemen slap piss chaos break heart say recommend game
creative assembly need custodian team iron bug
immortal empire campaign continues expand complexity interaction dlc introducing bug weighing game
problem lack dedicated team iron bug patch game ca baby
give development resource deserves
let child continue review dlc slowed ca seems putting time fixing game
problem still remain game starting feel healthy
good fps game bad many many cheater
""

consensus similar view warhammer bug unrefined mechanic lackluster game play allow continuous fun game offer
currently still worse version warhammer reason currently return occasional multiplayer campaigni expect ca pour soul game longer get feeling rather play warhammer wo recommend expect ca change thou warhammer realm chaos campaign suck joke rather play wraith sparta campaign update warhammer campaign eye vortex ill forgive seem like ca putting effort game enjoying
made immortal empire campaign free redid bad dlc putting update game putting vitality base content fixing bug yet somehow siege still awful like least revert
say game good
best russian military simulator really get drawn atmosphere ally scream cyka blyad pideras extensive session c go really feel like half russian
fomo game

decided get game buy
steam friend gave game gift blue thanks much appreciated
frank expecting game regular soul like chinese theme ok combat
well wrong
blown away one introduction story chapter cut scene topnotch developer hired participant short story award winner make
music give goose bump never listen sound track culturally chinese yet grand epic
ethnic chinese never played game authentically chinese whether aesthetic music
building clothing character
really compare game art design wo long wukong
though us chinese culture setting game
wo long look little chinese
like ninja turtle japanese level design game different regular linear arpg
combat good
despite using mainly staff mc weapon three stance player switch
stance strength weakness depending enemy fighting
encouraged switch stance different boss make fight better
spell spirit aka yao guai help customize build based fighting style
combat great
take note boss may easy soul veteran many others especially hidden secret boss give soul like veteran run money
map chapter surprisingly huge
given chapter one shorter
everything really huge starting chapter really great game
game get game award
game award rigged sure
black myth wukong started fun degraded throwing bos hour end spending said hour farming area try level
scenario frustrating dull
people keep comparing elden ring least elden ring could screw something else stuck
linear nature game force ram head wall wall break fun grind
game full cheater nothing done year begun work better
valve cut money skin chest company absolutely care community
rough attitude
recommend game already fan fromsoft soul game

fromsoft game mean direction little tell go go
game direction previous game due open world direction direct line necessarily take
game big direction map eventual destination immediate goal

roommate identical spec
get frame rate drop roommate
far tell way know issue get issue
people upset
able play game valid reason upset
conclusion never played soul game see get one dark soul game sale try first
already like soul game bother buying wont like
buy racing game like fine
okay like fromsoft arpgs let anyone tell differently
game disappointing creative assembly fallen far used drm horrible community interaction bug ridden since launch wildly overpriced dlc
wait mortal empire besides lack content change time lack luster melee pvp little customization freedom heretic legion despite overall game good really fun every year rise price big change people keep throwing money continue greedy hour august review change thumb constantly trying fix stuff
review game game fun really make easiest thing difficult
putting hour
july human potential great game
currently plagued numerous issue need urgent galore patch initially game seemed promising riddled bug
bug range minor inconvenience issue severely impact overall housing territory movement game significant feature missing ability access housing move territory
week since issue surfaced communication update developer leaving player issue game suffers persistent lag issue
whether peak time hour performance consistently hindered lag making gameplay frustrating often problem server always full yet feel dead
paradox frustrating either lack player dispersed way make game world feel empty
additionally fixing one server issue often lead another creating cycle reward system reward system overly complicated requiring multiple click claim reward
navigating four menu claim single reward repeating process others unnecessarily clear instruction game lack clear description instruction player particularly complex feature like prime war
understanding prime war tied one specific world within server crucial yet information poorly housing mechanic housing mechanic especially snapping horrid
building roof house wall struggle snapping feature barely work intended making construction frustrating system requires rework gear available wish machine
currency locked behind weekly task limited availabilitywhile game fun
definitely need polishing 𝑨𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝑾𝒂𝒓 𝑾𝒂𝒓𝒉𝒂𝒎𝒎𝒆𝒓 𝒆𝒏𝒋𝒐𝒚𝒆𝒓 good game take hour get level finally get level enters comp like badass realizes opponent team smurfs loses game tryhard next game ranked dmg play friend gold nova loses deranks gold nova get banned week joining fast enough game would buy
without dark light purposewithout lie truth purposewithout war victory purposewithout death sacrifice purposewithout hope future purposewithout loyalty one chapter purposewithout emperor nothing would purpose game cool ca management war community hate xenoshate hereticshate daemonslove brotherslove chapterlove emperorsimple love game patch nerfed fun part
clarify skilled hand played many game genre reached second chapter
review based current
gameplay traditional action rpg game basically meet expectation type experience resource combat improve ability face challenging difficulty
skill seem plentiful may balance issue since game much
graphic impressive
even without ray tracing dlss overall visual beauty stunning especially realistic depiction chinese landscape
atmosphere opening battle heavenly court swirling mist also exceptionally well
music exceeded expectation
whether music showcased trailer qin opera opening second chapter heard music demonstrates strong compositional lyric score align imagination game content
game primarily focus music truly surpassed dodge mechanism dodge timing seems overly strict perhaps inability interrupt attack dodge make game feel difficult black myth wukong particularly stand gameplay excels area turning game piece art appreciated angle
overall quality truly remarkable
game blow mind

dow 시리즈 이후로 이렇게 즐긴 게임은 처음인 거 같아요
bit difficult figure manage health armor still hard working switching weapon
체력과 아머 관리를 어떻게 해야 하는지 감을 못잡았을 때도 어려웠고 아직도 무기들 스위칭은 감을 모잡아서 어렵지만요
even take stress account still fun game play
그래도 저런 스트레스 요소들을 감안해도 여전히 재밌네요
downside take forever load game
거슬리는 부분은 게임 로딩이 너무 오래 걸리는 부분이네요
single player wait
싱글게임이면 그냥 기다리면 되겠습니다만
eternal loading time also take place multiplayer make literally eternal fight
멀티플레이 때도 영원한 로딩이 걸리는데 이거 때문에 문자 그대로 영원한 투쟁을 하게 되더군요
time loading done next round begin ca get back battle barge next round selecting class
로딩이 끝나면 다음판이 시작되서 배틀바지로 돌아가지도 못하고 다음 클래스 고르고 있네요
way manage eternal loading think game average game recommendation warhammer fan
영원한 로딩만 해결한다면 평작 이상은 한다고 생각하고 워해머 팬이라면 추천할만합니다
ridiculous dlc price increase update regular basis bug fix
literally favorite game mashed together one glorious product hour say totally worth
yes performance issue campaign specially mid game end turn game actually freeze bit specific faction turn battle fps turn totally fine similar previous title
always sure ca patch many new awesome mechanic bring really good breeze fresh air game fan series even think twice

brother missing leg casual conversation ultra would decapitate tyranids claw time majority negative review coordinate friend server going play mad world cant play together start new server lose typical tos misunderstanding cyber security expert wannabe flail around recklessly without actually understanding tos mean
tldr game backed gdpr guideline breaking would sold queue time server

german die maus steuerung ist au der hölle
e werden auch joypad tasten angezeigt wenn man kein joypad angeschlossen hat
im menü funktioniert keine taste da mus man rechte maustaste drücken und dann ein joypad befehl auswählen
mag sein da dy bei fromsoftware normal ist kann ich nicht beurteilen ist mein erstes fromsoftware spiel aber wer mich al pc spieler nicht respektiert der verdient auch mein geld nicht
ich kann au medizinischen gründen nicht mit joypad spielen
vielleicht mal einem sale
game sieht sonst gut au und läuft zumindest bei mir auch flüssig

art style could simply graphic consider art style everything put right place give beautiful view world every place given time
moment stop look direction see look like beautiful painting front almost always different thanks day night cycle weather change
pretty cryptic obscure difficult understand first intricate storytelling direct fact get little information npc cutscenes mostly need read item description basically let world speak connect piece left anyway lot lore speculation
game progress open world setting give lot freedom progress game almost nothing directly given beside general tip go understand
stressful much gameplay getting used make appreciate sense bewilderment give encourages exploration always important
side quest progress inserted paragraph separately eventually ed finishing game probabily miss lot content side quest obscurity everything else missable even much criticism game still encourages replayability order understand experience everything probably need different run anyway
variety world massive varied divided different region unique atmosphere fitting enemy look story
many dungeon major one beautiful minor one feel repetitive point enjoyed anyway sort gimmick give bit variety
lot enemy encountered boss regular enemy later game feel repetitive give impression sort filler fitting game massive matter anyway
finally ton ingredient item equipment dozen type weapon different movesets style
even without replayability part game immense take easily hour finish without even experiencing everything good replayability start new keeping progress first run experience content missed still trying new thing like different build approach also different ending requires partake different side said best game ever played almost hour still enjoy creating new character playing different way even discover new dungeon item time
masterpiece
nobody read review say gay game solid personally otherwise would finished time done achievement
anything game enjoyed
graphic story combat chinese setting everything clicked real fun every singular minute spent game
thing game could improved letting player enjoy equipment earlier game fact enough resource upgrade everything want single playthrough little bit frustrating
get many cool thing late game simply enough time playing
guess chapter planned could implement everything mind
playing game hour undawn lifeafter look like garbage game first get threatening started adventure love series ever since supported buying every dlc release
latest one simply look boring uninspired top ca threatens pull support game dlc sell
least reasonably priced deliver ca simply worth ca kill game wonder money maker going definetly going pharoah
make dlc people buy sing praise
release shadow change quality dlc get got overwhelmingly negative recent rewievs going back mixed rewievs overall
great game killing ca community
pricing model criminal
right discus entitlement earn playing game assembly first time playing game franchise universe dark beautiful deeply engrossing
graphic top notch fantastic
feel fairly smooth play sort like gear war god war baby
downfall lack content full priced game
hoping add content specifically operation soon
game really fun definitely recommend anyone fan franchise curious
review mixed issue seems come people saying game constantly stuttering issue
noticed issue sort possible lower graphic setting would likely help issue
game pop strange shadow make feel game lacking slight polish however believe much issue kind stuff expected large feel like game fun effective keeping one attention may issue keeping player engrossed enjoy running beaten path many encounter difficult either encourage player come back later nudge right direction
one situation opened chest transported poisonous swamp seemingly way fast travel always option long danger realize enduring large amount stress many enemy one encounter difficult foot horseback approach may help easily defeat said make sure use material potential crafting extremely helpful taking strong foe
thank agree point consider purchasing game due point please leave helpful rating
extremely hardcore shooter force think differently modern shooter
call duty player going need change play style succeed offensive definitely sequel look feel familiar minor tweak help balance old issue surprise longtime player
demanding multiplayer game satisfying ever specific kind player
willing learn play different used look elsewhere
otherwise tactic game probably share legacy predecessor epic journey never still making way game playing chapter clear game something game reminds lot sekiro environment absence traditional stats leveling system way increase core attribute mana health
also brings mind nioh ability equip spirit gameplay blend combo stance storyline captivating brought life cartoonish cutscenes brimming personality
based journey west game polish evident throughout
gui beautifully designed sound effect hit right soundtrack play character stay true storyline ancient chinese novel
armor weapon obtained crafting resource currency collect along way
flask customized item give temporary advantage like increased defense healing time
mechanic gameplay black myth wukong rely traditional stats like endurance strength agility
offer system
unlock enhance skill switching stance explore different playstyles
respeccing quick painless letting experiment without needing annoying item always action ready try something die
seriously actually enjoys feature
glad left game invisible map wall navigation bit confusing time biggest issue game game kick strong great enemy variety stunning map slew unique boss
difficulty feel fair cheap like elden equip trinket stick weapon modify upgrade
weapon take away need pc run game smoothly especially crank setting
could use optimization surprised denuvo causing performance aesthetic voice acting point interesting mechanic like transforming insect bird fox add nice layer variety
verdict overall black myth wukong fantastic achievement
got excited see studio next
game deserves success giving solid
ca praise sun owned game first going write review
however recently joined awesome community server kind though incorporate experience people think game counter strike global offensive think player experience
strictly multiplayer game people often refer certain toxicity general player base c would like shout server
server server played awesome
multiple occasion opened familial past son kurt light life
often get shot hater troll like server received much love
honestly honestly heart warming gotten point familiar face server renounce join lobby even asking son kurt school previous day
also disposed fact wife split half year happy marriage friend server nothing supportive
typical session usually go talking son kurt owl backyard world war ii documentary loving time
one recent feat server making generally healthy kinder place
made point say gg every round point evil player shout obscenity saying say gg every round never get
getting pretty lengthy like leave high note
want shout server however remember name
fact find certain one writing please reach say hello often son kurt room say hi well
found new love shooting genre computer game plan sharing many many moment friend one meet way
thank valve making possible
still enjoyable csgo full player unbelievable skill crazy spin crack shot
feel like neo movie matrix
goty monke hell nah goty
""
ridiculous price hike like сould recommend game new player ca somehow became worse paradox term dlc pricing
example country regional price shadow change dlc cost less baldur gate
new dlc lack content even comparison dlcs chaos dwarf one opinion also overpriced
even get started lack flc content got lh since year realise
owerall state game awfull
game tonn bug line sight issue still fixed faction like vampire coast literally unplayable moment
even know game work maximum lvl hero hero skill even one introduced end notice spare skill point ca spent
example lot bug witch ruin sure hope new dlc least half amount content ca
""
like story pretty much itpve mixed
class fun busted really make hard play class think damn vanguard suck could play tactical offer much utility damage team simply existing could play sniper laser anything even dare exist
vanguard perk work nearly dead boltguns peashooters like every bolter ingame starting six pve map crazy choice modern age many different game much better pve option opposed space marine especally randomly generated map
exist within considering large universe melee combat done pretty poorly game larger enemy stand nothing hit weapon hardly move away move break attack chain leading spamming one button mob something gun game underpowered stuff like melta la fusil everything underpreforms inbetween two idea weapon fall somewhere scale inbetween horde clear single target damage
many bolters plain make sensethe enemy unfun fight beacause tactic accept rush attack shoot
tyranid warrior weaker numerous rushed alongside guants maybe attack right happens near tail end tyranids lictor ravenor nurothropes
could show attack least expecting really make feel like hivemind trying force opening team defensethen thousand son could unortodox tactic relying drawing space marine killzones rocket launcher sniper setup eat chaos spacemarines lock melee combat overall really wan na try would give two hour really dislike get refund
dont get wrong game fun brain easy
game combine rust dayz also day die epic game beat valve company could work year perfecting one product completely remove replace po created month lag compensation sleeping top server goodluck playing get abused peekers advantage game crash constantly running accuracy feel different playing cod need stand still shot anymore run gun ar game still hit every shot anyways anyone thinking game worth wrong
anyone enjoying ask valve really updated
thing rest community see better graphic add campaign mode next story line play single player apparently valve know f ck competitive shooter unfinished mue steaua great see game like made
bought friend addicted tl dr game designed take money hidden beautiful good human pretty graphic oustanding atmosphere missing lot game
character creator presets allow lot freedom even body
something missed game either slim slightly thicker
story interesting almost compelling continue
cinematics music pretty look listen bad hour played many moment oh like game
usually compliment case took inspiration game implemented way let change thing straight
said atmosphere beautiful otherworld call knowing name bit confusing tbf could control
far felt awful deja vu prey death stranding nier control heavy emphasis control death stranding
good played handful survival game one far worst hud menu crafting system game designed make money microtransactions called micro considering spent skin
make sense otherwise would free
opinion survival openworld wrong genre make money
first look store greeted ton timed event thing happening many thing unlock money first noted season pas crime survival open world hud thing large way important hud symbol like thirst hunger odd place small
crafting menu reminds fortnite tbh
also crafting queue timer long thing wan na craft going take
even though friend chose server world still landed different one
biggie teleportation tower brought u together fast
feel bad say
absolutely facial expression move clunky way mouse sensitivity highest setting somehow still slow drag mouse across whole mousepad
dialogue option tutorial intro see tried choosing different question mc ask instead giving mc voice let u weird motion speaking face move inch
either opted full voicing like mass effect none go straight dialogue like baldur gate similar game presented dialogue interest story artstyle almost enough convince force
others may find entertaining play really hope people game beautiful trying many unimportant even wrong thing given much attention
sadly human stay game looked forward long punched face
watch afar story progress unfold ca force continue
seriousness ca recommend game state like even free
need allow queue people eternal war blessed mind small noticed lot people performance issue take away running game high setting dlss ca really remember frame dip stuttering texture loaded fine
encounter maybe instance minor graphic glitch campaign distract experience meaningful way speaks running hardest difficulty solo complain get as beat
war hammer fan time since og space marine felt immersed setting
wait year fix content dire need first even get cheaper positive note great potential see ever get game
emperor
genuinely love game right recommend buying base game dlc ca continues improve game continue edit recommend change released
great campaign multiplayer cross probably least like one
definitely recommend getting acquainted first game may seem superficial rather ordinary usual boring gameplay starting chapter reveals strength interesting explore many secret combat system develops simply crazy mixture everything imagine simply colossal assortment various boss elden ring compete rating journalist really play maximum able get chapter draw conclusion think game deserves huge game made developer year really deserves respect

great visuals challenging emperor
holding last little bit goodwill ca besides shogun first two total war warhammer game best total war series played
immortal empire still beta nice ton choice play one friend
bad thing game realm chaos campaign mechanic annoying even though faction fun play
another plus active multiplayer community host tournament overall one accepting helpful community seen gaming
recent update bug fix feel like ca right direction making game great
crush blaidd one know review lost pile review
life honor fate duty fear fear reward salvation craft craft pledge pledge eternal service
monkey got crazy as move honestly fantastic game
campaign though short fun made length operation mode
multiplayer fun great build diversity allowing fresh experience every time play
visuals great mode honestly best seen complaint wish cosmetic chaos multiplayer vanguard need nerf multiplayer lol
also melee combat feel little sometimes pve pvp game breaking issue
besides game great highly recommend anyone looking game interesting story fun pvp buy game
c go good game need new anticheat
game opinion fantastic regret buying severe flaw community defends great writing review forgive worldopen worldran flawlessly system though saying muchweapon selectionmultiple combat stylesgreat charactersbeautiful scenery graphical modelssense progressionmultiple endingsconsendings basically short underwhelming hour inventory system worst seen long time difficult compare item statistic
despite insistence weight major part mechanic seem able carry every weapon armour game person
actually realise heavy weight severely limiting dodge mechanic hour point game became significantly found consumables game generally useless
ended using small lantern dark area health potion
item hoarded without feeling need use listed weapon armour selection pro found really use
starter armor vanguard early game sword carried entire game
difference armour seemed mostly really feel opportunity play style combat due heavily investing current style gameplay
yes get option respec later game point comfortable want suddenly change spell caster melee combat despite ridiculous amount spell journal list completed objective
people ca glued game day day excuse missing ui element especially due poor quest line progression hand holding guidance npc questlines despite people say forum
accidentally find npc random location get perhaps hint quest line lucky encounter next part quest realise part quest
quest may completed scenario discovered game time may even forgotten interaction npc start inadvertently lock certain quest progression miss completely lack guidance break quest fail instantly
give one example may slight spoiler demonstrates point well
non human npc wish become human npc attains goal chance upon npc try interact get three dot rest site next npc dead
looked online turn get random item specific set circumstance must activate next npc prevent
completely random guidance
also another major npc start game miss way find perform game emote first obtain certain fact almost completely missed major section game
haligtree separate area optional get area must use medallion certain location also used another medallion progress main questline
obvious must use switch medallion get optional area
even think missed haligtree medallion complete point location became useless discover next bonfire
discovered approached last bos game confused encountering certain boss
game require look questlines online even community defends saying observant keep notepad write thing ridiculous start game incredibly difficult mind actually enjoy start levelling getting used common enemy animation game becomes progressively easier point tedium exception boss compensated much larger health pool difficult dodge aoe really dabble much pvp
tried couple time forced single player content ended almost shot everytime sure going
experience put exploring aspect game wish npc could enjoy consistently interacting keeping company
couple npc liked interaction felt shallow
end game none npc really mattered exception maiden going specific ending
monke much like tww
product received free el juego esta buenisimo literalmente puedes hacer lo que quieras la historia esta buena tienes buenos graficos pero lamentablelmente esta muy mal optimizado respecto la taza de fps los servidores tambien se puede jugar pero podria ser mucho mejor en ese sentido
el chat de amigo tambien esta mal hecho cuenta un culo abrirlo
aparte de eso el juego e genial pego desde el primer momento cuesta entender un poco al principio por que tiene un monton de informacion pero con tiempo se entiende mejor
lo recomiendo totalmente find way buddha light found pleasure understand game devs ca understand every expect understand game
developer game understand people pay money worse lack understanding
would recommand buy game sale
realy enjoy game least consider buying war warhammer still full game price released nearly year ago total war warhammer ii still full game price released like year ago total war warhammer iii get idea combine campain map one big cluster f ck map
honest get real feeling total war also real feeling warhammer want special hero also need bought dlc
remember dlcs tw wh ii iii able put big immortal realm campaign
technichly best total war game huge impact hero fight campain way expansiv bought big steam sale

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa recent effort creative assembly regain goodwill fan absolutely paid
patch new content released shadow change expansion spectacular seems getting better throne decay indication
keep good work game tell purchase must agree let upload browser network data play
""
totally get game want track harmless analytics diagnostic data quality improvement server find bug patch game
game developer need browser network data though
principal alone kicked back refund
care future gaming
day refund great steam quit allowing developer insert unadvertised usage agreement purchase
neither honest valid might unfortunately one promising game last year wait something better
statement really say anyway
perhaps reason considered spending money apparently rebounding emotionally trying recover crushing disappointment deathloop
fun cool buy game game first shown public thought definitely getting canceled
second time showed thought another generic cash grab attempt
third time thought good true
got released intention checking amount hype news surrounding made buy game day release thinking bad refund
playing intro decided getting refunded matter recent year gaming landscape feel crowded sequel reboots remasters remake uninspired unoriginal crap close straight plagiarism potential success plagued issue terrible practice like microtransactions lootboxes live service model focus meeting marketing deadline instead delivering finished polished game etc
hard find something play recently loaded far cry could mindlessly shoot thing laugh friend bad game still managing fun modern game black myth wukong stand refreshing entry industry game hack slash combat punishes attempt button mash blending element souslike actual lore cinematic cutscenes accessible casual player presenting u story rooted chinese mythology seen large game unknown many westerner different usual hero villain grown used say advance game far perfect also unique way aside first aaa china
highly widely praised already among favorite game time deserving game year award
think excels almost every single aspect also one recent aaa game really feel polished finished launch
trying copy anything trying something unnecessary stuff make think even game
storytelling immersive amazing voice acting least english chinese
first look like classic journey growth redemption hero downfall soon realize told darker natural tone character flaw pointed frowned upon constantly opponent ally
typical hero heck even monkey king monkey might destined fulfill sun wukong path depending action game fail cycle continues another monkey able complete journey
end chapter get cutscene look like modern anime look like something studio ghibli claymation give nice touch graphic simply amazing one best looking game along alan wake senua saga hellblade ii
full ray tracing amazingly implemented upscaling technology
performance surprisingly stable optimized
reason missing proper hdr support making area burn retina excessive brightness area pitch dark
seen lot people complaining forced dof texture blended world
lack customizable option think dof game could perfect toned bit even texture place game since creates sense depth scene
easily recognize playable ground filling scenario differentiate important place place ca even reach everything amount detail world would overly sharp level design weak point opinion used fromsoftware game tough competition know compare similar game genre since usually play
world beautifully crafted ca explore much
mind invisible wall since open world game could definitely better placed
chapter pretty linear sometimes offered two different path path loop around lead place good sometimes pay much attention sometimes enhances atmosphere sometimes completely steal show like headless monk chapter yaksha king fight moment leading obtaining jingubang cave great sage broken shell fight etc
gameplay fluid challenging fair difficulty
combat dynamic fast paced still pay attention resource enemy action
lot unlockable skill three different staff instance serve different purpose spell require planning use waste mana cooldowns different equipment alter playstyle consumables give edge battle feel bos simply stronger
removing staff throw bad decision since left zero ranged game nice pace point felt tired bored stuck
narrative layered ensures stay invested throughout whole thing
familiar journey west aside monkey king character feel like consuming medium related
game ending find perfect
first one called bad ending default one player monkey character fight stone monkey great sage broken shell mindless spiritless body original sun wukong find accomplished success also failure golden headband fitted head taking broken shell place awaiting true destined monkey fulfills sun wukong destiny
second ending called true ending requires complete lot optional task fight erlang presented first scene game archnemesis result unveil truth intention sun wukong action
monkey recovers sun wukong memory end rejecting golden headband finally uniting six relic proving indeed destined one rising sun wukong monkey king leaving room expasion second game
black myth wukong somehow managed surpass expectation already extremely high set new benchmark future game genre
shoutout developer started passion project made first public showcase mean attracting people team instead trying sell unfinished dr reject buddhahood return monkey decision give free upgrade shadow change partial refund pharaoh push back release throne decay enough content polish close worth crazy price tag right decision ca
drama aside game pretty good btw malenia gyat emperor month wait include blood violence ip exists solely exude extreme blood violence
would like madden replaced tackling touch unacceptable
game incredible
absolute shame released unplayable online server

even getting anything win besides pointless rank score effected chance mvp winning actual kill death score based upon know good good
even getting eagle prior frankly caring anymore playing consecutively boring without proper team friend like back c league match

alphariusthis lie want frustrating experience entire life start playing c go get wrong ideea graphic good developer dose give flying community possible smaller company indie developer soo listen need player billion company ca give u care money oo tick rate server lot lag problem server updating sound time like month unreal happening exemple look esea taking month least playing tick rate server possible valve
lot question disappointed hate say community leaving story dota ca listen simple important need player play game pay invest loot money sad sorry long post sorry english nice night everyone someone played total war series introduced warhammer saddens see complete utter disarray going climactic never willingly written review intention bomb title oblivion quite often people x z occasion feel justified adding voice choir fan tired simply used ca bottom line feed short term monetary gain drip fed patch every several month tend break thing say listened back forth
content creator told repeatedly thing past community end liking ignore push anyway
trim dlc bare minimum increasing price excuse everything went price buy kill support game
good luck getting people purchase future tw title attitude
greedy business practises shareholder turned game industry money making racket developer extent consumer suffer greed
keep consumer happy bank account game flourish
many time lesson need repeated publisher studio
ambition want see tw series ca close shop
people employed trying make living
however good conscience recommend game dlc content current moment time due shady greedy outright laughably insulting business practises
edit previous review change positiveca great job latest dlc
tell actually buckled many common negative plagued game added value dlc
new pack came really fun
though wish part complimentary game purchase great job nonetheless
empire kind relevant kislev chance getting completely steamrolled hell even nurgle fun
also worked good v evil faction bad faction ally one another good faction align also
previously played say skaven weird spot one like good bad
longer case
good faction also feel relevant clearly tell stopped mixing carpet cleaner bleach office party
keep good work
waiting day could change review positive finally come
nice fps game try take alot skill though
opinion game rating reflect quality properly apart graphic music mythology
actual gameplay get tiring two four stunning graphic fluid gameplay nice style myth lot bos miniboss fight shorter area typical soul game unique bos fighting style boss either easy death medium death make continous progressnegative boring as combo system fighting small enemy area boss lame repetitive left entirely different timing similar move combo unnecessarily delayed move make first try harder still kill quite couple boss first try intuition guide accordingly example last bos graphic stuff variation mechanic design graphic excluded wukong combat love warhammer total war mostly open world battle
need every settlement siege type battle repetitive resulted almost battle making empire sim total war game
hope give u option soon cant play anymore back
update every month
empty promise game barely function
expensive dlc content buggy af game
game year playing hour still finished story
much explore game keep giving
blow mind find random dungeon unexpected place
rewatch intro trailer scene make sense happened seeing place game
best game played long time
ohhh elden ring great tho one people thats either going upgrade machine wait optimize
get peculiar pausing happening would normally feel like rubber banding lag actually paused everything general flow doesnt actually affect anything
get maddening sometimes going complex environment heap happning sweet hour time even simple environment go mate mine nothing even slightly go wrong
hence thought upgrading ryzen yr old cpu game beautiful full stuff movement beautiful flow get going
worth money
bought two copy one wokie wo make difference
product received free black myth wukong game think
opening strong gorgeous visuals incredible art direction mystifying enemy bos design
problem begin however introduction real game begin
black myth wukong dress rpg superficial
reality black myth wukong bos rush
little downtime bos fight often moving directly one fight another
something game offer linear level nothing way say game entirely without merit
visually game feast eye music sound design top quality
combat system visually pleasing mechanically deep array skill spell transformation item equipment player variety hampered totally linear progression armour weapon found game world unlocked shop arbitrary amount progress made
likewise spell skill unlocked specific point story
leaf game severely lacking player agency decision making go order progress story level game beautifully decorated corridor bos waiting end even within scant hour shallow loop becomes immediately apparent
bos rush nature game fall flat without framing behind
boss fantastic visual design framing within story little lore explanation behind enemy facing leave erratically jumping one quirky bos fight another feeling disconnect
without framing significance bos lost could grandiose fight becomes pedestrian affair bos becomes another box tick road end myth wukong spectacle sure feel like using spectacle crutch distract little depth gameplay feel like mechanic good rpg created forgot create world go
git gud git maiden think
buy trust even two day playing game cemented one favorite favorite game far
fire af loved warhammer part enjoy warhammer ambush work ai several situation ai avoid army ambush even without breaking ambush stace chaos dwarf grimgor kept dancing around mountain army blocking path ambush another blatant fay enchantress fast sailed towards settlement mine moved army hidden encampment next settlement returned settlement came army stayed hidden blatant ai see stupid 𝘎𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵 𝘨𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘳𝘶𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘣𝘺 𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘴

adding voice choir game look nice
campaign multiplayer add lot game time
severe problem part
hacking rampant pvp ive seen pve reason report button devs dont seem take seriously
unfortunate hurting game also balancing issue game
mechanic require locked animation happen like gunstrikes
problem cant move happens take second dont invisibility frame time
die often
also ranged enemy spam shoot without end enemy wall
armor weak dont lot health
right circumstance execute gunstrike locked animation bunch small range enemy shoot game
gunstrike also happen mistake sometime
punished using game mechanic dont know patched yet thing devs released fix spread core usage game using like core would bsod pc main menu think solid game apparent devs didnt test releasing creating small problem add bad experience sometimes
change review ever decide speak fix issue
instead frenzied flame called freaky flame instead burning erdtree ground incinerating divide sucked radagon toe
godrick like spess mehreens helldivers starship trooper extermination drg

nobody read review push ups every like get
jump amazing game great gunplay
ca walked back horrible stance minor amount emotional manipulation blame could good sign
game lot promise lot edge smooth changing rage tentative recc revisit full review couple content release show way wind negative ire total war favorite series said sega follows threat abandon support game already nowhere near finished substantial span time release never buy another total war product learned total war kingdom impact underbaked uninspired overpriced dlc term making ongoing profit ongoing development
instead got away abandoning title literally threatening
get act together
easy recommend dreamed since game would promise
much love effort put game
goty
elden ring soul like everyone learned hour
time realized one best game genre
good mechanic old software game importantly jump separate button thanks miyazaki
game good balance weapon class pve tested pvp
fact play like
game boss plus also include story boss diverse pretentious suitable style game
little say optional one many repeated boring erdtree avatar many stop enjoying game
game boss anyone ranging junk tibia mariner like ending malenia game abandoned lot without passing
world content world elden ring beautiful large mostly empty
run lot find kind dungeon loot bos going story kept game
love explore world game
new player genre passed month release elden ring pleased presence open world avid player series criticized developer something understand
term content game world lot wherever go find new cave new bos friendly npc elden ring spoiler part plot say one thing understand anything need read description object read dialogue line
general confused miyazaki love
worth least go game
result result want say developer done great job game recommend every gamer go regardless fact casual true hardcore
highlighted keywords bold skip read part concern
update option disable camera auto centering
huge deal dr pro art direction variety unique bos battle even regular mob
sheer amount content explorable area variety weapon item etc
challenging without feeling unfair time
variety viable build
everything game including character chest hair hidden lore behind dr con pc port extremely lacking
graphic option seem change performance much
feel like lazy port
mouse kb utilised fullest potential suspect match limitation controller
lead weird unintuitive control playing mouse kb
played slightly prefer camera need improvement
essential part quest
would near impossible figure certain side quest regular playthrough
pvp could improved dr conclusion flaw think still masterpiece
game need good cpu get playable fps
might intimidating first never played previous soul title like definitely rewarding experience
definitely recommend buying regret
new series try screw build early put point vigor wan na miserable specific pro con played controller fair amount time
since review pc version game think important talk implementation
much easier faster look around mouse controller look around avoid attack boss easier
however annoying auto centering ca disabled constantly fighting camera move
also ca use keyboard weird keybindings like g key map set default changed
also ca set key want item item wheel like would expect pc game
need use limited selection combination primary secondary item wheel really unintuitive playing kb mouse find hard set comfortable key configuration due weird limitation
settle weird keybindings end inevitably
also ca bind spell incantation specific key
suspect intentional design choice made match controller limitation
highly dislike limitation think justified artificially handicap playing certain platform using platform fullest potential instead
anything annoying deal expect changed
lot performance issue seem stem easy anti cheat pro art direction easily best part game
lot scenary look like straight painting
pretty much every build type seems viable except maybe bow crossbow
might adapt certain fight playing mage attack build everything viable
bos design also great none feel like throwaway bos design
speaking boss boss unique movesets learn dodge avoid etc
feel like unfair get hang game
many location explore including whole underground area cave catacomb dungeon many hidden find
disappointed amount content game sure
also people complaining game hard wanting easy mode abosultely easy mode game
spirit summons ai summons even multiplayer summons make game basically easy mode utilised properly
think unfair call game hard game give option choose difficulty wan na play
like certain gameplay mechanic system always workaround
personally think freedom choice game provides excellent
split music absolutely epic godskin apostle morgott radagon theme memorable past fight ambient music con probably worst part soul game
inexcusable many devs still figured make proper camera system
lot death due able see bos move bos performing
camera tracking poor locked slow turn around locked due auto centering
input queuing game fine part get stop people spamming button
get trying dodge enemy attack get caught due input queue game make dodge roll get hit recover lead getting hit follow attack lot time maybe even dying
understand punished punished already
creates lot frustration especially since dodge game happens button release already millisecond delay tried dodge roll initially
especially noticeable fast paced fight
lot side quest impossible without looking go
example one side quest requires find hidden stair different part map reveal hit order proceed
mention map game massive finding quest practically impossible regular playthrough
know design choice something would enjoy worth keeping mind
imo decent solution would optional journal feature like skyrim give hint way completely ignore look wan na get done quest play without looking external guide
looking buy game reason suggest looking co op work buy
quite limited straight forward expect
also invasion player try kill party
might pro con depending might looking
pvp passable
balanced thing ever anything flaw game great invalidate experience
think definitely worth full price
even new soul game like definitely enjoy game
definitely goty contender
said hope devs iron issue facing pc version
friend play elden ring said post review game get like award buy rtx kilo canned bean
gon na leave
help brother
run well u like war hammer brainer game content
lot
u main mission side mission
side mission lvls difficulty u play take time clear map enemy type change elite bos spawn
u upgrade ur character lot customization
game decent pvp
good game maybe goty
""
good true
part violence
wan na play sun wukong chance
finally moved point playable restored honour eye predecessor
immortal empire finished infinitely better chaos forge campaign
good outstanding bug crash performance bit clunky
ai darktide
testosterona potente spreadsheet simulator experience far hammer anvil unit wasting time since going break anyways even cycle even unit hold first two three rear charge
nothing ever rout ai content stand still worst position entire map defensive even better ground easily available
really impact game much though momentum impact effectiveness charge actually closed melee difference high ground minuscule
mention even gunpowder infantry line sight gentle suggestion
together mean instead asking make put unit game instead asks make unit matchup basic sword spear cav actually whole web interaction armor magic attack attack poison attack probably know yet
complex know actually much depth
maybe find later starting knowledge check instead intuitive mechanic like positioning ridiculous power lord hero significantly reduces value well commanded unit unit size mean fairly agnostic surrounded become ability got ta eat
spell also generally disruptive good tactic help facilitate
push everything blob crunched together
go artillery powerful enough ca ignore push towards engaging enemy soon possible meaning really allowed extended skirmish personal preference feel like ranged unit areeither outputing much damage sturdy
advantage ofthe majority unit able hit back alreadyenough incentive bring ranged think actually single core battle system actually like design
individual unit faction mechanic sure core system
hard believe developer first major around pretty great game well telegraphed enemy lot fun
game borrows quite bit typical formula manages distinguish enough offer unique experience
game also way heavier focus bos fight might expect
fact time would stretch call borderline sometimes face one bos right another barely minute
there also visuals
honestly sure even need said overall visual presentation unquestionably among best medium make sure turn god awful framegen
despite game somehow run pretty frustrating aspect game far invisible wall quite plentiful fairly disappointing considering thought kind thing left era huge issue
far there much else dislike good stuff easily worth full price tag
making immortal empire available owner total war warhammer iii great call
better time get game
short really think everyone clamoring dark soul
long button combat mostly world seems consumption feel often ugly washed many better system previous back better idea network need wiki leg go
monitor stop working
crashed mostly dark soul bigger extra tat tacked yet somehow whole thing feel bit cheap
big mostly empty open world dodgy traversal mechanic
hour played mostly hiding bush collecting flower
new sneaking around fun assassin creed way one camp found enemy tend line site one another backstab slow enough leave open
little saw really build character around stealth
long found gatehouse archer spot cover bos adjacent monster really let get away like aforementioned ubisoft sandbox
really game done favor comparing assassin creed often ugly game
asset pop creature disappear color feel washed
uncommon software game character creation screen looked like marked improvement
sadly game model low rez larger one hard corner show limited poly count
many asset seem copy pasted giving whole experience cheap feel
helped fact prolog slideshow
make wonder could causing lag
mind dyeing soul game lag keep killing gon na bit cross
odd pretty high end pc run much much better looking game ultra without issue
early supposed loose fight bugged badly thing faded black took damage
stayed way long enough thought crashed saw loading uncomfortably long time
alone would issue worth waiting patch buy control janky
seem analog sensitivity adjustment keep switching controller found one interrupt walking across room straight line
could happened nailed
yeah elephant room sekiro sekiro get
traversal stealth combat improvement mile soul game ditched reason
saying needed grappling hook make jump awkward imprecise
low ledge wall seem encourages jumping unclear vaulted
like sekiro embrace idea movement consume stamen sort
combat though somewhat academic due poor stealth system factor place
sekiro also nailed parrying blocking dodging
mean balanced enough useful
perilous attack system spectacular way engage foe
unlike soulsborn game really parry
yet reason part back dark soul style block dodge parry inexact better bothering
review keep saying culmination software learned seems like middling idea
even want pull sekiro combat ignore game
presence dark soul seems double weapon nice hardly game best feature
seem keep dark soul great time dark soul bloodborn greatly refined formula
yet dark soul seems contained none made game better
awash samey weapon though bb taught dozen well designed weapon better way way many sword
parrying especially needed look three title
made nigh everything parryable gave big window counter bb made parrying range possible sekiro made fluid enough always strong option
back parrying blocking dodging still viable
truth game proof failed learn even looking peer done
network test leveling strength gave ability wear heavier armor nioh game let mutable stats dictate switch back endurance granting carry weight
""
make sense strength based character heavier armor
strength scaling weapon often slower windup longer punishes result may soak hit land blow
good idea proven work game cut
note rallying system got
great feature seen crop many game
hidden somewhere overstuffed mess
could go played game five hour felt longer think really got anywhere
point fact think already gone long kind moot primary issue kinda boring
mean
never started new software game within hour reaching podcast
want sekiro bloodborn heck even take dark soul want whatever
update many hour get horse combat helped largely fun
everything come caveat
mounted section good get arbitrarily knocked alpaca
admittedly annoying worse nothing
barding equip beast game say putting point dexterity help keep falling dex see much difference
also would sort mater huge difference far tell actively anything increase fluffy friend hp
getting knocked horse often instant death lie ground age waiting mauled
unlike controller torn hand held reach ether killed obscenely low health
put cherry alpaca manure sunday fine beasty inevitably die use health potion revive way menu prompt asking sure want bring chance survival back dead megger cost one many easily replenished item
yeah pretty forking sure elden ring except bother died battling superfluous text box
keeping caveat boss often quite fun despite copy paste nature let
say learn pattern mater ever take break
dark soul got critisised many foe per encounter take half hyper combo
far best option find favorite utterly broken spell consumable ash war etc shortage use crutch game decides change ru huge improvement compared new gameplay mechanic campaign battlemap make huge recommendation
course early bug optimization issue full confidence ca address every single one game polished short order due ca record interaction communication fan
game current state still fun regardless current bug doubt putting hour
confidently recommend warhammer release immortal empire reduced many issue realm chaos campaign newly added faction lord significantly improved realm chaos experience
said still unfortunate base game faction disappointment realm chaos experience like see iteration front though suspect wait future lord release game still many bug much less issue
settlement battle still significant issue reduction size garrison combined removal minor settlement battle situation made relatively minor irritation
said still area creative assembly need address point
immortal empire experience brings warhammer iii quality warhammer ii
noted year game initially launched significant problem
also noted team responsible initial warhammer iii experience separate team made progress bringing game par
find little concerning future title mean warhammer iii great warrior chaos dlc fantastic addition game creating new mechanic open exciting possibility future revamps future title creative assembly
think possible chaos dwarf dlc also expansion mechanic expands horizon possible total war game
little expensive well developed faction added total war warhammer franchise date across game really solid space right think lot look forward future
hello guy ussualy never must say couple word gamei never liked play lot cause shooting terrible comparison main reason writting yet pro arrived gold nova aiming go even beyondbut still think goodmain reason cheater yeah nowadays play one proper match without report people
prime user even see cheater nobody perfectly safe
wa talk mode match filled kid think cheating fun cool awesome nobody kill
trying help friend escape low level order play serious people hopefully without cheat use anyone else problem like
solution progress
game destined go soon
never able go back normal total war game good good combat good graphic music even art part beautiful
probably many said game still fit state design choice campaign hopefully eliminated introduction immortal empire problem game run far unresponsive even massive update released week back often run completely different direction one ordered extremely visible new imo enjoyable settlement battle map designer seem ever played game total war also happen open map unit walk wrong direction refuse move take order rest missile unit often fire enemy unit range would randomly swap target order fact game released state show utter contempt general rule never broken twice recently
time game cyberpunk reminded ca trust developer previous work indication future product
executive greed disrespect paying customer sadly prevalent gaming industry
first saw trailer game thought space marine looked like amazing game due track record modern game released broken extremely hesitant game however looked heard conversation finally succumbed finally ultra edition could experience game worry others tell
go big go home right space marine best could ever spent money
even though review minor bug sabre still time polish whatever minor bug game fully space marine feel like game even
every game known man always fair share minor bug game minor best
game breaking bug anything
absolutely say game solid matter look
great job sabre interactive focus entertainment disclaimer space marine big game term size performance requirement
please read review bomb knowing rig may best
please reed spec list game play game may cause rendering issue lower end equipment
note gtx rx bare minimum gpus running game
anything lower experience rendering issue gameplay cutscenes
user discretion advised
build upon formula dark soul iii new way approach combat sneaking jumping mounted combat
world huge lot interesting enemy npc encounter
replay value likely strong point game plenty new spell weapon
animation asset recycled previous game enough new stuff make feel like new experience
performance rough time though team rolling patch mitigate issue
seems basically copied dark soul iii except item used host session much easier obtain
really like see make design improvement allowing player area even bos defeated similar small white soapstone dark soul ii
overall lot fun game far expect experiment new build new many hour
one worst dlc scheme ive seen
enjoy game play enough
unbelievable amount content locked behind paid dlc
charge adding blood game
war game based large scale battle charge extra see blood
want play faction look interesting
need dlc
want use cool unit faction access
need right dlc since review put many hour game would fair leave negative review
began understand concept able appreciate different faction mechanic affect game play replay ability
total war community yt sure allowed enjoy game way think possible
recommend buying game buying dlc sale china extra point symbolic reference chinese classic literature
external video game effect ring context chinese world game visually impressive fall short key area
bos design lack creativity
game world feel static frozen time missing dynamic atmosphere could bring life
additionally noticeable disconnect character environment inhabit weakens overall immersion
awesome fantastic combat variety improved ai updated space marine excels ranged melee combat
game offer vast array gun ton customization option allowing create unique gun build suit actual gun build
variety combined smooth shooting mechanic add lot depth fun combat keeping thing fresh tweak experiment melee combat equally impressive
game feature three distinct type defense block balanced fencing
blocking let absorb damage allow parrying
balanced offer mix blocking parrying fencing skip blocking altogether giving larger window perfect parry
mastering system especially balanced fencing turn true killing machine close game also shine combat
face wide variety enemy type fighting style
example might find swarmed small minion elite enemy lock onto
add layer strategy intensity
health system might seem bit confusing first consists actual character health lost contested health represented white bar
regain health fight contested health deplete quickly slowly depending situation
also unlock skill enhance ability also provide buff game shorter side clocking around hour depending difficulty setting still blast play
ai improved significantly teammate fighting properly longer ignored enemy
also prioritize reviving downed adding balance solo space marine excellent hope devs continue update add content
love see take page darktide make mission customization feel fleshed
continued lack critical bug support seems getting worse better combined dlc price gouging pushed one favourite game series hard recommend positively surprised much content game offer monke bonk kill bos devs appreciated everything garbage corporate suit ruin everything good filling time spend time nerve hurtingand cheater make crazy dont let pretty graphic fool siege still improved much
made somewhat dynamic considering build somethings like shoddy tower barricade generic look instead faction specific shame really furthermore wall useless rather
siege still fully
real shame considering shogun medieval
may seem like something small considering siege make vast majority battle campaign really worth
hoped way atleast old siege mechanic like sapping wall section one make dwarven cathay city also look pathetic considering supposed unassailable meh game received many balance update since first game optimization greatly improved allowing faster race faction much balanced start location changed expansion released
monkey pole good came game fetish chicken
playing game realised every map chicken slowly got angrier game
lack chicken boiled blood
csgo made angry found dream love deathmatch

soul searching
wait sale even go sale wait immortal empire added cause right game despicable extremely slow game finished absolutely released state say massive fan franchise owns every single game state recommend certain time referenced come game playable buy away still recommend sale though
like crafting survival post apocalyptic good game bug glitch free game kinda hard believe much content nice world building recommend blackmailing nice behaviour
ca yea longer fun enjoyable playbut warhammer space marine fun enjoyable game far early accessalthough touch campaign due inflation friend still recommend playing itoperation eternal war mode give actually lot fun long end asian server fishing
apparently new meta review bomb new game logging exiting within minute span
devs within minute fixed launch issue
regard alleged selling information tos b one ever gave f get every company take information sell whether like despite clicking disagree agree
download game play damn clown
crash hitching aside elevated soul formula greater height could hoped

huge saber
heresy
good game
far perfect game lot inconsistency missing feature would come expect title
try best break honest
long time warhammer fan reference
campaign campaign good great
feel like wanted combine god war
ultimately fell tad short based opinion
series packed brim lore amazing character
felt like missing experience
felt bit complacent dull
moment good moment bad
overall felt inconsistent experience
wow factor start wear pretty quickly
experience time
start losing touch real fast
space marine two different experience offer
campaign operation mode
campaign much expect game
fun moderately paced great friend
operation mode feel like lack quite repeatability
every mission change grab objective corpse
modifier anything else think keep fresh experience less bland one
variation get class armor
""
thats huge
warhammer offer variation one mission operation mission combined
thats big oof ask
ever really feel like running mission really worth time becomes boring repetitive quite quickly
truly shame feel like selling point game operation mode
versus mode ok looking call duty wrong game
looking counter strike wrong game
looking laggy server unbalanced class unbalanced weapon bugged multiplayer search lobby
right place
versus mode game heresy
work champion chaos
totally mess borderline unplayable fun
entire versus experience feel rushed
bulwark lobby tanking bullet different marine shooting directly
idea
think good design pvp scenario
sniper deal almost damage
idea
would anyone even try play jetpack marine get instantly shot sky
idea
versus actually worst part game
recommend enough
really worst part game feel rushed absolute joke say least
play
server horrible weapon unbalanced frankly class belong
please play sake lol
achievement achievement beating game angel death
know hard
mean tell recognition
nice
great game
definitely one best series since soulstorm dark crusade vermentide
payed game
got scammed lack content replayability game currently offer
really hope game get beef bone time move
get ready experience going feel one time never come back nothing keep playing
emperor protects
modern classic without equal
game nothing unique done well feel like
fun game right away really hit chapter freaking hooked
something lore story telling relatively deep rpg element combat feel damn fun play
im half way game time writing review much fun add good vibe online game
said drive anyone else crazy game terrain climbing mechanic
know thats typical soul like game dude come monkey king cant even climb rock tree
maybe sequel lol wish ran faster like sekiro first total war game total war shogun released
loved several game franchise including total war warhammer
game disappointing
innovate animation graphical quality
prologue created boring city battle fun play
innovate formula way ai still crap behavior always feel every way expansion warhammer buy game
best game played soo far year goty sure
payed c go like game get deleted especially payed
good game good story hope there dlc skin skill best experience graphic visual story fighting combat combination ummahh think better elden ring sekiro teh emporor prtoects fun game ca wait full release week ago diagnosed terminal illness doctor given year best
glad able play go
know many see recommend play game see
gameplay atmosphere graphic
everything masterfully crafted
read thank good bye
product received free blood blood god
good right
maybe worth playing
quick summary first played every game fromsoft starting dark soul view bb best roughly hour across series done everything game
elden ring fails soul game opinion would recommend despite could great game
fantastic visuals world interesting sometimes awful repetitive boss enemy different coat paint zero direction player useless crafting system unrewarding story easily missable exposition dump character appears certain grace notice talk button appeared
normally issue story game environment item description telling knowing need become elden lord world got way kinda sapped motivation consisted exploring find new thing
tell thing dark soul fire integral big tree really boring naming convention eld erd every name start seriously marika mohg mohgwyn malenia melina miquela millicent miriel rune instead scooby go par course series exponentially worse grace point towards nearest lord medallion might need legacy dungeon horrific stormveil come mind could imagine new player experiencing fresh hell game encourages go first instead nice southern area get tear three secret area within dumb design consecrated snowfield haligtree blood area missed despite fact hold one lord boss drop great reward exploring pitiful see item behind illusionary wall protected hard mob
crafting flower infinite respawn area
killed hard bos
useless ash summon
armour farmed enemy bought honestly think dark soul better enemy variety lambasted dude armour game go different area exact knight footsoldiers different coloured armour composition ally
get enemy reused seriously see every area oh reskinned mob previous game make visit like reskinned monkey world look phenomenal especially underground environment like nokron despite goofy stuff might reference take like night cavalry aka nazgul godfrey joestar blaidd literally crafting system brings nothing value formula think crafted one stack arrow item discovery boost arrow bought better quality buildup resist item never necessary firebomb myriad variant borderline useless hitting thing stick quicker less likely get punished missing
usable item challenge run interesting boss horrific multiple slightly beefed mob health bar name gank fight happen often artificially pump difficulty boss big arena fight camera tree spirit suck fly high ca see dragon consist please dive bomb breathe fire
unique boss fast high damage attack tracking multiple distance closing attack standard attack aoe effect think twin prince overhead lawrence bb form delayed attack like nameless king
see issue
boss went time playing similar rule player big weapon long reach big damage slow even bloodborne lesser extent understood like ludwig aoe attack used limited attack easy tell fast backhand attack would little damage borderline one tap even overleveled vigour
single bos enjoyable memorable great like artorias gwyn maria friede gael soul cinder genchiro fume knight ludwig
went game praying good bos closest got malenia fast stupidly felt fair spammed one b attack killing pure luck never used move
every soul game looked forward next bos learning fight like dance sheer dread flavour lawrence kill time
bloodborne favourite game high speed gameplay love game suffers mobility keep optimisation also rubbish worked fine mileage may game meant solo player clearly designed around spamming ash summons go everything knew series
honestly want play unlike others excited
went almighty miyazaki expect see shill comment hitting git gud x hour recommend please disappoint
changed opinion expecting review blow much day wrote gotten game hacker enemy team guy spin botting
call bad terrible better iv playing since know legit blatantly kill csgo different look like overwatch
im afraid csgo dying worried new player dealing cheating getting annoyed cheat
many cheater
vac good anti recommend buying prime unless willing deal day cheater hopefully good trust factor really implement trust factor xp bar something tell good
current system broken sometimes cheater new account sometimes year old player obviously cheating
current system broken need still sit think ill link video soon bought new account played game good cheater played another one
spinbotters crash server dont get overwatched corrupts demo
proof review counterstrike always amazing game
reason downfall due community us cheat
vac worst anti cheat something year old could bypass computer class school
code wall less hour
there nothing protecting game
valve project destroy csgo implement another anti cheat
eac better dont waste money game trust factor low queing people low trustfactor worst thing
cheater hvh mm
suggest removing trust factor fix
que someone get day due kicking player around comp low trust factor que sake valve fix game
remove scum u legit old player actually fun time instead leaving game game worth purchasing play already good trust factor
prefaceelden ring mark two occasion worth mentioning
first changing review format point previous format used last two year game caliber justice
second elden ring arguably firm reminder gamers past present future generation renaissance sort long overdue gaming industry
plagued predatory practice aaa company marked endless greed exploitation general public gaming industry stand today decaying since late
believe elden ring along handful game begun slowly surely lead u another golden era gaming need although game term achievement main character within roughly hour review delayed wanted see least truly see game open world loading screen vast world explore without disruption importantly executed zero bug
moment walk certain area come realization big world actually find awe every hour
genuine wtf momentsclass versatile large number class choose without hard restriction player engage world however see fit appropriate attribute allocation spell memory ash war loadouts combati never thought mounted combat would ever feel better played witcher elden ring taken another level
feel good drag around zweihander across ground throw enemy many open world game like disguise elden ring set new bar
every nook cranny accessible invisible wall locked behind stone key unlike game block exploration questingwe likely heard news game devs throwing shade elden ring player definitely side support elden ring breaking status quo
freedom explore right choose fundamental factor make experience unique memorable
company like ubisoft gotten far content design one big one
elden ring virtually perfected art allowing player literally choose difficult game becomes scale
ingenious move say hey first story bos
either go starting gear come back clearing dungeon beefing bit
complain lack easy mode point negativesstorytelling lore expositioni one minor nitpick one certainly arguable
personally find fromsoftware game become vague storytelling
different field praising open exploration design
say lore bad understand extent like leave thing open interpretation wish would little revealing term exposing player going play
player like u used interpreting event based npc tell u vague dialogue player especially new game keen deciphering story bit bit
fromsoftware game game desperately need encyclopedia section main verdict elden ring grand masterpiece justly deserves praise
game year
game decade
let hope many company follow suit
said single player game dead
monkey love play enjoy sims monster prime war lag mostly fixed game good hopefully injects testosterone current generation
ape together strong
bad game never fun software magnum opus many people leaving bad review hour game released simply could create another character right away even though devs said planning adding additional character creation later
streamed earlier
game run smooth crafting building easy map gigantic mention game free
battle pas buy game get extra stuff devs mentioned get weapon free
arguably best free game ever played
highly recommend anyone give shot
pretty combat music good voice acting good visuals great challenge fair
updated waiting flip negative review
immortal empire turned campaign planetwide bloodbath meant
polished performance two campaign one crash
one
look good play good ca still dropping content
mention something like nation game first good graphic great sound design top notch knew would
new map beautiful chaos waste associated mechanic interesting
time get past review medium gave really good new siege mechanic nightmare
old way might slog instead updating city map look great added supply system let defender build defense reinforce unit almost indefinitely
every battle walled settlement one rts mission one like one side get handful unit get fully functional fortress campaign another gimmicky scenario battle wave wave enemy side
hour warhammer struggled finish campaign kislev normal
one good struggle like passing kidney stone
would rather slam sack door try add huge mortal empire style world map soon
none faction playable giant step backward term content
devs work otherwise hopeful good modder come along disables siege junk keep new map faction
nice well recommended anymore
dlc quality gone downhill severely price continues rise
meanwhile major bug plague base game well previous dlcs
dream ai

however cheater premier matchmaking faceit decided break entire game
vac live non existent people kill spawn wall whilst bhopping cheater thing could csgo fine least could play faceit tick server assured u would get
oh look nope hardcode subtick even though proven working better
oh well let go play csgo oh cant either false ban one one caused update
promptly removed grateful compensation word community silence ok well let set aside move oh ca exploit never life wondered safe play game forcing player base play unpolished game cheater without active client sided anticheat serverside plugins fog war
punish people boosting cheater even cheating self allow flex brag publicly leader board
cheater pro supposed game level playing field would get fair chance compete
counter strike everyone
counter strike dying guy shot
love counter strike first game played uncle internet cafe little kid lost entire summer
guy dev team company lost respect player base game
throw u bin time flex incoming major
might need climb high horse play game u talk community little
actually respond feedback
counter strike one dedicated community sure paid even fraction back u investment would pay ten fold guy
immortal empire open everybody barrier entry vastly lower
need total war warhammer access
certainly recommend immortal empire experience edit billion setting change update game run like dream
understand want understand gon na go enjoy land
play game review negative
yes game time writing
yes game incredible
""
port terrible
ram nvidia super gpu cpu
everything driver
shader cache set unlimited
every fix seen people online worked
playing invisible enemy frame drop top previous low fps
today update made worse
good conscience give great game positive review issue port fixed
mean purchase game issue keep playing anything less deserves immediate refund
first buy game constantly play less u addicted
start fade top game list
every nice hop comp game friend
game always fun play time time
perfect every way imaginable
absolute gem surprise u
great see china really invest step gaming entertainment department
must buy
ca remember last time much fun game
generation defining action rpg must play
one best adventure game everdevelopers advantage taking well developed world one famous story
took delivered
game wide variety enemy backstory obviously taken chinese folklore still slightly enlarge understanding world
world story enough give game try even fan aspect consists chapter unique enemy cast exception corresponding boss
remember entering thought lol enemy reskins earlier one lazy devs
game would perceive norm fact perceived minus speaks highly enemy variety divide two part chief king
mixed king shiny move guess boss vacuum awesome place world backstory cool move good loot
also balanced pretty good adventure game even tho wish harder co amount boss first try facetanked unhealthy opinion
hand heard people struggle lot different boss opinion objective
yes also struggled two boss map also awesome unique biome gorgeous view
normal adventure type map branching path end bos
game map menu navigating finding secret quite time consuming especially map failed opinion experiment openworld type map
literally nothing except bad boss one
boss bad
hate type boss puzzle bos catch bos
like boss game without technical problem coursefirst camera
camera get behind tree wall annoying
also camera tracking quite loose move around around bos much bos mobile moveset field view good fight
also lose target lock bos move manually readjust camera fight annoying use gamepad problem input example run button wo register pressed move annoying problem lack target tracking
like know lazy bos designer add insane target tracking move boss designer went deeper heavy attack roll case miss mark completely hitting enemy going random particle air extremely frustrating spent like minute charge despite problem game still awesome boss still manageable due variety build ability redo build time trouble remembering name character game book movie especially multiple name start ring malenia miquella marika mohg morgott margit melina maliketh miriam maleigh marais miriel millicent mary maureen moongrumradahn radagon renna ranni rennala rykard rogier roderika rileigh ryagideon godfrey godrick godwyn gostoc gowry ghiza godefroy grafted goldmask gurranqgeorge martin secret bos confirmedcool game tho since old fan halo game find c go nice sequel franchise
jump awp ak make headshot like true like since ez eagle right going supreme easly thanks real dlc game deserve russian
halo russian game full
since game easy hard play silver level eagle level russian make game quite challenging
like got one team know game thug battle
kidding love
thanks valve best hal ehm c ever made
writing tin say dark soul open world
get exactly say tin give take quirk
rare case conversion done combat old soulsborne system already made mind whether like extra tweak variety
elden ring really excels open world exploration wrap
strong art direction coupled intruiging writing make sight worth seeing reward loop exploring borderline addictive
every single little cave camp crevasse keep bos unique item reward beating making ludicrously large assortment build go
course come standard high difficulty attached
practice spike hardship make satisfying goal work towards via sharp edge however need acclimate
bit cake eat design showered lot weapon still need stick one upgrade
get really boring course hundred hour moveset narrow
item spell balanced around pvp instead solo play
unintuitively lead upgrade downgrade practice
wo able tell invested lot resource unlocking upgrading
also plenty thing watch make game harder aware
game designed
bossfights tuned challenging even two player bouncing aggro
mean playing solo summon part build much anything else
forgoing make thing exponentially
game expects explore level lot
try stick critical path beat quickly possible rude surprise later half game due sheer amount damage enemy deal
build made equal
experience vary lot based whether ranged attack going melee
especially since boss big melee range mean ca see necessarily shortcoming
think indirect difficulty setting
go easiest approach scenario challenge extra thrill
mindset thing aware going
game sublime
encounter odd glitch weird physic interaction way polished expect genre
false game ban griefing cooldown gambling laundering simulator
ok tos stuff might load crap standard
game prompting elevation time run need admin oh trying access credential stored lsass got ta love crowdstrike falcon great av product
need buckle fellow adventurer take mythical journey extraordinary realm black myth wukong
legend unfolds moment stepped ancient world felt pulse magic
forest whispered secret pagoda stood like silent sentinel guarding forgotten knowledge
wukong rebellious hero radiated charisma
staff crackled energy eye held weight poetry picture wukong surrounded foe staff extension
swing brushstroke canvas chaos
combat system dance elegance brutality
pirouetted enemy formation deflecting arrow delivering spinning kick sent demon sprawling
bos battle
symphony strategy spectacle
faced serpent scale like jade thunder deity crackling lightning fox spirit
encounter left breathless heart canvas dream visuals
artist dipped brush starlight painted landscape defy reality
cherry blossom swirled wind ancient temple clung cliff like stubborn memory
wukong ascended mountain peak world unfolded tapestry wonder
animated vignette end chapter
pure magic
revealed antagonist tragic past leaving haunted hungry fate story weave thread classic journey west
like sipping tea sun wukong listening tale god demon
sure reference might elude newcomer breadcrumb leading deeper mystery
reveled lore piecing together prophecy ancient glitch grin okay let address quirk
occasionally game hiccupped like startled dragon
crash
yep
character switching language
confusing oddly endearing
gear system
well like wukong got caught cosmic thrift store
upgrading staff felt like polishing yearned impactful black myth wukong game odyssey
flaw
sure like crack porcelain charm
grab staff channel inner monkey king step world myth breathe legend clash
regret
probably one best game best soulslike sorry nioh ever played
really ca think last time blast aaa title
minor thing didnt enjoy like stupididly overpowered enemy gameplay feature like horse combat overall open world exploration work amazing soulslike perfomance personally didnt problem stuttering frame drop crashed time playthrough even rig minimal spec stable high setting
highly recommend even new soul ranni best girl best ending
absolute blast playing game even playing pvp hate pvp like hack slash horde shooter might game also fan game rus allfather mean guilliman empereor much review poster probably see third review writing played hundred upon hundred game mean third game really made want write hour game yes really took time first run literally beat game hour ago aswell let tell game absolute masterpiece
wish express detail feel game ca good
last time felt excited hyped super happy playing game elden ring came game managed bring feeling forward game damn pretty graphic insane literally built pc game worth combat world fluid engaging absolutely loved every character met cutscene animation ending chapter treat watch oh mention intro
think game top intro wukong sh absolutely epic ui fantastic amazing bos design based chinese believe list keep going yeah game beast
could keep going dont want make review way line buy game phenomenal
hoping game win goty absolutely deserves award
rating
monkee price increase bad fix content good original negative review game
pc version stutter lot make unnecessarily difficult play
masterpiece best game ever made already ruined life clearly unfinished optimization point view
fix issue confident software rewrite review soyjak game like redditor visiting elon lithium stuff stutter become less frequent really care anymore
game masterpiece get enthralled happening screen ca tell running fps
first played sekiro could go back dark soul seemed slow boring comparison
giving effect make previous game feel incomplete comparison
melee combat tied sekiro fave game
even made magic fun somehow
still run best enough justify recommending game everyone
there lot added year campaign map feature building outpost faction settlement war coordination better option quest issued faction well setting quest faction many quest centered around map element well
interesting event occur campaign overall say turn based campaign portion total war never better
faction different warhammer allowed interesting system implemented keep playthrough fresh
mechanic behind faction drive play differently played last really sucked back total war first time year
rpg element deeper ever understand never draw total war truthfully fantasy setting found add great layer gameplay really enjoy
sending army stack go epic quest leading lord truthfully fun af feel like every lord even randomly generated one develop whole story
meanwhile still playing total engine best time around ever
run smooth scarcely believe
using cpu played attila difference night day
ai issue unit mass seems perfect animation best game play extremely well even keep wall
really exciting play imo stepped away total war time coming back huge breathe fresh air
good fiance never played kind game took immediately
still warhammer version total war expect extremely powerful lord rpg feature game prof next historical title engine ai improvement alone
big leap forward total war suck way monetize game though
wish steam rating star based could take star
admit
something locked insanely unique impressive deserve king genre frustrating stumble list dlc insane price
still sell blood game
one thing give made blood blood god warhammer game unlocks warhammer great accolade feel right giving first epic fantasy total war game greedy publisher
throne decay among change great change hopefully ca continues momentum leave game fantastic state year two
thanks listening fan feedback ca hope see either total war even world war total war point
monke strong far favourite game time
killed protetced
eat tablespoon mayonnaise every like review get
missing good old day csgo try fingersbut hole hour gameplay logged tonight greeted notice permanently banned main server without clear explanation
support available discord bot provided requested detail informed banned using cheat software allegedly gave unfair advantage
even ended message bizarre note wishing good life hoping leave positive issue seems stem process hacker alternative task manager installed pc
many player experienced banned due false positive found real help customer support
bot method contact frustratingly unhelpful experience support game effectively
strongly advise anyone thinking playing stick experience spend money address issue establish proper support team
discord bot adequate support game paying customer
like team fortress gun
best game game outstanding cant get enough excited see come
throne decay fantastic return form must forget forgive ca management tried hold game hostage squeeze extra money playerbase less
support actual devs poured heart game get thrown layoff incompetent sleazebags almost ruined game managerial staff get coast golden parachute
dlc pricing lack bug fix make game shadow could
complete failure
month fixed barely anything removed timeless game originally paid
putting early even close ready complete insult
worst company status go valve game finally released real time best game ever played
game support ultrawide monitor
also possible get banned using fix internet forced play game outside steam
really hope someday problem resolved play game
elden ring game good great game tl dr fun competitive game
toxic side like multiplayer game
would recommend
game epitome reflex
love game simple yet complex strategy implied
test mechanical skill also make really put mental effort
really fun competitive man lobby
thank heaven game enables access setting menu whilst queuing match due year
new ui seems innovative suppose still room improvement
average number hour
pro con game pro love fast paced competitive game game
simple breaking wall yet fun lot achieve success victory fun whatever objective set set word
could also make great game play casually game find kind player mostly lower rank
ranking system motivate play get better
besides competitive classic game mode many others choose
community made map skin give better experience
updated new map change existing map change economy etc lead creating new metas
party matchmaking client esea sostronk faceit offer opportunity stable better server tick tournament various period time ranking system lot prize really brings thus leading newer better experience one take game seriously one play casually alike
active entertaining content provides really show human capable impossible
pretty cool community played lot game part many community got say c go community pretty cool
one smartest one humorous community twitch reddit youtube unlike game least one platform cancerous better part
ah extremely attractive female streamer pro matchmaking server worst
know devs planned game
server never stable really ruin experience u
game point u gon na request valve upgrade mm server tick really need resort party client many u really want time
many bug stuff abused map game take forever get fixed
know long shot since took year make accessible queue match would great option choose server
indian pinoys literally worst
generalising know make difference generalise never good experience player nation
ruin game
ca one fun match without incompetent indian cry mic hindi really
like shut dude
always looking something blame extremely annoying rush first die comment say mental breakdown mic
thank goodness game capable block communication feature
even know get rank intellectually incapable self
extremely bad hold team
super toxic
mind losing fair part game game ruined player
coming overpopulated country get enough attention ca get due lack special talent show frustration mic ruin experience u
video youtube get super popular c go community player try whatever bug discovered etc
incompetency fail fun productive
request indian please try stuff see video
hold iq threshold people match
ruin game
sure every region like fair c go let u choose server reduce risk getting game indian whoever underdeveloped brain
hacker smurfs still existence despite effort valve
bum exchanged lot time effort get rank hacker smurf get paired definite loss elo point
ruined game became
game turned server became worse due high load removed option report server
like knew bound happen
great game struggled stable mm server make game introduce battle royale existence danger zone
poorly optimised game anybody get fps know huge drop fps smoke etc
hope valve something server add feature game instead funding garbage like artifact nobody give
new player
get friend play begin
known player
completely customise game look
crosshair viewmodel etc adjusted convenience
make use
watch video
""
team general mic cancer teammate
type console fun game taste competitiveness
lower skill curve yet hard master
would recommend first review long think would read regardless whether relate review thank spending time
really appreciate
sorry mistake committed noticed change
unfinished game lot less feature previous multiple bug lot really big cathay faction adventure battle except last one story battle weapon battle less hero lord trait defeating legendary lord automatic resolve broken make player lose ton unit even predict settlement battle reworked make fun interesting instead become tedious want finish fast lack said going focused instead receive mechanic game like rift make really boring frustrating map feel worse previous one lot empty diplomacy system much worse ia make senseto sum play instead ca remember last time strong negative feeling game particularly hate
enjoyed possibly less minute game rest time forcing play try find something positive
really warhammer enough people play game worth ai squadmates horrible little term tanking main campaign game get stale quickly unresponsive ability high emphasis melee combat higher difficulty making class dodge parry mechanic unique control middle mouse button aim high learning curve player pain point new long loading screen even gorgeous epic story feel update still stunning smooth gameplay stable performance visually stunning looting exploring great fun
also incredibly diverse range item world seems pretty huge ca understand steam allows people give negative rating queued global release date wait get server pc good enough
simply outrageous rating included overall rating thus present completely false picture
hope enough people understood steam rating generally value anymore
unsure whether game check review youtube instead
hate game
played anything campaign far hour
take
warhammer fan must buy
fan idea person doom style experience top execution fun selection melee ranged weapon must buy
waiting game year largely delivered gripe
gripe annoying bug enemy game
hour session friend managed bug encounter would force u reload last checkpoint least time
luckily checkpoint rather frequent get set far back still annoying
gripe camera position fov control
wish could pan camera back even little bit
titus massive space marine take rather significant portion screen
get armor detailed want see enemy coming teeth
able back camera would nice
also remember seeing setting change position camera right shoulder left preference middle
gripe bolter sound design lackluster
sound like pack punch get wrong
sound like firing gun launching caliber mass reactive shell
darktide bolter chunky sound far better justice
thought going able play immortal empire alone
turn spend additional game want dlc
wish heard somewhere bought late hour
gave cancer playing hour obviously enjoying game really looking forward
however soon game dissapointment immeasurable day ruined
lot feature gameplay buggy nothing new ca unfortunately motivation play campaign turn usually nowhere found due state game
minor fix coming month change much enjoy game much time ca kept churning dlc dlc less less content major issue still persisted base game
several year passed developer still unable make game enjoyable stating need money keep support
absolutely inacceptale refrain buying anything ca ever cost honestly content dlc buggy main game amount
luckily game studio worth looking buy ca gone greedy dev route sign change anytime soon
weak foe ahead bloodstain surrounding message suffer xenos mutant heretic
leave beautiful capybara whoever pass pet give thumb need steam point easy mode like assassin creedengine quest log mini mapno quick time eventsno cgi introthe game literally unplayable
soul game time
complete master piece genre including element sekiro improving refining
still old engine combat hit box timing animation next world day night cycle easy entry point hard recommend reading every bos encounter online every item enjoy discovery learning read react boss first time around greatly increase combat experience sharder cache issue stutter loading new area
apart smoothest bug free release last addicted game start hating much since vlave coud stop cheat hack game csgo mmr player using wh get ban really upset recommend game unless playing lan enviroment
writing review never torn whether recommend game campaign moment make warhammer fan giddy like kid christmas especially last two mission played know
even non warhammer fan good time
voice acting graphic audio strong
however criminally short
took hour complete died lot
ai game something
squad mate watch getting annihilated budge inch decide stand front attempt lay waste heretic
infuriating something need get used online matchmaking straight cheek
hope enjoy restarting game lot loading screen become familiar
bug crash loooong loading time infinite loading time going likely infest experience worse tyranid could game already pushed back considerable amount time
core game play really solid
third person shooter fan especially enjoyed gear war going great time
challenging brutal unapologetic approach
know target audience swing fence time game live die next month much dev support
fixing myriad tech issue bringing content coop multiplayer
map needed
real mixed bag
frustrating disappointing mixed bag within room filled potential
could something truly special going reluctantly recommend purely warhammer fan moment game perfection non warhammer fan wait sale
time feel many issue fixed landscape looking like content make worthwhile
top favorite game time
""
stop comparing enjoy
playing pretty much every day since july putting ton hour since
game fun awhile getting endgame running ton game breaking bug killed fun
prime war large group people pretty much pve endgame boss bug become immune entire server lag bad ca even shoot switch weapon
rare occurrence happen every prime war
devs done nothing address instead kept adding higher higher difficulty
last update added new public event called ancient one trial excited climbed way top mountain realize event bugged could start
added tameable animal course also bugged
disappear tameness reset completely bug floor escape
course everything instead fixing major bug game since started added loot box stupid enough buy currency account
woopsies currency mine given many player error spent well account negative pay get back buy anything game maybe come back year two abandoned
fantasticcampaign alone worth content planned rest year game gon na great
surprised game well optimized given beautiful look
real downside seen far pvp mode ping horrendous everyone
oddly enough make kinda fair one ex always go back hippity hoppitythis review blood raven property game definitely rough launch realm chaos campaign great opener however putting nearly hour game solidly say incredible
yes issue one would love overhaul older legendary lord lookin malekith opportunity fun strategically role playing wise immense
game held attention long worth buying price one prolog lit main campaign suck turn campaign mechanic becomes big nuisance change seems good direction currently buggy pathfinding new settlement slogfest best melee clash unit bug stay one place teabag unit way micro freak selecting target must left fire campaign technology work break mechanic battle army abbilities work work battels feel like mobile game ai tower constantly small reconstruction time penalty forced rush buggy pathfinding becomes mess like total anarchy level weak compared daemon faction legendary lord daemon prince weak hell autoresolve broken kislec fair race others make play every battle unit armor make weak autoresolve reason slanesh would recomend game main campaign
want imortal campaign yes would recomend bring trilogy together
update game please scroll end review put hr total war game series
hour spent warhammer fan hater giving honest opinion campaign warhammer force type play using limited army play mole rift opening cause balance corruption territory forced claiming demon soul element annoying boring equal story line poor opinion
many gamers already stated option turn least adjust tempo chaos portal collection would improved game hugely many player like campaign others like play slower domination type expansionist game list go basically option going outside limited rushed linear play style taken found campaign restrictive fun
think campaign fixable would need complete redesign
honestly sad say warhammer opinion worth buying present due high price would recommend warhammer anyone new free empire upgrade becomes available update review advice save money something looking online feel creative assembly sadly replying customer attempt making view known knowledge acknowledgement made campaign poorly received player base many widely made criticism also publicly creative assembly banned staff mentioning anything would affect sale figure
wall silence product deafening slightly annoying u game bought early full price get feel sad say warhammer uninstalled campaign boring frustrating first time replay value
fan hope better game future hold breath
really feel let game especially ad hype developer
big price tag deeply flawed game
update stats top game even warhammer still clinging say changing review positive empire released game release
although developer calling beta played around hour found stable
game well supported moment update patch coming thick fast refreshing change previous total war empire fantastic game well worth money
absolute crap
forcibly replaced c go even system officially supported like linux macos player like found ca play game suddenly
note c go like drug start playing csgo hate cant stop playing cuz get addicted
""
start playing nice game playing hour different account hour game ck full cheater toxic player want troll good play fun r friend care win losebut important go play another game youeven play face toxic player guy want troll need like level face get normal guy want win teamwork stuff like anti cheat trash valve care cuz ban account sell copy trash gameat first like spending hour past week even hour past weeksthis game got achievement get legally need download extra map use achievement app get valve adding new operation every year let game die like giving water dead plant make alive nothing happen recommend game paid game removed
absolute disgusting release new game keep old one people paid
let preface love
met many cool people year played many laugh good time blast
however say purely casual
hour game decided try get competitive scene
got buddy together gradually progressing silver rank know call bad etc
good fun
win lose point got higher higher stopped fun
reason
absolutely piss poor matchmaking security valve end
understand one bad game got point consitently terrible
point stopped queing less full lobby
couple friend would get qued people ping basically worse bot leave entire match
experience like fun
worst part though amount painfully obvious hacker game
vac poorest excuse system ever seen
one hacker basically carry entire team time enemy team wo integrity kick blatant hacker carry next rank
report cheap game problem people make another account
valve make enough money game justify better system
honestly one saddest example company giving community think gaming industry
say want ea money hungry company hate fan guarantee wo run many hacker official dice battlefield server official csgo server
sad
love game
want play casual community probably great time learning quirk game learning map engaging goofy as community come
however competitive scene pure cancer
hope valve read even though highly doubt truly want best game
tks campaign still hilariously awful month release
behind first rift never able win campaign conventionally without spending upwards another turn sending leader army across map remove faction game thus eventually freeing faction leader finally get soul need
made lord could actually use rift traverse map even ca get chaos god area would functional able delay even prevent faction leader entering rift letting catch wait immortal empire least game mode enjoyable
week ago diagnosed terminal illnes doctor given year best
glad able play masterpiece go
know many people see recomend buy game see
gameplay atmosphere boss ost everything masterfully crafted
thank fromsoftware game
maidenless first maidenless
update currently maidenless quite impressed game term gameplay visuals finishing introduction
excited start playing rest game sister
however ever recommend game forcibly installs unnecessary epic game bloatware pc upon initial launch
bought steam game play player steam
well actually lovely sister gifted game statement remains otherwise
thank much si
fortunately long care crossplay game entirely functional without epic game online easily removed installation
launch game
game immediately attempt install epic online service
cancel installation box finish
met error message upon reaching main menu
eos never successfully installed remnant software still turn crossplay game option menu close game
uninstall epic online service list program delete epic online service folder game installation folder steam reboot computer relaunch game
game greet error message reach main menu whenever start game eos never attempt install machine
game fully functional without crossplay
enjoy space marine
leave cat friend pas pet give thumb フ l ヽ ﾉ death great teacher
failure global offensive always series greatest way learn gone done could done better
player spend lot time learning consequently always getting better
growth important factor global offensive especially coming fresh sabbatical
extremely hardcore shooter force think differently modern shooter
call duty player going need change play style succeed
also try developing something new well despite little push beyond always done best
global offensive modifies old map keep veteran toe introduces official new mode encourage different play style first time almost year
uninitiated global offensive shooter permanent death
kill terrorist planting explosive classic defusal match ct escort swallow sniper round hostage rescue victim dead good respawn next round
player side must exercise skill care
bomb objective meanwhile give everyone purpose
course match end everyone team dead clever coordinated terrorist team give ct slip plant bomb protect bomb site
round everyone spends earned cash better gear gun cycle continues
piece formula dated point superb heart soul global offensive timeless
team small gun lethal round short
addictive quality constant desire better last time earn satisfying kill win new way
call duty battlefield vet wonder ca sprint escape enemy fire look iron sight improve aim player feel like walked redecorated home
certain map redesigns catch hardcore fan guard change best underpass choke point instance new escape route
even face genre evolution global offensive care adapt
csgo dedicated aging ideal despite market trend change way success
part make engaging competitive game killing global offensive requires wholly different skill set shooter
everyone limited see little room character modification advantage
running gunning useless play style even bought helmet kevlar round point someone standing still likely score kill
walking crouching standing best bet reduce inaccurate spray fire
consequently killing global offensive feel good
sickening sensation dropping someone dead know coming back
also satisfying knowing used limited resource play smarter victim
player watching corner providing covering fire using smoke grenade flashbangs likely take headshot delicate patient triggerman
desire experience distinct feeling strong motivator keep playing even getting steamrolled obviously better team
played global offensive probably sound whole lot like
like source global offensive exists simply modernize look classic competitive shooter little disrupt core form function
time enough color outside line tradition justify time effort
fire one interesting new combat variable
molotov cocktail incendiary grenade either roast group guy force another direction
flame useful distraction scare tactic
particularly useful demolition match focus fight single bomb site rather giving terrorist two pick
new modified map mode big classic arena entire section cut direct team toward central location thoughtful design intricate ever
lake map standout wide open yet densely populated yard around bomb site inside sizable lakeside home plenty vantage point hiding spot
separate demolition defusal player ca buy round
instead take cue new mode arm race kill unlocks another weapon instantly
better switch way play demolition fast need quick foot
unlike game type arm race allows respawns
chaotic mode global offensive player throwing caution wind sake climbing kill ladder quickly possible
shame two map arm race problem likely persist console pc
option playing pc version unquestionably best way experience global offensive
mod mouse keyboard usual option better port
plus valve much better pc support abandoned team fortress console portal level editor pc exclusive
prefer play console global offensive great game outdid really weak addition fully recommended one best game time
really target audience elden ring given cup tea game phenomenal
despite really really game mechanically engaging beautiful visuals audio
although capped fps run buttery smooth never drop frame system
story complicated little complicated game target audience going roll slash boss without really paying attention cut scene flavor text
saying greatest open world game ever played say stop playing game actually branch
elden ring world jam packed content enemy always felt small easily traversed really compared large open world game
let realistic think goty even comparable great classic title like botw already think fromsoftware next game goty
real complaint multiplayer horrible
despite accessible game newcomer one thought allow player opt invasion
definitely lost opportunity
game hard enough without getting sweat people never seen outside world
playing friend clunky unintuitive tied item grind
fromsoftware clearly walked street pulled multiplayer design nintendo known ubiquitously horrible multiplayer implementation
multiplayer sound likely would given game hour
half baked
seems standard rush half finished game production cash ip ruining fan relationship serve business model publisher tired buying game wait another year actually playable campaign beat ok guess
hard time staying interested enough finish mod save game whenever get around actually happening
come back year maybe
feeling money duped stop
point fault wallet close
first review ever steam sad come circumstance hour csgo feel sick stomach want let people know
csgo dead devs letting cheater mostly russian plague server without batting eyelash
vac system useless overwatch
game turning hords hopelessly bad player came flooding server turning hack second get killed legit player
game player openly cheating activating spinbots speedhacks wallhacks recoil many single game day
shameful valve allow otherwise great game get dragged mud pathetically
huge waste industry also blatant message valve care community
disgusting would let loyal playerbase disgraceful manner
sad timesedit valorant coming one really realizes csgo actually hot garbage lol
servs trash netcode basically diceroll meaning aim count game developped poorly
glad getting rekt val valve deserves riot competitor company pile impotent fool clueless af

spend much money play anything like
base game basically let play chaos
everything else need buy stupid expensive dlc get buy warhammer

extremely mixed short think game cool original gameplay
though highly innovate still maintains gameplay going year
let talk community

think mlg kick good
kicked multiple time feel awful think people want team
make stomach drop bottomless beware abysmal community stick friend
work together friend prevent opposing team winning much better time would john going say amazing game totally recommend playing like competetive game play group friend fun
get mix darksouls skyrim think amazon trying new world
amaizing game payed make free year later become hacker paradise
hacker prime
even say nonprime
vac player opinion improve recommend new player play without prime help abit
someone loved first two game third first baffle response people mad dlc reception throw fuel fire try stomp conversation
talk topic sure silencing show care actually take community valid complaint consideration heard streisand effect
line right discus entitlement earn playing false people pay game let job love say even stupid one
word gain traction maybe look inward try see doom saying calling boycott conversation like appearing getting louder
game fun soon developer start trying hide stuff know ship sinking going board
greatly anticipated warhammer played hour since released month ago believe reflects interest int game enjoyment gained far superior game almost every aspect important much lack magic warhammer
would take refund gave game another go received major update
despite update changed opinion game good predecessor doubt immortal empire combined map faction change revisit released
played game best start ii game interlock allowing play faction introduced different game feature yet supported iii
whole much stronger state predecessor launch learned many lesson development yet expansive full complement dlc
enjoyed ii iii solid polish formula number new innovation
playing human like discovering new chinese takeout place
decide try new affordable end enjoying succulent meal

still people buy skin game generates put effort something old c go
million player every month
need take care better idea make freevalve expectation lot player play game ignore every banned cheater create another account continue destroying gaming experience really hesitating get game strongly advise getting
feel like every game infected little cheater parasite

valve forcefully destroying one game made today
simply acting
always thought one good big company opinion starting change
may every cheater pillow warm side forever
game suffers alot bug optimization get worse worse every patch
lower fps every patch matchmaking server filled cheater server good
high variance dipping server fps resulting inconsistent tiny bit hardcore source give nice feeling lower game play pug clan match
goty sure
awesome game thank game science
game idea enemy new encounter grind great alot positive attribute personally love weapon building aspec ridicoulus play server buy battle pass
server making character progressing part timeconsuming aswell
like game probably cant invite friend time writing server low population locked anyone make new mean numerous half empty shack ruining athmosphere also mean less spot end game progression wont end game content single piece inhibiting aspect completely ruin cant move character
basicly roll dice start
hoping wont end server dead spot wont play reserve spot non less
apart grind
cash put
follow server
character point give game big negative
thing fixed
triple ca believe inflation get payed less work bug get deep sale
really good gameplay good visuals
performance terrible talked enough
im getting fps frame generation dlss even maxing setting
lot weird flickering vegetation
turning setting alot give around fps drop certain fight
amongst worst performing game ever played
game comunity cancer worth playing full cheater product received free monke yeah yeah yeah performance could better limgrave open field
fix game run perfectly fine
still performance patch would appreciated come realization probably playing best game ever made
hour got lvl without story whatsoever
exploring gargantuan map many point interest
guess need way hour first playthrough see fair amount thing
edit
hour say
really near end think
initial assumption could well right
edit
finished game
right
took sweet as time man game huge
game make history amazing thank fromsoftware great game really excited see ie come beta
obvious reference aside something game find quite interesting bos fight game play like traditional arcade fighting game like move mixups tend try trying punish lot time
move also chained various moveset making combo really anticipate
combo ender move guranteed safe punish time need poke risk go combo major example black bear guai final bos chapter generic attack combo combo b
time could use less combo full string combo
typical soulslike
however time would see something like combo combo b
another mixup combo pause combo ender x body slam punish people like poke still dodge reflex fast enough would even combo b pause combo pause throw rarely bos would spam chain attack combo combo b combo ender double hand slam nice see pretty innovative take soulslike fighting style well emphasis bos fight opposed enemy
dark soul issue aside occasional framerate drop one put together open world game expect learning rewarding co op game either co op sure playable boring solo
single player game benefit result empty shell game relies solely player interaction gameplay value
make game designed co op feel empty
soul tradition stay close root exceedingly fun play co op
feel like missing something playing solo anything prefer game ever seen soul series impressed even sticking mechanic open world game
much prop
masterpiece
cool game courage honor
respect gamers
introduction counter strike global offensive multiplayer fps game either part terrorist organisation part team
aim game work together team defeat opposing force
even many new map weapon feature game still classic map gun older counter strike different weapon choose game mode including casual death match arm race competitive skin possible drop end feature new map hacker smurfs ruin competitive general game quite ban may last long c go addictive time lot fun playing friend
graphic nice personally enjoy
communicating working well team huge advantage game prefer stray away rest teammate play rule
rating would
game legit game incredible huge died awesome game sfo mod find quite boring without pricey get dlcs thoughrecommend proper mod great game ruind dumb rule recommend game disappointing feel playing game knowing progress gone couple week play season end good game wo fun play zero every time tick server sub tick feel terrible
see ur opponent see seems like completely different end getting killed around corner getting kill feel like gotten
animation totally broken player strafing leg looking like made jelly even patch said suppose fixed
regarding spray sometimes able mimic able get csgo time end losing track spray bullet go
csgo see missing make correction like far left something
sure visual thing spray something noticed
also see point making whole new game improving anyway
seems really pointless
average fromsoftware enjoyer life honour fate duty fear fear reward salvation craft craft pledge pledge eternal service
ca regained trust whole shadow change literally antagonizing community fiasco wo go detail look game much better spot ca lot work really need bring back release system back warhammer release dlc flc
mean flc mean proper one single hero unit whole faction unique gameplay mechanic like imrik high something right though dlcs currently buy specific dlc faction want force buy whole bundle massive recommend game anyone looking good grand strategy game manage empire turn based system fight battle rts style
game offer many interesting faction play willing pay extra dollar previous game dlcs note even buying warhammer alone literally gain access different faction play kislev faction cathay faction chaos faction mixed chaos faction
opinion give player lot experience sandbox campaign unlocked experience whole total war warhammer game without buy previous still recommend buying game full price though ca trust
conclusion good game bad company buy sale really cool game though frustrating bad even prime
ca recommend game since managed
game really bad management behind outermost respecting fan
""

great shooter experience
personally loving grappling hook ability
charge ridiculous price dlc barely add anything game begin save like one two already part base game considering
smaller company done less
good could recommend writing biomedical engineering senior need pas class semester particularly like game playing convinced get friend could play together
bought less week ago already put hour

actively risking future playing game keep pulling back
could recommend especially newcomer series addition proper tutorial new anti cheat

dropping graphic low
could sheer volume particle
gradually cranked everything back cinematic crashed since
third update sega fired right executive awesome dlc patch fixing many issue
recommend update ca really recommend game moment
ca adopted pretty anti consumer approach fixing core bug poor ai performance campaign level thing broken far long
top increasing dlc price reducing content included
stay away building product customer quarterly previous review immortal empire game built even beta stage seems much care taken new combined campaign standalone
noticed issue previously launch
would recommend review personally issue performance without lag spike soundtrack much better last one series generally great atmosphere
janky stuff recommend waiting immortal empire campaign objective really fun sandbox singleplayer
really cool engine support player multiplayer campaign though awesome addition recommend getting unit randomly told skirmish mode randomly come multiplayer domination unit path settlement properly campaign really fun unless multiplayer
worse warhammer mortal empire quite lot wait immortal fix jank
update positive fix graphic issue wish didnt get suckered pre order dlc
reason forcing wont change even change

bos fight side boss chapter memorable
worst thing chapter
worst thing optimization fps drop considerably come micro stutter start
surely patch later
invisible wall pain ar devs could dealt different recommend want percent game many different item locked behind low rng

ring masterpiece product received free step try fingersstep hole özeti baştan geçeceğim
çok bir umudum olmadan aldığım wukong beni gerçekten çok şaşırttı bu yıl şu ana kadar oynadığım en iyi oyun oynanış olarak zaten sade eğlenceli ama sürekli yeni hareketler büyüler bürünülecek şekiller geliştirmeler buluyoruz yelpazemiz genişliyor
genişledikçe de oyun derinleşiyor
üstüne karşımıza çıkan düşmanın özellikle de bossların farklı mekanikleri bizi sürekli yeni taktikler geliştirmeye zorluyor
oyun çok kolay değil ama sizi cezalandıran bir zorluğu da yok düşmanlarınızı yenebilmeniz için şeyi size veriyor
oldukça hızlı olmanız gereken bir oyun kendine bir ritmi var düşmanına göre değişen
oynanış hep akıcı üst seviye eğlenceli
düşmanların kafasına bütün gücünüzle geçirdiğiniz odunu çok güzel hissettiriyor oyun bize
büyüler eşyalar özelliklerde birden fazla oynamayı hakkedecek kadar başlarda küçük görünse de ilerledikçe dallanıp budaklanıyor genişliyor
harita tasarımları genel olarak güzel bir sürü ufak tefek gizli mekan nesne bos var
kestirmeler gizli haritalarda buna eklenince gayet yeterli bir oyun süresi sunuyor bize dolu zirve yaptığı yer ise sanat yönetmenliği grafikler müzikler karakterlerin diyalogları bölümde türü değişen bölüm arası videolar adımda mest ediyor sizi
fare dövmeye gelmişken bir anda kendinizi kafası olmayan bir ozanın şarkılarına ritm tutarken buluyorsunuz
mekanların büyük kısmı çin deki tapınaklardan direkt aktarılmış veya ilham alınmış hepsi büyüleyici görünüyor
karlı dağlardaki budha heykelleriyle dolu dehlizlerden tutun lavların arasındaki bir tapınağın işlemelerine kadar şey olağan üstü en ufak detaya bile özen journal ise ayrı bir övgüyü hakkediyor
sadece buradaki karakter hikayelerini okuyarak çin mitolojisinin büyük kısmını öğrenebilirsiniz
hikayeler hem eğlenceli hem de yürek dağlıyorlar
sizi sinir eden bir düşmanın gerçek yüzünü öğrenince hafiften dumur da dediğim gibi oyun beni resmen büyüledi nefes almadan oynadım
bir kaç ufak sorunu var belki ama günümüz oyunlarına göre çok komik sorunlar bunlar yüzlerce çalışanı olan multinasyonel firmalar bu kadar stabil oyun yapamıyorlar
bütün içtenliğim ile oyunsevere tavsiye ediyorum hele ki god war tarzı oyunları seviyorsanız
ne yazık ki ülkemizde artık çok pahalı oyunlar hobimizi rahatça tavsiye edemez hale geldik ama bu yıl tane oyun alacaksanız da bu olsun
born year monkey grew island monkey love monkey man since boy best game first let state ive never played dark soul game id heard though never took plunge

first game could choose different mark power armor
weapon still one original game
feel less satisfying game
feel like fun game
like sex better feel like devs bitten chew tw
concept great reality clearly struggling implement thing gone downhill since tw day
urgent fix rolled major patch take month roll instead hotfixes
roadmap took ridiculous amount time released still

getting dlc pack completely new faction used cost
almost feel though ca fed game either putting enough thought price enough effort dlcs
waste
best tactical fps infinite skill ceiling played dark soul dark soul never completed
elden ring first fromsoft game gone far even defeated melania
game fun bos design disrespectfully poorly designed
like utter garbage compare sekiro soul boss
previous game difficult yes fair
felt accomplished overcoming hurdle felt rewarded
elden ring defeat something glad
sad really
boss felt amazing godfrey radahn melania
might sound like hate game love healthy criticize game love
realized feel rng boss feel like many cheese
refused use tool available
beat melania without summon pure dex katana build pride beat without magic
elden ring dark soul boss cheese rng sometimes
use game give level past use summons cracked pot respec mage cheese build etc
resourceful sometimes pure build get boss elden ring
thats okay
impressive game ever played guy love compete game perfect glhf preordered every tw wh game dlc

total b
good stuff ca say game year let goo let preface recommendation game current state recommended enfranchised player warhammer series
time recommend newer player even historical player jot played previous two game
also preface point completed tutorial campaign turn demon prince campaign talk anything beyond spec geforce rtx ramus play curved good game contains number important quality life improvement last game
aside well discussed battle campaign feature solved problem knew know fixed ca clearly learned importance faction mechanically unique
tutorial campaign exceptionally good narrative onboarding seen lot people criticising graphic
graphically game improvement warhammer particularly unit detail effect
made point close look woc unit compare
understand people criticise change visual style campaign map finding overly simplified look
technical issue therefore artistic question
personally prefer style perhaps playing higher resolution screen finding campaign world lot immersive previous game campaign map homogenous per region whereas within one specific region game local area feel lot bad positive qol change sadly thing actually led quality life decrease
particular note unit placement highlight order white snow background seem almost invisible
find extremely surprising addressed release
unit order legibility honestly one important part managing battle sincerely hope something make stand snow common sight issue currently running game try run windowed find top screen cut screen safe space adjustment option choice run full screen
hope issue addressed post stated preface review based small time playing
overall issue faced massively impactful enjoying game immensely
still hope issue addressed soon possible
playing c go almost week say lot fun especially playing round school friend evening always fun
many people like complain bad randoms many hacker smurfs everyone cheater kill one make sense agree certain go team game therefore need good teamplay team please queue friend stop toxic like pig make friend random teammate also possible since time green trust drop time time yellow much writing chat apparently valve filter therefore simply muted x chat abuse report downgraded yellow trust perfect system volvo hardly get cheater also rarely smurfs recommend c go everyone lose many game longer fun help break play premades luck fun rankeds freak much end day also fun
positive review dlc purchased approximate cost game plus dlc previous game dlc
loyalty expensive
lost creative addendum yes game almost dlc
purchased several year loyal consumer
recent practice corporate policy less agreeable made negative review
love game want see thrive want see people play
barrier entry steep get friend join game
paired recent price trending dlc lack content handling staff customer creator leave horribly bitter taste please better
want go back loving game work
want share friend loved one
need meet u recent update game seen improvement
review stand negative simply addressed financial barrier entry newcomer
suggest making bigger pack larger discount bundling different thing
say skaven bundle lizardmen bundle chaos bundle
bundle better price unlock entire faction rather old system lord x faction time
perhaps bundle includes dlc tw another bundle dlc tw including base game faction
make easier want better deal buy bulk getting
one best game played year je recommande surpassed expectation
minor flaw good game nonetheless
much recommended
might first time negative review actually made buy game
open world every game need open fully explorable world
much rather linear experience beautifully crafted environment game
honestly much exploring always worthwhile
map
would never expected actual complaint
game give flashback late early actually play game get direction
use eye recognize still go
make exploration fun worthwhile
backtracking area see missed anything
endless bos rush kill mob next bos sight negative
bos fight reason play genre game
amazed much love attention put bos
gorgeous visuals fun engaging movesets
diversity inclusion
find diversity equality inclusion important topic
however every game need
game good place fit like baldur gate well
however mythological game play monkey beat rat lizard one game last year blast playing
feel like mix god war monster hunter sauce
game hard enough challenging easy enough craft build without googling strong effective build
gear war better okay game one worst chinese game ever release west
game feel shallow
depth anything except million tooltips infinite thing craft make one thing
game truly feel like unfinished mod pubg
play
game feel catered towards chinese market even one chinese friend say get better game
video youve seen telling game awesome sponsored paid devs
lying
immersion
challenge
almost every single area game feel flawed
feel like refundable despite free skaven nuke pretty epic buy mortal empire mode available
campaign engaging portal mechanic meh
preface dark soul bloodborne purist even put many hour software game elden ring
said want go back play dark soul trilogy start finish experience story see play elden ring universe since eluded could ring best rpg played year
game start sharp learning curve unforgiving completely clear direction work game even grace item give clue part portion appeal fascinating evolution game draw
else underlying story character engaging make want continue pushing even patience temper tested throughout
difficulty game overcome trial error also supplemented grinding level learning crafting system strengthen enhance spent long hour software game elden ring learn timing overall strategy must apply every fight game forgive type button mashing punish mistake make fighting enemy could time size character
learn iframes animation prevent taking damage learn longer hold button strong attack likely get hit greater damage potential
learn parrying counter essential play mechanic brute strength way game must apply level finesse frustratingly cruel time amazingly rewarding finally complete mission fell bos played many person rpgs elden ring game wish many actually
specifically indulged entire elder scroll series except first game arena thousand hour series
great evolution series gameplay actually declined course series rather improved even deployment newer technology engine
fact latest installment many way disappointment term play difficulty story telling lack time spent developing npc driving factor
compare elden ring clear software extremely talented staying focused matter developing gameplay story craft universe want part also want continue learning digging said elden ring perfect game definitely room improvement lack cut scene reusing key point game disappointing
game could greatly enhanced adding meaningful cinematics leaving much imagination
definitely pro con approach game caliber would expect complete cinematic element particularly key point game overcome main boss make discovery character come huge surprise develop story path make story
part game find lacking cinematics focus developing story nearly exclusively item description
although fairly unique learn obscure detail fact basically grind item extremely tiny drop rate find complementary tidbit wish way story elaborated upon similar rpgs lore weaved throughout appear item criticism found within game truly enjoyable way play physical ranged character lack ranged weapon tends leave game balance magic melee leaf huge amount content choice character development really pronged choice balancing act narrow way play game
regardless minor eye something could shored sequel make weapon choice slightly dynamic melee magic would say even never played dark soul title bloodborne demonsouls software title want challenging infinitely fun dynamic rpg focus true gameplay story would profoundly recommend elden ring
historical element lore developed help george martin game throne intertwining path character fate amazingly interesting creepy diabolical sad enraging thoughtful yet still left room even emotion depending discover first play
fact choose play main story evolving difficulty desire great complement allows relive ups down expectation without needing start brand new dr best action rpg human generation wo another game come close software team company like bioware integrate dynamic end game experience
game great actualy play real map immortal empire without game draw sand snow
last chapter good others except final bit absence map always felt throughout gameedit game freeze try quit trying quit game right posting review reminded add con pro amazing visualsgreat optimizationgreat combatbreathtaking bossfightsastonishing amount spell skill treesfun interesting charactershuge amount lore lover often given interesting written story dialoguesoverall amazing game exceeded every expectation

overall black myth wukong remarkable achievement game design
stunning visuals challenging combat rich storytelling make fan game
despite technical hiccup steep learning curve game strength far outweigh weakness
looking immersive visually captivating experience black myth wukong definitely worth time dark soul dad quizás un poco caro pero recuerda el emperador proporciona beta since march getting better better update
one popular game doubt
playing total war
every often devs drop ball get little greedy little lazy happens
community reminds money flow move
time feel different
ever since came thing expected
bug less content less transparency higher price
launched sorry state made slightly better long period nobody cared much waiting immortal empire mode would turn total war warhammer trilogy magnum mode came busted
bug balance design far acceptable fun
even devs bad look
took break willing wait polish immortal empire could come back play game
ambitious game thought give time
come back many month later expecting play better game shocked see little improved devs got head time press luck
upcoming shadow change dlc less content cost way usual
gave close year get together trying cash goodwill spent long ago fund hero shooter absolutely dead wallet ca wo pick slack supporting failed endeavor
put people work game talk

fifth playthrough stop playing lol
ever since sekiro looking game challenging satisfying combat experience
elden ring fun combat interactive satisfying sekiro
black myth wukong finally found another game give satisfying combat experience
would even say game actually excels sekiro aspect
love combat aggressive actually beneficial like sekiro
addition fact many spell spirit transformation stance equipment skill available add variety combat experience
many different playstyle build choose change build time
even fifth playthrough still discovering new way play game
favorite thing switch stance counter different varied combo satisfying pulling
top move variety two boss every fight incredibly cinematic
people looking start game would recommend starting one
game much forgiving easy get compared actual soul game
lose anything death refund respec skill point time want much stronger dodge enables dodging last second get hit farm level trouble bos
besides lenient game also polished every aspect
definitely life overwhelmingly positive reputation
long story short soul like gameplay like buy right discus entitlement earn playing game

basically paying half game asking fork money
dumb business model ai dumb hammer stuff thats breaking game ago still break
grapple toxic player community deficient system encountering cheater every three match shortage casual game mode absence rate implementation questionable system called subtick
additionally game plagued peeker advantage ultimately overshadowing somewhat brighter note game boast nice graphic though seems people flock visual conclusion drawback including problematic player base ineffective measure cheater prevalence limited game mode tick rate issue peeker disadvantage cast shadow standout gaming experience

kinda enjoyed c go like forced update game newer version less
especially private game friend
give game negative review
inferior version already mid game
almost hour quality experience single playtrough talk getting money really add covenant
let start saying game good
buy game likely enjoy first campaign enjoyed first vortex campaign game
added bunch qol improvement change find negative review due thing legitimate like bug lack replayability comparison brand new game masterpiece second game trilogy
felt need leave review give greater context negative review
people comparing brand new game game year tweak dlc flesh greatest potential
game brand new dlc day bonus mortal empire fresh bug etc
bit unfair compared game launch game peak
game launch mortal empire fraction playable available
time game likely surpass popularity take time devs add immortal empire sandbox mode new patch bug
think game best release day dlc update currently superior product unless played death bored playing warhammer game rarely ever go sale would suggest picking enjoying campaign two get bored put come new update especially immortal empire update coming later year
add bunch replayability currently lot people dislike soul race feel like installing mod remove objective game
current faction already offer bunch differing campaign mechanic keep thing fresh personally mileage may vary
game get two thumb know get better time like first second game fun released day
liked mortal empire immortal empire everything would wanted
im turn thorgrim campaign typing
still balancing minor fixing required overall game feel great far crashed ironically pressed exit desktop im confident run better rift campaign absolutely amazing
want race get update becouse especially dwarf empire got hit nerfs range unit mechanic outdated comparing race game feature vast open world called land filled diverse landscape hidden secret challenging enemy

even step back community vocal siege already weak part game made complex attempt make fun
larger immortal empire map size new faction great warhammer whole new game whole new game feel like warhammer major content mod
try finger hole gf asked choose c go told suka blqt idi nahui
good first time played really dedicated since game popping became game popular still play fun practice aim surf plugin type gametypes community server behold issue ahead tarnished one
human promised immersive experience setting unfortunately fails deliver many front
game visuals lackluster lack polish one would expect title
environment feel generic making exploration feel like chore mechanic clunky unrefined
combat often feel unresponsive hit detection issue lead frustrating encounter
crafting system could added depth feel overly complicated plagued repetitive resource gathering quickly becomes frustrating aspect reset mechanic
arbitrary timer disrupts progression also feel like forced attempt keep player engaged
instead fostering sense achievement creates anxiety resentment player feel pressured grind content reset hit
design choice detracts significantly overall experience making hard invest time effort story another major letdown
could intriguing narrative bogged uninspired writing poorly developed character
dialogue feel forced making hard connect plot care outcome element seem tacked rather integrated smoothly game leading disjointed experience lack cohesion
matchmaking frustratingly slow coordination teammate hassle due poor communication human missed opportunity fall short expectation
game feel like slog engaging experience leaving player longing polished innovative approach genre
tos requires id stuff county law requires share request law enforcement
immortal empire launch trailer earned vote
emperor must buy brother
really would like switch review positive future game really good
unfortunatelly friend character glitched support discord support could help
keep repeating copypaste answer
lost progress
game good hope never need support
solved keep review negative
лучшая игра года надеялся получить хотя бы неплохой солслайк в итоге игра по всем фронтам обскакала игры фромов
тупо из based monke difficulty challenge heat confrontation treat opponent graphic m graphic matter good nothing special original artistic story game basic element contractual people want well leading model get inspired length long enough cup infinity music filling trivial good fitting game artistic transcending whisper forgotten interest would rather watch paint hard repetitive good sticking remember long replayability wait mod infinitely replayable almost bug never heard minor get impact player game big terrarium requirement run high nasa price perfect could complete waste worth buying nothing else wait yes first time really leaving review feel like need
everyone review bombing game known bug going fixed able switch server
people patience least give game chance
greedy asf quite frankly best open world ever played play long
really game perfected open world sense open
force tell anything throw world little direction wonderment curiosity player take reign
similar botw outstanding world packed brim fun unique encounter around quite literally every corner
always something new end line sight amazing power draw player
amount content varied soft able fit talked year game without downside though albeit minor
performance pc terrible remained week took play
excuse point framerates locked
game also better worse tell much welcome change make discovery feel better needed kind codex player remember plethora plotlines
world huge next time return plotline end forgetting
lastly balance game something soft absolute master previous entry beyond broken point bit frustrating
fought margit completely underpowered favored main story point explored world tackling main story portion area found boss dropping like fly
need work kind scaling system continue open world
reason hand even close easiest soul game date post margit fantastic entry series also deserves nod world created grrm
unique cool whole slew interesting well designed character
definitely game see high many top game list easy recommendation anyone especially due low level difficulty
elden ring cured depression doesnt deserve negative review gamers review bomb anything easy pathetic another game fun believe die within release quite amalgamation theme genre
setting feel similar game like control scp gameplay seems borrow game like rust loop simple loot tier area create tier building gear fight bos unlock tier
loot tier area create tier building gear fight bos unlock tier tier area create tier building gear fight bos unlock tier fine fun gameplay loop big issue currently
enemy ai great reckless seldom punished

also saw pvp server netcode great even pve setting
friend always claim thing match person saw often see eachother teleporting animation phasing building floor bizarre way
corrupted savefile
class reset lvl sort review stay negative never ever paid dollar currency game regret
worth every penny every percentage hype past year since teaser

slight flaw nothing major game breaking
bug little bit balancing would fix
would definitely never download heretical helldivers ever bombshell game dropped
time alive fellow brothersnow onwards emperor
month still blood dlc job one best gen game played till date
worth wait game
courage honor brother
testosterone approved masterful successor original provides fantastic experience would recommend fan whether casual seriousness
complaint later part game tend seriously amount ranged dp get thrown way insane take away amazing melee combat game offer
yes
finally collected thousand warhammers truly horus heresy
""
told maidenless multiple occasion extremely poor relationship advice time change review forgot let honest maybe change game released realm chaos immortal throne forever boggle singleplayer storymodes waste developer time general
know people played teh way hold opinion asked
immortal empire warhammer iii sadly immortal empire come customizations
get map billion choice always
want randomness life need look age wonder civilization
total warhammer great game hit game always exact map exact setup exact prejudice situation
start playing world take life yes
launch screen sure
like tsukihime fr bought game kill furry people dark soul breath wild treatment
material craftingmounted explorationopen world explorationrandom weapon armor dropsbeautiful scenerylots secretsjolly botw weapon breaking system good game good game bad communication edit originally negative review due performance issue glitch since patchedelden ring fantastic culmination fromsofts design lesson dark soul
personal hiccup undeniably fantastic first attempt making dark soul open world game crazy well executed
term open world might make wince bit seeing game open world mean made big empty map nothing filled objective marker pretend content
might also concern dark soul formula tightly designed challenge area would function world meant freely explored pace
honestly say found good way mixing together
world may open youll come across castle cavern tightly designed like area old title shortcut bonfire boss end without loading screen obvious level transition
game simply force horse us clever level design prevent major skip happening get tight level design youre familiar
combat better ever us many lesson learned previous title also mixing brand new one give fresh still familiar dark soul feel
story usual vague feel put bit effort try convey whats happening previous game although likely youll still need look video end journey really understand went could go game well review would turn wordy easier say didnt enjoy allow come conclusion negative enough push away trying title
keep mind negative mentioned dont outweigh sheer amount positive game
main story path actively scaled curve insanely hard first bos get find struggling super hard start questioning thing right
game designed way encourage leave bos alone explore instead get new etc clear playing meant
""
game boast impressive boss worth noting massive amount end regular enemy beefed hp damage
mention ton repeat bos slightly different
nature open world mean entirely possible arguably unavoidable youll end completely overpowered robs fun fight lot case
luckily main boss needed main campaign dont really issue scaled quite well progress
multiplayer pain butt use
youre playing friend prepare grind ton flower pedal youre required use one every single time die want friend also open world invasion arguably annoying game
area incredibly large uncommon get invaded spend minute trying find hiding pvp invasion limited small area entirely possible invaded open world
literally turn hour long hide seek session annoying fun could combat better disconnect friend deal whole thing
people taken modding better multiplayer fix
none bother much bought game already
bought game chicken disappointed
exploring countless land chicken traveled far wide realized population growing large
chicken started inhabit horrid location across world nuclear plant office without cafeteria
knew done
bought flip knife steam market called peta
listened arm angel microsoft professional deluxe gaming chair twelve hour response decided take matter hand
loaded started put chicken misery
cried harder night ever
next morning tear eye loaded global chicken saw new item waiting inventory
flip knife turned flip knife slaughter
moment realized horrible thing done
hand shaking navigated mouse uninstalled global chicken
regret everything done
writing review warn chicken let know made full recovery started new journey goat simulator
thank farewell
pricey game little innovation
actually game great gameplay fps dynamic
however among game played far game worst community make unbearable
pet cat
perfect long year waiting find whatever happened titus end space marine day finally
people think single player campaign little short fell right goldilocks zone right story worth pacing good
tyranid swarm insanely frenzied near dealing thousand son tzaangor cultist ally tends methodical go along like expect breeze individually dangerous number still weapon take single
opposition scale even best weapon start feel like tickling opponent
naturally significantly tougher biggest best gun melee weapon knocking sliver health time headshot heaviest blow little disheartening
campaign something deal multiplayer level gear unlock various class perk win victory becomes less burden
two mode operation eternal war pve pvp respectively
eternal war definitely fun challenging honest enjoy playing two others operation little feeling purpose go along achieve mission beautiful game
geforce running maxed problem worried grandson pc slightly minimum spec
happily also running surprisingly well lower setting still look absolutely gripe aforementioned problem weapon feeling task bossier enemy clive standen taking mark strong voice titus
strong voice iconic long standen made well short order
soul game infinity stone gauntlet
review written hour pure khorne goodness
far seen bug real note
one crash far unusual total war game
say khorne feel op though spawning army ability raze city
thematic get wrong wow
rolled entire faction matter turn
eats coffer properly built economy support endeavor pretty fun hunting demon prince blast opinion
really looking forward mortal empire immortal empire new gameplay addition
like game story good
work quite well possible sequel original journey west overall graphic design character aesthetic related material actually quite good like even low graphic setting pretty solid gear ability get mat bad
take time explore
able mostly craft decent amount armor set near end game
think able create least set ng
combat shabby either see change see change one biggest thing recognized almost immediately lack map map would helpful exploring huge map area
especially since chapter quite long
personally would preferred leveling increased attack defense maybe every level maybe every level two least
boss much damage
someone like bit slow brain take time adjust attack timing would really helped alot
combat think part like mentioned bad
light attack dodging heavy attack usual
experienced least sometimes game respond command pressed hotkey exaggerating like bazillion time
like space bar dodge
boss lock would randomly disappear
boss fly high sky something
like would regular combat ground
whether bug pc know
experiencing
mana regen mechanic poor restore rate using gourd
lowkey ruin game spec cpu intel gpu nvidia geforce rtx founder edition ram corsair vengeance stupid price new dlc
one best competitive fps game
need lot practice patience learn build skill
need good aim game sense patience along regular practice want get better
master game fps game piece cake
weapon different recoil pattern rof way handle need learn order get bad side community toxic ranked matchmaking bad hacker
good game
vehivle
whats vehivlegood game im early setting guy vehicle v vehivle camera bit screen tearing major bug yet space marine good example lost due game service predatory monetization scheme videogames whose sole purpose development serve cosmetic skin virtual transported back first decade video game art pure entertainment

interrupted spell going cd hit casting annoying esp long animation long monkey see monkey oo oo ah ah portal ruin game replayability make game slow immortal empire thing ok
want give good review know fact im gon na switch later id hold game bit
main gamemode going really neat first like added story kinda mortal empire anything
basically stay little area chaos rift open attack settlement constantly playing defensive isnt really fun
plus like like take age build base build really op army time get faction win game
cant continue anything
thats lose boot lol
yeah hopefully mortal empire added soon enjoyable
product received free update made game supererer funnnnnn
prepare fun tried still stand review absolute
performance garbage salvaging travesty absolute f game
l company
ca fix performance piece game man
still fix campaign map stutter
amended initial review say ok best masterpiece people say clearly blinded fanboy devotion
personally play casually maybe delve campaign hour kill time morbid reminiscence could contrast hour month release
negative quite obvious
bad performance stuttering fix sight really
wo fix shill start accepting fps good enough performance
worse settlement battle predecessor still opinion superior total war game
worse siege predecessor instead improving capture point game turn inevitable slog siege total war warhammer series even annoying endeavour
worse performance high resolution apparent reason get fps campaign map smooth around ca keep making abritrary dumb change campaign really needed mad scramble rectify absolute sorry state game less land battle
still adundant visual glitch map lighting obviously ie released map look perfect least gave try first blackfire pas toned weird blue filter example
better dlc lord one pack good idea advocated long time ago better unit texture
guess
kislev look terrible
better vassal diplomacy
say stick really want enjoy good warhammer total war experience game feel flat soulless consistently like since release even ie beta
final note ca fix performance cause kill experience settlement battle improved fact flat garbage everyone know even total war warhammer game way work stand buff unit capturing point multiple capture point pasted every settlement battle siege stupidity really need bunch modders change rectify
dunno say continuously start new campaign play turn start anew
hour gone faction bored
also drunk part sol imperialis awesome start tutorial call see dude finally f cking beat dude longer would recommend one overrated game played combat part good also basic game many problem invisible wall bad level design especially chapter chapter pretty good though boss others bad design get game sale
terrible incomplete mess launch game last year slowly starting build back leap back price hike dlc terrible value growing disconnect audience half expecting mobile game day
soooo goood
minute game everyone already told jump cliff warning game take soul fist born start itpositiv thing say csgo meet people around learn abusive word fun whole family meet age opening case get skin server fun everybodynegativ thing one mention toxic people skin lead empty using toaster still many russian abuse speaking playing gold elo harder playing mg hour c invest string prepared emergenciesview playing c girl always fun abusive kid kid trying flirt comment like girl play woman right go kitchen yes mommy proud best comment russian kid go play cooking simulator well friendly bright spot friendly sorry guy flaming thanks make mm bearable would recommend
hacker every game valve doesnt care game terrible state almost everyone cheat installed start cheating lose
like skyrim gun worse current build better release release
sure awesome mortal campaign added improvement mechanic diplomacy especially save soooo much useful recruit allied unit coordinate fun trade settlement demon campaign mechanic actually pretty powerful feel soundtrack animation landscape battle location except walled city issue map like altdorf still missing poor end game reward without spoiler underwhelming come
reward everyone narrative reward granted cutscenes get new trait ability beat campaign fun never ending chaos invasion every turn forever
requires hero stationed every entry point ready close portal gold every turn
want take map get ready shell ten thousand gold every turn bump hero realm chaos give little reward
really go slaanesh penthouse get fancy trinket rest trash leaving bad mortal empire city hurt dont get
currently try dock archer wall whatever line sight often blocked sit set archer behind wall somewhere shoot wall settlement place two capture point instead setting force top objective defending split force
worth unit garrisoning town defend two capture point losing one loses battle
fight strees wall
صدج عجيب game seems healthier state right dark soul scholar second sin stopped playing cod began playing c rank real motivation balanced skill based interactive huge tactical gameplay instead fast learning process every improvement feel like small success absolutely loving game people stuttering issue day one patch screwing thing unfortunate fromsoft aware fix within week said plagued thesis issue far best soul game ive played im hour time righting atmosphere amazing combat fast deliberate
personally could happier know going quickly eat life
im hour seen roughly enemy type including boss killed first bos explored first map area

seen creative assembly understand mistake
player compensated soc content new standard
despite clear response community campaign new lord tzeentch boring bad plan anything
least problem game serious problem bug ogre mechanically broken every aspect playing even banned tournament
many legendary lord faction suffer long list bug addressed way since launch
finally got chaos reworked norsca still buggy boring
almost year game still bugged point every single person encounter least bug every campaign
even care something realm chaos yet many player compained boring since easily repell chaos invasion without much effort
fix game ca dlc issue btw imo new content still worth
need least faction reworked per dlc
monke game easily change life forever
well greed killed csgo csgo ocean go rank drown speds scrub
eventually go past point return simply return surface forced suffocate beneath wave dragged anchor asphyxiate high pitched shriek rego server
best monkey king game far
many boss love
close perfection get
spell binder definitely bit strong though
ca need better
care less less fan every game pocket book
dont listen dont update dont care
better
buy play warhammer ii ca get stuff together
look bright side money buy something better
absolutely loved game
played fan art regular discord planned build one monster halloween quitting absolutely recommending reason
mostly played launcher hour reflect time played
got beta main character since release hundred hour play two
good follows
monster world design great combat fun map fantastic exploring spent whole night even getting bike get going sheer joy driving
game loop quite addictive till start hitting friction point thinking looming demise hard work
company wields fomo like finely honed sword
coupled short season item generates feeling rushed even though know several week feel like get everything done time would end start many way familiar keep season
might huge problem many gamers want clear area collect formula item put base feel like actually accomplished top time limit actually getting formula grindy see anyone could get without lucky game every waking moment
issue building system buggy limited
aesthetic hit miss mostly miss ca really customize cosmetic house item choose ugly ugli
build piece modern aesthetic enjoy attempt queen anne house end looking like mcmansion
hard justify spending lot cash shop roof corner place love money even though previously dissapearing randomly piano roof
absurd problem require absurd solution
another glaring issue character progression
lot ability crafting upgrading maintaining base equipment behind rng appalingly limited opportunity reset anything
incredibly frustrating bad luck getting critical ability like able make acid sulfur get good one reset next season
maybe encouraging people work group everyone mechanic make game unfriendly solo
economy also frustrating
central global way trade
vending machine sell local territory truck later game place somewhere hope people interact
relegated old day spamming chat try sell hoping someone come vending machine forced ridiculously low buying cap vendor game impossible actually level ability rng cost money well point
also need money teleport buy expensive formluas vendor thing cost
many currency many menu buried within menu easy forget something lose track button click get measly reward get completing season goal daily whatever
chore navigate nested game lot glaring instance obviously unfinished
missing translation odd animation mismatched dialog
question going provide new content every week perpetuity seems promised starting scenerio hate break human
pretty big emotional time investment limited financial one
really could game many problem many choice cause player frustration ca spend free time anymore knowing month
done
ca bad старая добрая контра
disappointing say least
story meh
combat super meh
graphic bad
weapon beyond boring
enemy supremely basic
post non existent
mobile game best
honestly thought finished first real mission turn entire campaign
spoiler alert
final bos fight might basic uninteresting gaming experience life

amazing game terrible game hour game admit
love meh counter strike need improve anti cheat doom eternal meet gow meet
one hell combination year waited sequel oh brother let tell disapoint expensive dlcs con easy cheat undetectable vac dont see solution coming skin pure gamble fix way stop harming family behavior
game getting better money anyway geting old nothing new took year balance pistol toxic community agrravated cheater trying legit using monitor running fps playing like skill level meaning due massive cheating
eagle without cheating global negative cheating proven valve banning account free play play game ever sold skin uds never support game without good anticheating free game paid cheater
huge build variety plenty weapon skill world reward exploration lot hidden combat expected soul game whatsoever
long cutscenes inventory weight worry long animation simple stuff qtes
pure unadultered replayability common game thanks progression build variety pvp recommended
well least friend able play chernobyl nuclear disaster aftermath less toxicity game
edit recent update certainly step right direction
bias reduced lot big issue replenishment improved faction
whoever managing project seem community
keep negative still finally improving way people game fixed launch issue
lay around waiting ambush annoying moment overall far better game
leaving review personally exhausted total war game coming horrific balance would like serve reminder
game came state would big thumb start
fact ready
fact doubled thing people hated game
freakishly slow update get basic issue fixed
fact warhammer game need almost entire year get blood added
warhammer game play blood god
fact main campaign absolute miserable experience
much
start main positive could give faction much engaging mechanic earlier game
even roster miserably small trying say something nice
ogre feel actually finished roster interesting mechanic wide variety bad well difficult explain extremely bad thing character limit short
could write multiple page design flaw main campaign
flaw ranging complex issue difficult deal amateur design choice imagine get thrown first time slip anyone lip let alone added aaa campaign effectively race get triggered every turn
unfortunately absolutely kill pacing base total war gameplay
everything come halt enter chaos realm get soul first
realiize one playing game
ai playing game
challenge get debuffs complete puzzle need building recruit unit need actually anything
automatically breeze suffer miserable experience endless debuffs attacked enemy main army pocket dimension
game actively punishes playing game intended
expanding settlement empire mean ai disproportionately focus
allowing home burned reaction sending army doorstep
maybe get ally
could useful game design make ai alliance suddenly become passive weak faction
yes alliance ai actually get ai debuffed anything
ai obviously ai due comical level player targeting bias
shamelessly anything stop nothing else entire game
issue bad even developer admit need fixing
keep mind added bug intended game mess everything put hold
month dedicated fix horrific design choice baked deep game
also month needed fix replenishment faction
going
take month fix thing modders fixed within hour mod coming give year little might launchable state
sadly could good ca decided ignore feedback stick whatever wanted
let hope change fast
way many hour total war game totaling probably hour warhammer game alone
brother
game month got dlcs cart crazy
point stop development game start dlc remember launch realm chaos f cking trash unenjoyable buy fix broken race reduce outrageous dlc cost
game okay dlc one race
also look troy wan na even disgusted creative assembly
pure frustration often get find chore around house
least half play time afk dish loading washer dryer
house spotless
thanks elden ring
ultrawide support
""
fun good game stutter issue nothing demotivating fighting strong enemy bos almost defeated get stutter die cant react however played total hour amazing game soon fix optimizing world filled lot stuff fell empty greedy dlc price game buggy mess long release
getting way many fun hour playtime one leave positive review overall experience even disagree decision made devs
thankfully mostly fixed mod really amazing one
hacker everywhere
fun concept
enjoyed tutorial simple fact play friend stuck different server nothing working get u together server quickly losing interest
want play friend ca
game great issue ruining experience operation row lost connection oh want continue offline nevermind back hangar let continue
dont normally review ca impressing change attitude
shadow new update revived opinion game development team bought every dlc since hour game less impressive dlc soc release worst far
run poorly sometimes especially campaign still incredible game brings series together
long maintain new ideology instead buy kill game mentality game prosper
counter strike go came good online server quite year update game become really good
knew valve team behind c would let c fan
counter strike go offer different gamemodes improved graphic overall option ranking system interested good variety map weapon
competitive scene grown think thats great
unlike fps c requires skill training
game came could customize weapon much thats possible thousand badass looking skin stuff
c go really cheap compared competitor im recommending without doubt
really cool game though frustrating bad even prime
disappointingedit sep wow thought could change review later look like ca fixed issue game
disappointing spent way much money game
perfect game play game fullest need game full game ask money dlcs base game warhammer broken garbage give money
hard put word joy elden ring brought
rarely see game explore fight way huge fantasy world many functional build play much explore much see stuff find actually matter improvement character unique underground hidden area expertly blend grand sense adventure discovery open world tighter focused exploration large type area blended seamlessly surrounding world also feel like experience traditionally dark soul like lot way
see mean get stormveil castle first time see feel gameplay shift something veteran soul series feel home also think good job making game little accessible player found similar game difficult still offering challenge
particularly like world allows alternative trying push forward difficulty
simple matter abandon area bos giving trouble trying luck elsewhere maybe go stats find charge flask improve weapon find better gear obtain new magic learn craft helpful item also hone ability player practice without frustration come back impossible bos wo seem hard love game
one thing check box encourage anyone curious try especially since already patching game try relieve trouble pc player launch count lucky problem
seen stream issue look like understand frustration experiencing weird yop tvaju matyesuka yobanadaj drop idi nahuirush b shad deh ap bish idi nahui ti uze zajebalblyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaattttcs go great russian ce jeu si vous prenez option russe pour votre game teached waste endless amount money speak hate cry
monkey love game much one greatest experience ever
headless banjo player goat time like called monkey skinned vermintide gave crohn disease want kiss dad many damn cheater
wait decide actually fix game
yes
first good soul game sometimes hard stay focussed get frustrated
play performance suck open world
difference play low ultra frame drop appeare legacy dungeon open areals performance fine
fix plus widescreen support would highly game roamed open world found place friendly character scary enemy
longer played better got explore taking bon fire placement additional option made huge step quality live take run without beat half game slay demi god way
already experienced dark soul feeling place far away forced stuck
fight feel good soul game therefore ignore fighting knight skeleton crab
chapeau let real second game without dlc predecessor even half total war game price asked pay full experience stomachable bought stuff want last balancing place since ca ramped magic ii iii considerably throw elite unit like going style met half dead chaos army still kick as every single unit super elite unit know mean
difficulty setting essentially beef ai unit ridiculous level reduces upkeep faction tenth size may field many army legendary lord may special special effect minor economy buff meet one battle prepared nasty surprise
even hard difficulty seen ai attacking getting killed last zombie sylvania attacking army back full strength lord put ground may scenario follow old throw ton elite fullstacks player fun
idk actual horde attack spawning example stack elite wood elf go rampage burn stupid forest plainly creativly design minor village moronic extreme mostly benefit defender nearly much case dwarf human elf may thing like firing lane defensive position mind
often court might concentrate enemy blocking exit ca put ranged unit good firing position around
siege still stupid twwhi
everybody ladder arse wall little death trap troop
knocking reenforced gate club fist take much time take unit leave saying fun game could much better especially since third final entry series
liked two twwhs dlc race might want play go ahead buy new whole twwh go get something else game annoy hell outta
product refunded sure hype game
best game bought year ago
worst clunky mess thats repetitive mundane
want horde game go wwz helldivers
pop hard nice game campaign short still great think room improvement companion ai tho
matchmaking good feel like need feature less loading screen hopefully improve incoming update
anyways banger without doubt
emperor protects
game science first aaa game hella impressive knew nothing wukong except monkey king warframe immediately got interested mythology wont lie may find quick explanation story journey west tube learn
absolutely mind blowing great visuals action mostly due crash ive experiencing get fixed overtime know whats going game know lot phew phew phew going year still get black screen bug tutorial
game polished enough price even tho good game much content
hope game get ea treatment become killed golden goose mention absurd price dlcs
mean come one faction cost discount
smoking astrologer pack poor game fun gameplay mechanic new siege gameplay feel total tower getting auto build every second rebuild tower wall also take building require unit build
everything attacker get full rush capture supply sector real siege battle
magic spell strong point magic attack decimate solder single hit wizard legendary lord even lord hero
get kill level wizard ability
center mass unit older total war aiming musket target right unit would rotate depending soldier middle squad would rotate depending solider front squad making absolute control
mechanic seems effective right unit counter another lethality high burst musket fire pike infantry atleast hp gone problem progression system current progression system otherwise great game going drive would player away sticking game evolves course road map separate cosmetic class progression single currency requisition required progress category put player position going make mistake try kit preferred astarte chapter
player search correct right shoulder insignia company pauldron trim paint mean sacrificing progression class skill
explanation risk new player system frustrating easy level class able afford even first row perk
class skill unlock appropriate level
need also buy requisition
amount requisition victory increased difficulty level
still receive reduced amount requisition mission failure
continue require victory progress unlocking distinct armor part
weapon progression simply bad approach weapon system convoluted tying better weapon behind higher difficulty guaranteed way drive player away frustration
minimal difficulty game hard recommending level player take next difficulty tier meaningless spent requisition cosmetic instead class skill
mastery token simply removed game
progress experience weapon class perk also unlock without acquire mastery token
locking armory data required advance weapon class higher tier bad formula
player never able achieve weapon data tier remain stuck lower difficulty without mean improve offensive ability beyond point
armory data need exchange system green exchange purple
system also need far better game tool tutorial without everyone refer date early access review information reddit post trying figure work potential also potential die fast game going draw lot attention fully launch
people excited playing space marine
even suggested change game going grind progress
player find progress also heavily skill gated seriously difficult game move next thing
important preserve high difficulty player skill want challenge
equally important perk equipment necessary play higher difficulty become available player lower skill system involved retooled quickly game end small player base nothing hardcore difficulty seeker
entire backbone otherwise great game progression system total miss hope take constructive criticism improve game sustain audience still opportunity recommend game progression system economy multiplayer addressed full price asking point
great game
insane

great blend exploration skillful combat freedom level design rpg nerding immersion itemization storytelling
open world comprised mindful intentional design creating sense pacing within fully exploration experience
never seems end think game played card start slowing delivers
main dungeon experience behold often giant towering structure work way towards feat level art design
character building possibility awesome game reward experimentation critical analysis build way soul game never quite nailed
gameplay loop varied addicting equal part exploration analysis experimentation engaging responsive combat
huge high budget immersive world rpg put game design gameplay mechanic first intriguing story never get way compromise difficulty
control movement responsive thanks sekiro animation good art vfx real interest excitement discovering game world mechanic owe play game blindly minimal outside influence game support blind play well though worthwhile take basic note journal notepad file

summon maiden keep company crucible knightcrucible knightcrucible knightcrucible knightcrucible knightcrucible knightcrucible knightcrucible knightcrucible knightcrucible knight weak affr fr know hitting girl thing going really well conversation slide fact boyfriend die little bit inside
game feel like
awful company policy
great game like fighting ton unique boss
story bit hard follow without familiar source material still enough get handle end
really enjoyed recommend people put challenging game hold hand
permanently reshape way think game
nothing quite like enjoy pace savor every fight every beautifully choreographed move breathtaking landscape
kinda game take life play think elden ring
bought new pc dlc dope got cool big sword one game need meh middle option
campaign mediocre individual mission encounter feel kinda lazy outdated design extremely repetetive
enemy ai extremly basic enemy attack boss maybe
dialogue kinda lazy basic even cliche standard
environment kinda enough
like tiny step generic sci fi coridor shooter
enemy bullet spongy hell
combat seems take inspiration dark soul like literally everything day doesnt work tyranids enemy
veteran game say intended difficulty one hit take hp take like hit kill basic enemy hit
trash mob swarming stunning
grindy tiring feel like even beat every encounter
kinda like dark soul
ranged enemy swarm seem target player
companion ai atrociously dumb game seems designed purelly around coop
enemy hp etc
control feel unresponsive wierd delay thing
especially bad melee result feel really bad
ai straight bug place effectivelly literally nothing lot different gun slightly different name feel almost identical sound sm walking instead tank barbies slipers
gun sound meh narative driven sp game designed entirelly around coop mp even campaign
""
seriously
whoever keep putting hold button action video game need publicly excecuted warning next generation
doesnt even belong console game thing since motion blur pc game
visuals good shooting mostly satisfying despite meh gun sound space marine fighting xenos voice acting reasonably good
minor issue stuttering fairly rare
ultrawide support yet designed purely multiplayer nobody play single player mediocre
great
skull skull throne blood blood god
good game im deeply upset see way
decided manage property late trilogy
time filled fantastic content much needed maintenance made game continually fun return month year
however
seemed change course
game littered crippling bug ai combat lord made many aspect significantly less fun previous title
alone would kill interest variety potential content always renewed interest game fallen disarray pricing change
announcement new pricing structure content would previously range expectation standard going alone wouldnt kill interest game price change matched higher quality consistent bug fix like duration would accepting
together though two problem create game neither fun good value mind sadly say individual seeking get wh game get steep discount avoid completely
play warhammer
currently hot garbage
total hour poured hour mention thousand hour across total war game disheartening witness feel like ca decline
game fun yet direction ca taking left deeply disappointed
pricing strategy dlcs beyond comprehension
despite consistent support purchasing dlcs upon release recent two dlcs priced astonishing
honesty evaluating content offer pricing appears worthy thought spending two dlcs perplexing
would consider buying baldur gate instead
repeated assurance new dlc introduce entirely fresh journey led maintain faith development team
however becoming evident ca care player
insatiable greed devouring vibrant creativity
shadow change last dlc unless substantial improvement truly disheartening
believed ca aimed craft gaming experience would treasured journey etched player memory
yet seems pursuit profit overshadowed want make money
thats fine get
making money
instead instead guy gradually morphing another blizzard
shame
best soul game combinated open worldranni kinda lovelyone exciting thing jump
average iq c community c
remembered friend
well warhammer point buying game unless want take advantage player multiplayer campaign
game selling point
blood gore dlc blood gore
unit animation seem even clunkier
overall game terrible
run great graphical advancement whatsoever
also actual unit size
ultra men unit tier unit
ultra
even
epic scale battle sir
epic scale see joke
medieval total war make mockery unit scale let alone modded version game
game came
decade unit size worse
joke
seeming bug always occur occurs half time single entity unit mostly commander stop fighting stand getting wailed matter many time click disengage card abysmal devoid soul always
else expect ca
gave making quality total war decade ago
always
release half as maybe update game community mad enough every month first year release lackluster already warhammer support company
game year awhile since played game hooked point could stop playing
combat fluid environment beautiful levelling system fun explore unlocking new gear make look badass also help along journey
combat fun
well get capture soul monster defeated use skill also transform boss defeated get pick fighting stance suit playstyle
stance changed fly combat
get magic spell top
anyone telling combat boring know talking game
element enemy respawn huge bos battle
ever feel put game difficult worry say game challenging best practice perfect dodge
game year
start music game amazing combat story telling hit right keynote crescendo moment
watching end chapter cutscene listening song really fit perfectly cord vocal play scene
music amazing art direction
different style art every cutscene fantastic choice
draw much attention
like end chapter cutscene foreshadows side mission game well done game science
favourite side mission
would think fighting boss boss would get tiresome black myth manages make game bos fight feel fascinating fun
many time play game reskin bos battle attack previous level black myth
bos fight unique attack feel fresh see video game
bos battle exciting monster design look interesting
fun reading monster encyclopaedia book
better win award music art direction
controversyfollowing black myth wukong beginning frustrating see unfairly treated game gotten journalist gaming journalist even content creator matter
smart enough know whole controversy obvious become piece dot together
dei asks money said company make dei friend slander game science cough ign every news outlet spread like wildfire gaming medium reviewer purposely give game low score top clearly show never played beyond chapter
dei black myth wukong would truly break art game
art asian culture essence rich history
wrong include dei principle game based journey west classic chinese novel cultural authenticity historical context deeply rooted chinese culture also respect artistic vision
game science wanted game told
story culture outside influence right tell
game started passion
also frustrating see content creator turning blind eye black myth either mention coverage downplaying game mention broken record sold x amount copy made x amount million
shamefully even easy ally even cover game hyped concord lol
game game year
lot yet despite sad say get snubbed gaming award know rigged
ca wait dlc smash record come
hail monkeyking ca f ck malenia neither game workshop game always going forbiddingly expensive like game eg blood bowl darktide gotten pretty silly quality quantity content keep going price keep going
every dlc previous game plan buying current one unless generous sale feel obligated negatively review ca recommend game anyone
best mechanic gameplay hey hey hey dont say anyhting give back money labor love dope game year first time play soul game omg bad loved
recommend game trash scottish dawi shotgun originally positive thought game found take everything season end mean take everything matter
thing get keep journey completion think sure one blueprint character cosmetic formula house cosmetic mistaken memetic portion knew remembered create also get keep house starchrom star source mitsukos mark sproutlet planula oh friend made stuck around
may let keep stuff well since job family stuff get keep probably something time obtain even educate within game
game pretty lot content real life work priority never able get done week
server reset forced tag along fall new server starting scratch
mean pretty much playing game beginning oh fun
game end middle progression matter since progression hard work many hour spent taken haha creator
get new world explore get enemy mission npc everything different mission know maybe since complete first part lol
treat like stupid making complete task could ever forget create base least give u done effin already let skip
yet wipe motivation even play
wipe make sense pvp pve fact lose level map progression mmo extremely stupid
week enough time lot u job family ca live human hour day
yes obligation real life job sure go able play complete within week f k
honestly think worth since really getting anything new time put grind
final outlook game mindset mmos hard keep let really give anything new give enough time complete world take forced spend time forced task giving new content often
since play mmos one thing seem struggle upkeep engaging content keep majority player base perhaps attempt keeping fresh
disappointed hoping finally came across good mistake hopefully make change maybe separate pve pvp player achieve battle pas content create pvp character grind battle pas content still freedom play game pve normal grind battle pas content
thought hope consider
ca decided year hyping warhammer cherry top would complete experience game throw away chance squeeze last dime threaten hold hostage
like think scummy bad make excuse rising development cost entirely forgetting free marketing youtubers also produce physical product since downloaded internet
also expect realize made almost billion revenue first month warhammer sale
name development game lack solid feature old total war still shine year later
dark elf corsair vampire coast pirate norscan raider ca actually participate naval battle naval capable faction lore
remember trade physically represented campaign map cart ship moving one city another could raided
remember could recruit unit without general could make custom garrison city
forget ca stripped total war name selling less product money hoping would pay attention forget heartbeat like
""

somehow someway
game managed blow straight past expectation
v liston heavyweight triple rpgs
superbowl halftime creative ingenuity
la piece de resistance anyone looking something fresh exciting seriously shake monotonous genre currently open world game
complaint performance issue pc
current patch ironed soul fan perspective game absolute bliss
ever found lamenting small quality life change one game assure part elden ring
first time soul player game offer godlike first taste incredible game company new mechanic incredibly thought flawlessly executed
core combat much
good thing
many game nowadays try reinvent wheel end complicating thing
instead stuck root managed add incredible layer combat
honestly infinite way tackle fight elden ring best part
basically viable
game allows push enemy exactly way want open world hybrid
rich content aesthetically jaw dropping
flow effortlessly way constantly exclaiming game huge without overwhelming
feat genius managed incorporate crazy satisfying miyazaki vertical level design way work
first open world attempt
fromsoft miss guy story really really good
much easier follow previous game lore still kind player like get slaying covered
npc quest line immersive ever engaging unique character impactful
make worth difficulty done amazingly well
game exactly hard make without resort artificial difficulty slider
dedicated exploring build creating powerful character becomes turn easier game becomes
late game difficulty spike also welcome
final boss really feel like super powerful demigod require bust everything match general design game different level anything ever seen
constantly taken aback sheer factor boss various enemy
side area complete awe constantly
single side area felt like whole dlc many occasion design immaculate worth mention voice acting sound phenomenal
amassed team really talented voice actor musician create immense audio immersion taken aback constantly
game play thousand different way different experience every time
gbp damn good deal
recommend emperor great game
hope ruin like helldivers rocky start loving immortal empire product received free spoiler free played past total war warhammer title absolute treat
tw wiii top game one best experience series thus far
honestly nothing else unit roster diversity alone make far better experience
doom stacking less meta unit multi roled
new siege system interesting take definitely expands past siege though could little intriguing supply defense building system leaf little desired definitely better
campaign amazing daemon prince campaign absolute treat unparalleled lord customization sold immediately
game overall feel intelligent ai respond better overall around map land mass really push away faction nearly whole game well
really good title first series great one begin game run smooth ghz ram running perfectly load time little high nothing also fairly easy please total war title experience ultimately different
update clarification current playtime work gaming industry granted press copy
edits typo rolling sheep luv emprahluv brothasluv racist jus like simple complaint orks time

game look amazing play amazing
always around frame even swarm
lot fun
game
phenomenal
try finger hole
posibilities start review numerous
think adress biggest change fromsoft done let talk though fromsoft first shot real amazing job
first time started game came open world got lost
like know go game give specific direction form waypoints point grace called game ray light attatched point direction story meant getting lost could ride around forgetting time roaming around stumbling one quest another finding dungeon fighting fieldbosses know rode trusty horse torrent around hour
may countinued story yet like didnt anthing ring really reward exploring world
healing item pick another area wouldnt expected
one first forest explored happened stumble upon circle shaped building
didnt think much time since way castle spotted horizon
examining castle went back building passed forest marked map wouldnt forget recommend take advantage marker tool since might forget point interest much see world
turn building elevator brought far plain wandered
ride wall opend bit revealed underground area sky made sparkling gem resting
one stunning view get see exploring
traveling land fun game though
course chaotic time world littered enemy
grunt boss like giant knight armored horse dragon well
encounter boss dungeon go around sense security since although grunt may grunt deadly grunt
topic let get combatfor pleasure enjoy dark soul game yet give quick summary used combat strategie look enemie winding attack wait strike dodge
successfully avoiding attack either short opportunity deal damage consists player spaming rb button dodge way next attack
time roll right retreat heal
basically combat consisted dark soul game
third installment series introduced also something called weapon art
weapon art possesed every weapon game unique move attack us mana
dark soul iii personally rarely used tho since factor hitting attack damage dealt worth elden ring major improvement made even though fromsoft might overdone aspect
one thing responsible biggest change combat new poise stat added devs
imagine poise another bar besides health bar
run enemy get staggered get perform critical strike deal massive damage simmular sekiro differs cant actually see bar
change gameplay might ask
well get player vary attack
already mentioned combat mostly relied rb button light attack
light attack much damage poise enemy though
player decide solely want rely damage light attack risk longer heavy attack deal damage bring enemy poise well
play elden ring combat whise like old dark soul game good new weapon skill fromsoft might overdone little
two three weapon game let one shot boss let cancel enemy attack making passage bit easy opinion
dont want course leave finger conclusion combat whise elden ring improved dark soul sekiro massively least still one thing left storyi sad say story probably going something everyone
typical fromsoft manner get story presented silver plate
main story line yet might confuse part
story told cutscenes item description side quest dot connect
game tell tale many dark also brighter fate
swordswoman malenia trying desperately protect brother
general rahdan rotten malenia curse seeking one last battle worthy warrior death perish sickness
kinda figure sum fromsoft created masterpiece
hell job designed boss much passion creativity
exploring always stay interesting combat enjoyable
combination make addicting magnum opus opinion must play title recommend everyone considering getting slightest
dlc horizon burn heretic eradicate xenos recommended joy killer supply line bug fixed
disbanding lord reduce upkeep penalty lead major struggle unaware cant even field army massive upkeep
campaign take like hour complete nothing kill enjoyment quicker stupid also improved upon last vortext campaign campaign still force play time keep sending rift soon pop
design essentially excludes people like like play turtle build economy expanding doom stack
mindful buy sale mortal empire dlc even patch still massive bug enter rift fight final battle collecting soul somehow stepped wait enemy hero interception never come
couldnt finish hour long campaign stupid recommended
buy game
ruthlessness mercy upon great game campaign pve showing severe sign maidenless behavior played game
changed life sad love total war game im going pay insane price thing
bought dlc
could money know easy like much time passed threre miracle happening
game improve sooo much last dlc realy fun devs
beat campaign loved every minute glorious game
nice remap keyboard correctly bunch game playable
lost average hour sleep total hour playtime far dedicated playing game honestly master piece bring hope game good
take hand game
okay game suppose
expect day promised like lot people claiming
yeah open world base building zombie monster etc gameplay quest design mmo janky
pvp server full pvp zone force pvp turn manually really lame
base building ugly bunch nasty looking unfinished base littered everywhere throughout world
turn hour latergood game bad sleep game wait go sale
also ignore playtime much longer steam show game quite impressive really nailed look feel imperium
audio really good voice acting game fall flat face amount content game extremely bare bone aaa game
campaign short pve mission pvp really care much reviewing
weapon selection ok extremely basic gun feel weak hell get worse worse difficulty enemy get even bullet spongy increase difficulty
take multiple magazine single medium sized enemy max difficulty
bolters incredibly powerful weapon lore feel like shooting rimfire
ammo availability also decrease dramatically difficulty ultimately make gun combat slow clunky marine feel like armor made paper
dodge red attack parry counter yellow attack time dodge parry counter shoot target head pistol
execution ok often take long
get armor execution otherwise basically lifted recent doom game love mix ranged melee enemy together often getting shot bit swarmed close enemy
enemy friendly attack shoot ranged enemy way blocked close also grindy time consuming improving character unlocking new armor bit
mission long uninteresting
go defend hit button go expansion also ripoff opinion
entirely cosmetic grind ton unlock cosmetic actually use
price season pas also joke get
plus want full set cosmetic weapon better preorederd ultra pity game lot potential ruined greed bare bone launch
overall pretty good whatever dont buy dlcs version scam
release new dlcs like every month bought didnt even include dlcs
please fix
update ca play csgo ca launch someone help
wanted wait write seeming though content update potentially another month
ca say thought would good time inform scour depth steam review purchase
coming total war warhammer yet purchased
new warhammer game total war general purchase
purchase warhammer
unfortunately recommend game current state
improvement since warhammer fact many downgrade
game buggy run poorly although better launch
play realm chaos main story warhammer without wanting commit seppuku
quintessential experience warhammer always immortal empire sandbox experience hundred faction battle world conquest
problem
ai
know game comparison warhammer wo pretend game developer something terribly wrong
power ranking entire campaign almost challenge depending race play verse strategy
ai put fight hide behind wall refuse expand
turn grimgor campaign purposefully kept losing giving territory second strongest faction empire
settlement
comparison
needless say heart love warhammer want game succeed
however game pure downgrade gameplay
game
love pretty particle massive map bigger better guess care world realize fatigue set third campaign challenege opposition game
adore fun game ton challenge highly recommend purchase warhammer first
truly want game flourish could much come well justify game current state
short people lore hound like great entry universe lot thing people entering franchise get versed begin understanding enemy type motif may make sense little bit reading
note may spoil enemy variety also note none required enjoy game extra context might make sense moment later contains spoiler enemy type care want know etc implore google search thousand son traitor legion magnus dreadnaught
enjoy title definitely check great lore channel youtube community welcome
honestly proud chinese many reason heard leitmotif journey west wukong theme inside cried little bit proud something made best piece medium representing chinese culture right even also everything current gaming industry producing every conceivable way
master piece art average aaa game game consumable product generation game maybe wo happen
like killing chicken
kill human
good pls fix anticheat monkey monke gud
play monke skibidi gyatt best game decent far cant speak end game pretty enjoyable though lot ingame dialog still missing
gameplay good graphic good emperor
pc potato run moment feel like sidegrade total warhammer ii
battle entirely improvement ii
consider battle meat game believe great addition series welcome development gameplay
however campaign feel great place
would first like say found prologue somewhat dull experience hold hand firmly provide significant challenge felt rail
said prologue campaign exactly game total warhammer scope always needed
proper tutorial show many mechanic digestible way helpful
veteran player target audience glad main campaign interesting idea lot like
love art direction clarity design
apart red think readable certainly ii
love little location interest map
really like concept collecting soul visiting god realm
like gameplay force player little bit proactive recruiting maintaining agent keeping force mobile pressuring player multiple front
problem range poor performance ok large amount stutter couple crash weak redundant pointless research tree bugged unit mechanic problem campaign laid problem campaign exists purely reactive gameplay
player agency event happen length little agency respond event
player must send powerful army quickly rift go chaos realm get macguffin otherwise ai get threaten win game eventually
must close rift quickly possible cause much corruption penalty become incredibly damaging
thought perhaps could farm gold xp corruption penalty make worthwhile
go chaos realm process except khorne fittingly tedious
realm take many turn go two realm many teleports consume movement activation
mean much gameplay especially tzeentchian realm gosh spent going teleport finishing turn maybe getting attacked army endturn
bad first time
fact thought pretty creative slick implementation
third campaign got second soul want
repetition getting
goal campaign slog
campaign given player also remove player agency
much total war series player agency impact level game grand strategy individual town management campaign map army composition real time tactic battle screen
ca received strong criticism past chaos invasion related player agency broken many example
vortex campaign ii good example player agency preserved campaign less mechanically interesting campaign iii dlc vortex campaign best campaign entire total war catalogue mechanically interesting open ended
prefer vortex campaign moment
campaign gave ability influence manipulate chaos incursion occur think campaign may better received
mostly like settlement battle rework
wish settlement battle instead field battle
maybe settlement defensive structure building rather every settlement
would prefer map wider clear terrain traversable
tower placement absolutely terrible like trap player sink currency feelbad gameplay
would like wider street actually place unit properly instead autoplacing bizarre thin regiment unit get traffic jam
would like immediately fix docked missile infantry able fire
broadly like best generates dynamic flowing combat defender favoured worst kinda broken least different field battle
total war total warhammer fan lot fun
creative diverse faction perhaps little unit light broad improvement series little let odd frustrating design choice lingering technical issue
start pretty good opinion going get already fan wait first round dlc turn game go special
got hundred hour already sleep ruined one turn certainly worth eventually
overwhelmingly hard overwhelmingly annoying overwhelmingly love
peak gaming experience fun desk hand keyboard product received free wu kong incredible game stunning visuals powered unreal engine
atmospheric design immersive gameplay captivating
wu kong beautiful captivating environment access feel somewhat restricted opinion definitely worth playing
burn heretic
kill mutant
purge unclean
horrible maintenance overcosted dlc threatening current state
fan even amazing game jump series
really fulfills space marine power fantasy cut tear horde tyranids using different weapon available
game get even fun playing friend matchmaking randoms
game well made apart mechanic need tweaking sure fixed due time
cant wait see store game term new enemy mission
shoot smash stomp
stomp smash kill
suffer mutant heretic xeno
emperor kill
dlc wtf buy standard edition got empty game pay dlcs get incomplete game need pay warhammer get content completed game go brrrrr slash slash brrrr enemy come enemy die repeat counter strike englishcounter strike global offensive cool game
game everything good shooter need lot player weapon map mode
game shine system lot fun reward good teamwork
classic mode fight terrorist task terrorist place bomb one two location b map protect detonates
task course prevent
also simply kill player team win round
team swapped half match played make fair
worth using voice chat give mate call tip
way improve english skill significantly school
course sometimes meet people nice bad day case every game
c go good tactical multiplayer shoter remained good day
advantage game outweigh disadvantage
ca go wrong taking strike global offensive ist ein sehr cooles spiel
diesis spiel hat alles ein guter shooter benötigt viele spieler waffen karten und modi
diesis spiel glänzt vor allem mit seinem eigenen system welches sehr viel spaß macht und eine gute teamarbeit belohnt
im klassischen modus treten gegen terroristen die aufgabe der terroristen ist e dabei eine bombe einem der beiden orte oder b zu platzieren und diese lange zu beschützen bi sie detoniert
die aufgabe der ist natürlich dy zu verhindern
e können auch einfach alle spieler eines team können auch ganz einfach eliminiert werden um eine runde zu gwinnen
die team werden nachdem die hälfte de match gespielt wurde gewechselt
da macht e sehr fair
e lohnt sich den voicechat zu verwenden um seinen mitspielern call und tipps zu geben
kann man sein englisch deutlich verbessern mehr al der schule
natürlich trifft man auch manchmal auf leute die nicht nett sind und einen schlechten tag hatten aber da ist jedem spiel
alles allem ist csgo ein sehr guter taktischer multilpayer shooter welcher sich bi heute sehr gut gehalten hat
die vorteile diesis spiel überwiegen
e lohnt sich einen blick zu riskieren
caught excruciating case scarlet rot irl real life absolute cinema
great introductory people interested warhammer
reject humanity embrace must buy

last opportunity turn thing around many player
recently moved area isps data cap home internet
game larger keep ssd play ever want
one game basically installed permanently
today uninstalling game mean never install unless creative assembly actually put type real effort saving game
move different area data cap
install play probably uninstall shortly
creative assembly basically rubbing face care game
shadow price change making less base game currently sale joke
would even buy review sake hoping might make impact company notice
refusing purchase dlc unless make meaningful change price target going dlcs
game one given least enjoyment
month entire quarter go without new content radically different first entire first year release seemed like whole year went nothing even word sometimes
campaign almost impossible beat launch faction finally corrected fix took forever
meaningful change made balance royally mess previous game save specializing anything usually start leading numerous unfinished run
big warhammer fan warhammer name pretty much guaranteed sucked salty saw price chaos dwarf dlc salty enough first time since warhammer series started total war
waited sale even still salty knew deep really pulling pant preparation next dlc shadow
creative assembly deviate mine numerous others prediction preparing u could tear u new hole
since said hole tearing option ca officially given u apologize immediately beg hole tearing
like sole choice given u well mention one option willing go
literally pick monopoly board throw across room screaming fault want extorted anymore
ruining thing everyone specifically ruining thing employee future job security completely shutting game
big total war player since shogun every one except atilla three kingdom throne britannia
total war game every single dlc
could speak cheap used back day let focus recent entry matter
standard pricing lord dlc faction dlc
remember holding beastmen wood elf dlcs warhammer solely price
thing got buy end came mini campaign whether good usually added whole different play style faction new element plain new content
warhammer tomb king vampire coast dlcs new faction added new location onto current map faction good fun enough still stay within top faction play
made truly worth price remember ca came surprised u bretonnian flc coming hero left right lore connected
ca want u pay something used cost like warhammer
let forget number thing ca want u remember get butt hurt price hike pay shut whole thing
cut planned project require minimalist effort either fire shift employee around different department locality make sure dlc continue least amount qa work done best tell world fault paying outrageous price
tl dr hold curiosity chinese culture tale god concept wu kong got abused countless game try game
game depict best spirit wu kong leave tangled story uncover good discussion wu kong next discussion go art art amazing probably best chinese company ever yield
game play also fun large variety different combination spell use refund skill point completely free
great fun thinking build different boss
game similar comparison god war better job lot aspect
constantly fighting boss little reuse model
character development amazing except would discus story book tied normal mob boss fantastic translation good job conveys majority idea hardest content translate traditional chinese
next part contains lot spoiler l chosen one play role limited character development game depict little emotion reaction shocking heart breaking breathe taking event
collecting thing avoid spoiling feel like vessel even real vessel feel vivid get fight know mean chapter questionable
take wrong chapter good starting chapter amazing steady incrementing difficulty map puzzle chapter feel short ca get lot place think able go chapter feel rush boss aid like really bad annoying boss make even bos registering feel good
great game ton variation model work rival many first person game

exploring getting lost world walking around seeing amazing thing put game treat game releasing lately technical impossibility yet really made something amazing
soul usually take around hour beat
hour currently following main path
literally went complete opposite direction actually let get punished
exploration key game outstanding job good actually getting people like soul love game like botw skyrim
know something right break mold attract like
nintendo really outdid year donkey kong
huge caveat recommendation gameplay everything come together incredible
feeling clutching round team especially friend beaten elation winning match sheer doggedness team spirit
frankly kind match even losing leave smile know would get game beginner nowadays
though know better probably try version recommend least paying account
problem cheater large could lead quick disillusionment game
veteran even leave game problem
terrible sinking feeling arrive match see enemy even teammate spinbotting obviously hacking
know wasted next minute start hacking get angry falsely believe hacking wasted even longer
either leave get cooldown matchmaking server abandoning match
intent learning competitively suggest researching service like faceit available anyone far know ecl believe currently hosting server located europe
ecl actively moderate user seems fairly welcoming community perhaps would relatively easy find people similar skill level willing help beginner
unfortunately think base experience valve matchmaking system horrible beginner might decent experience completely one toxic teammate ca remember like new worst
hope get enjoy best c offer
glove offensivethat feel spray still free old c
agitatis ultramarini dominitis ultramarini non praestatis ultramarini nobilitis ultramarini siege battle somehow less fun
ai ca even keep archer wall shoot attack
big campaign cool adding race bigger bigger campaign map make thing fun basically experience
campaign ai ca make reasonable decision even huge economic advantage adding race making map bigger really end day guess multiplayer change really cool game yet try paper pretty rad
someone played crap see many improvement bigger
lot fun playing reason
keep coming back getting hour campaign chase dragon magic gone
sad leave review mention dlc policy treat u like cash cow buggy crap release release
bad competition keep honest
game many cheater made
even thought good idea lmao negev ca making collecting miniature look economical faction fun campaign really
almost option expand rift constantly opening right beside city
wait till patch game bring blood dlc fighting battle without seeing people lose arm bleed death make quite boring especially would except gore like experience literal demon chaos realm definitely recommend grown large variety game game suffers bad pacing need play found input lag unbearable
technical review like digital foundry must turn frame generation setting global illum shadow etc cause significant input delay
buy game costing kill visual setting
optimization shockingly bad visually stunning game run well
warframe doom eternal elden ring etc example gorgeous game older system
act unfortunately run past hour time issue become apparent ca get buggy input queue spirit transformation medicine
sometimes must keep tapping button trigger usage
sometimes light tap interrupt attack combo instead queuing
sometimes nothing happens spamming repeatedly standing around bos waiting background dodge mechanic inconsistent
""
managed dodge boss ohko attack repeated experiment inconsistent
perfect dodge mechanic also trigger consistently
feel like inconsistently larger horrifically bad camera angle
game greasy camera slide algorithm detect obstruction player camera origin
camera
game got stuck behind pillar tree bush dead
also notice zoom camera stage often looking wukong leg inconsistent stage design
act game shrine right main boss
later must run back across entire stage get back bos
die many time good toxic community
astroturfing china fanboys make impossible get help raise attention devs fix
dissent allowed
everything else downvoted harrassed
ca even make recommendation tuning graphic setting
even asking tune difficulty trap needless argument get good
amazing rude older adult job kid still want enjoy communicated improving game
best wait actual substantial update making aug act
act easily time larger act extremely tedious
invisible wall everywhere
many corner look like explored dead end visual design prevent u wasting time
ca interact environment unlike genshin impact
flying
wall climbing
even warframe free game bullet jump wall latch
movement make monkey king look fight act also lame
dance bos leg camera always twitching leg floor
company call game science claiming serious science engineering studio
learned lesson goty game past decade unlocking skill game play also boring
enemy long attack chain yet must keep dodging upgraded attack disrupt
thus dodge fest cheese charging thrust stance right
even boring
ca spam magic magic recharge get special gourd much later
save spell transformation cheesing entire stageorbe forced tododgedodgedodgedodgebecause enemy interrupted without charged heavy attack
keep dodging focal point enough heavy attack
repeat story devs never studied culture history
reason love journey west even studied asian religion philosophy university deeply respectful profound allegorical discourse absent civilisation
story writing perspective important
year profound rich source material exists story abundance create beautiful cast character deep complex portrayal could made story profoundly moving
none seen
journey west written time circa buddhism thrived huge sprawling dynastic empire circa tang dynasty
buddhism came circa bce shamanism rich regional folk lore taoism circa bce confucius circa bce hundred school thought era manner secular sect already deeply rooted
journey west rare culmination allegorical novel writing popular century
yet none used character shallow lacking depth
buddha bodhisattva liar neglecting vow
celestial court full superficial violent immortal
human weak animal mercy
demon always evil birth nature
profound essence china culture longer exists game
like china city today exists game beautiful facade
china culture original novel countless profound moment exist
one love length journey chapter walk young till old old till young even cycle would still difficult reach end journey
truly achieve resolute perception wisdom realising exists thing immediately arrived spirit mountain end journey
countless line beautiful prose poetry peppered across original loyalty brotherhood stand contrast easy victory unscrupulous tactic
moment realise wukong fiery temper violence person deeply care right thing deep penetrating wisdom cut commonly accepted social belief
disappointingly
gone
left beautiful spectacle mired aggressive toxic fanboys superficial court studio maybe ultimate allegory spiritual successor lamentation modern china
true intent game developer
great game story great

update leaving original review still relevant review remains hard unless sale
marked dlcs add less less add original pain title clear devs point giving everyone middle could leave review would since ca thumb campaign fun first time albeit spit face wh lore general made sake campaign

scream run part fun
ogre coming get ya
game masterpiece great game game kick
excellent shooter immerses player warhammer say game bit pricey current content roadmap already released content end campaign sequel first opus played solo player
really good rather short say hour play
less scripted campaign customize space marine play different class
fairly short designed played several time improve character
also pvp mode really cool
progression pretty good want keep playing unlock next weapon cosmetic unfortunately map game mode conclusion recommend fan universe anyone looking good shooter advise buy reduced price wait developer add little content
dear fromsoftware give u bloodborne please would love buy finished product
super earth oh wait wrong gamepraise emperor try finger holefort complaint endless loading screen thought nearly finished game discovered new zone xd game end end first opening scene game gave flashback god war good game first time buying big triple aaa game without discount genre soul open world game run great year old variety weapon character creation look fast map help feel like open thing discover limited useful guide direction active community moment long may continue summons summons early boss seem bit hard even summons feel like might need much grind although fun progress area literally take leap difficult spot lost soul mean graceoverall disappointed got release day although perfect style game point satisfying gameplay glaring issue
recommend hope get polish soon pro style feel universe really hit head
alone probably gotten game
really adore crunchy sound design gear use feel pretty good design limited loyal fairly rhythmic fighting parry counter enemy bos fight tough angel death difficulty typically manageable caveat story bit shallow good glaring issue ally ai
horrendous pathetically bad
make bos fight absolute slog trying balance proceed fight
also destroys immersion seeing astarte knuckle f ing corner fighting box hit box bad
get hit bizarre range often shoot invisible wall attacking enemy
also struck countless time cover ranged melee attack one annoying thing game enemy leaping talking parry counter turn air ya yeet lock though understand swarm hitting sort point getting stun locked poor choice
one like stun lock
one like losing control character
one want health gone gaunts
need trade dark fantasy age elden ring absolute masterpiece mastered art showing without telling
vastly different game experienced witcher skyrim story questline driven
elden ring impose particular playstyle route
completely free want start game
finish main storyline beat final bos explore entire map without ever seeing main boss
truly outside influence
sense freedom choice exploration game mention elden ring also mastered art subtlety
example game like skyrim various element character dialogue leveling system various landmark could clearly point contributing game success
however case
hard place finger one specific thing make elden ring enjoyable
many time gone play game half hour become immersed losing track time playing hour end
believe game feature
combat system transportation landscape lore storytelling complement way none overbearing
time element come together fluid manner player notice drawn level immersion felt game game one enormous intricately detailed world ever seen gaming
single moment map felt desolate empty always something see explore
castle city fortress must traverse game truly
massive unique filled plethora secret area waiting uncovered
landscape world also astonishing
sheer variety scale environment sight behold
player expect explore vast mountain forest field deep cave ancient ruin even hidden underground civilization
clear great amount work went design area exceptionally detailed complex lore realism beauty make joy combat game utterly masterful blending element many fromsoftware previous work including dark soul bloodborne sekiro create extremely tense fluid customizable combat system
amount variety term different playstyles build variation weapon type enough make combat game endlessly also freedom approach combat previous soul game thanks bunch familiar new system used interesting way
stealth viable option thanks addition finally let sneak tough enemy get behind critical hit horseback combat large open area give mobility ability attack side weapon drawback taking away ability roll way big attack craft item fly using material found world ready whatever situation call summon large variety creature fight unique ability situational advantage substantially equip ash war weapon completely change affinity ash war system essentially combine two element prior soul game weapon affinity weapon skill making item freely equip armament
example let say find really good rapier like moveset building character focus intelligence stat mean get kind damage bonus need viable weapon
find art war bestows magic spell onto weapon equip transform magic weapon thereby giving intelligence scaling top whatever skill ash war
best eventually decide different build still keep weapon put different ash war onto
course also find specific item unlock different affinity nonetheless incredibly smart addition allows ton variety preferred bos roster elden ring also extremely difficult unforgettable
bos battle remarkably challenging rich lore breathtaking
complex fighting style boss overlooked
many boss extremely intricate fast punishing attack tough avoid fun fight
make battle boss feel like dance rhythmically dodge devastating combo attack finding small window go offensive
nothing new style bos encounter exactly dark soul series pioneered
however elden ring perfect formula giving boss bigger movesets greater speed complex combo ever
boss hammer long combo little margin error player must master bos moveset ever hope come top
combine grotesquely stunning visual design get tensest engaging bos battle top epic scope bos encounter vast area heightened elden ring stellar musical score
perfectly conveys emotional connection whichever bos fighting
many soundtrack game utterly way video game overall opinion elden ring life enormous hype surrounding proving one memorable challenging complex gaming experience last review helpful please leave rating
award also greatly appreciated
best first person shooter ever made skill knowledge gap
constant improvement update
c go lot problem hitboxes gun balance near perfect

beautiful desolation
basically aaa low fantasy stalker fewer bandit everything thought game could crucible knight though
armoured bastard
long time player counterstrike
known stumpsy stump born disability hand stumbled across csgo around
obviously really bad first started played c casual game friend much better
started messing around setting changed everything
discovered setting raw mouse input able pick mouse finger setting literally changed way able play literally accelerated gameplay
flicked fast direction able navigate around map aim without lift mouse pad
say turning right would fast flick right back center fast flick right etc
could basically full within like swipe
raw mouse input turned setting negates follows mouse move
really bummed removing setting pretty much ended entire csgo gaming experience considering deleted csgo altogether replacement
looking forward playing game friend tried many different setting try replicate raw mouse input
game fps game offered setting like reason stuck around playing csgo many year
suck watching friend play without suck feeling like longer enjoy game gave much joy many year
hope devs valve see add setting back included video explaining play mouse raw important
video play explained sorry hard understand tried best view finally got around making video cause heap people requesting
took lot gut even talk front camera conscious speech problem

pray rngesusyou playing campaign way want somehow made game feel linear play
playing tall incentive also play hoping legendary lord would uniqueness
still okay
regular lord still obvious worst best like cathay dragon lord v normie lord punishing ever spell garbage
like ice magic overpriced version spirit leech already understand ca working towards great game nose dived one
feel like many problem persist improvement many issue good time
game worth
one situation like oh screw
take improve
goofed potential getting big thumb make serious made lot big change
big thing immortal empire good stuff associated
main campaign also improved
settlement battle still bad nearly frequent
overall still give thumb improvement done
like fixing normie lord v actually good lord would big shame masterpiece game year
grim darkness far future war good game fun
steam must work vac system skin game fun good recommend buy game much people hacking game especially matchmaking mm
dont buy valve fix massive cheater problem
peace
purging never felt good
amazing game requires ssd
pro fantastic visuals capture good variety playstyles among good visual customization individual armour satisfying gunplay melee visceral large arsenal weapon minor variation along progression tyranids extremely well realized
nailed scope swarm
gargoyle swarm absolutely managed convey scope tyranid invasion
even worse perfectly fine approximation given limited computing power
tyranid dynamic translated nicely gameplay
take warrior gaunts collapse take hive tyrant bring entire assault screeching halt
special bioforms feel distinctive accurate lictor favourite
fact auspex scan reveals initial bos encounter basically predator sound cue whenever lictor lurking make great character cardboard customize
wan na play vanguard
gon na playing decimus jackson cast general cutscene presentation cast tragically flat
titus miserable cu fitting gadriel needlessly antagonistic construe drama chairon alright guess
also zero facial expression mcangus usual trope hate gut first come around realizes right along
boring air probably gw mandated phobos captain miniature
glimpse personality overall interesting design enough screen time really explore character
wished fleshed characterization good potential especially tzeentchian calgar though gravitas intensity looked comical fighting
could badass scene swarmlord something
anything really mark chapter master
quite general seems like match intensity actual gameplay cutscenes
feel lifeless often uncanny unfinished
really wanted done campaign asap enjoy ops mode without spoiler good sign said actual meat game good
melee shooting feel great gotten hang combat flow
tyranids developed front tzeentch providing slight spike difficulty lacking satisfaction gory finisher internal faction probably spend good amount time playing operation class feel distinct enough get fresh experience even limited mission set
solid warhammer enthusiast
probably tourist
lo mejor del juego e inspeccionar perfiles cuando mueres la cuentas que tienen prime en faceit one time wish middle ground recommended recommended
aside largely circumstantial issue epic game integration performance problem people neither personally problem thing game right thing worse first game
normally write review especially one longer sentence feel like say least thing every general aspect game start good side story serf predecessor well answer lot question subtle reference really liked overall well written especially compared recent visuals sense scale impressive fidelity would expect aaa title animation work unique sense necessarily copy either space marine astarte unique take depicting space marine fluid audio level darktide especially soundtrack get job done quite well lot place
disappointing sound like heavy bolter otherwise manages feel bad mediocre side gameplay hit miss
break paper sound good execution leaf something desired
ranged combat okay weapon bit inaccurate longer burst carried superhuman warrior space marine feel lot feeling like less powerful counterpart first game fulfilling purpose another weapon fulfill better
melee combat main problem
better playing like dark soul rolling around pve pve parry simply inconsistent
matter perfectly time parry already playing animation like attack cancel animation
problem get worse attack even knife chainsword much slower clunkier counterpart first game
additionally pve enemy interrupt attack hitting interrupt using method make feel unfair also weightless
hurt experience help timing get offset every time hit something
finally melee pvp cheated easily rolling kind like cheat pve rolling
even try parrying gamble
make combat feel unfinished badly designed really hope addressed currently biggest pet peeve customisation nonexistent chaos practically nonexistent space marine
chaos class limited warband playing raptor example night lord
change colour still retain night lord model piece go class warbands
far concerned exist chaos
primaris also lackluster
less option first game lacking variety department especially come content
also please love emperor give u back space marine
primaris
space marine
everyone like primaris design certainly
feel like would fall deaf ear like gw ever listens community decent game
hard judge part good couple part really bad hard dictate one outweighs largely dependent user expects game
sabermarine stand chapter master defend imperium gamers heresy chaos befallen precious imperium
praisesun overwatch ops first roleplay event argentinian rp connoisseur agent smith

operation x history total war warhammer complex
since warhammer battle march dreaming total war picking setting
tww released bought instantly heaven
tww ii ascended beyond mortal plane bliss skaven main
real tww ii made tww look like tech demo
mortal empire excellent dlc content another cherry top
tww iii actually excite much optimistic
yes care ogre kislev monogods
tww fun
came pretty happy
ton bug bad design decision still fun lot content price
point many people already vocalizing discontent quality ca work yet share opinion
reality thing happened title like battlefield v war thunder happened tww developer studio disconnected player
since grace left community management relation worsened
player feedback largely ignored
praised feature discontinued
bug adressed
short ca modus operandi shifted quality game produce player goodwill thus steady longterm income make much money possible short time frame possible
deal tww used base game price efficient lot good content dlc less price efficient freshened experience stretched base game content
crux story old race pack dlcs got content price base game
fine date bought literally every single dlc
chaos dwarf dlc shifted content around half price base game
understandably people upset least got completely new race great mechanic lord
newest dlc charged price way less content
old lord pack dont introduce new race player got one new lord per faction new unit hero changed whole playthrough
one additional lord also released free player
lord pack always cost
new lord pack shadow change introduces three lord free lord everyone
new unit part reskins
hero shake playthroughs
unit best support unit pretty irrelevant vortex beast maybe excepted cool
charge
price increase
ca taken opportunity overhaul mechanic community calling since release unfinished unfun annoying
communicated player criticism
even content creator ca creator program called dlc cash grab
buy warhammer iii
maybe promise tww kept
get dlc stretch base game reasonable price
bug plagued game release still fixed
consumer one way vote money
would recommend buy tww iii
maybe ca wake change direction like gaijin done war thunder
maybe fall flat like battlefield would get invested
game masterpiece u played soul like game dark soul bloodborne
first open world game dark soul bloodborne lore insane huge graphic greatest ever seen far
probably spend hour less open world feel like confused lost remember open world understand guide wiki elden ring everything absolutely worth continue
performance pc kinda good bug depends probably game pc spec like gpu
overall game absolutely goty rating recommend game first soul like game
góður leikur versta samfélag
played enough hour form thought game summary campaign basically wanted sequel space marine exceeded expectation offer one epic cinematic experience gaming especially sense meticulously crafted detail could read story book feel lvl something else entirely dont like gameplay loop dont bother one main factor make game enjoyable feel like space marine visceral chonky combat power fantasy expands pve various perk pve connected main story remains epic still fun unique mission thing strive grind forpvp quite fun due gameplay loop reminds halo time quick easy pvp fast round fast killsthose mode need love balancing content feature already good indicatorsnow mode appeal well gameplay loop wont worth youand bonus warhammer fan customisation look incredible look like actually painting mini without investing ofc wont replace whole thing damn best visual fashion fest could possibly find gaming cant wait chapter set cant say enough much love looking variously customised painted model game perfect thing work reach goty easy recommend loving already might goty end year term feeling invokes playing much appreciate thing care multiplayer stability issue gay still gay
jk jklove game
love game one gave steam point wonderful someone generously gave point need cant wait mod fix demo product refunded could even get past opening cinematic high spec machine
probably would blast game could even get play
spent minute loading alone quickly closing hour refund window
got money back holy crap focus
bad first impression pick game year several update reduced price love gun gaming aweosme favorite part u fall hole lose million rune ca beat soldier godrick guy told game easy single player casuals everytime ask help get told get gud continue try beat possible change review
want hear
love soul game adventure game rpg element action rpg game whatever love game sure elden randomly got kicked game got day ban due valve vac letting rejoin game server money robbing bastard hundred maybe thousand hour game combined later dozen dlcs bought ca chooses screw player last sprintedit ca seems taken turn right direction maybe forced player feedback still right deliver quality content expect people play buy game simple
okay willing get depression wave every second played c never knew people could m reaction time
also never knew global elite looking ground could flick kill every time
far game fun experience could easily recommend
graphic absolutely gorgeous pleasant surprise game performance run well
sound effect music point make feel immerse mythological setting
gameplay pretty good dodging feel fluid attacking nice responsive feeling
boss encountered pretty unique different movesets feel refreshing fun encounter new bos
character story far pretty intriguing lore especially pretty good introducing newcomer mythology others already familiar reference tie original source negative environmental map design get pretty confusing especially chapter lack map contributes often lost although could horrible sense direction
lastly placement invisible wall act quite jarring encounter path thought could traverse time missed path thinking invisible wall
anyway monkey game gud
game amazing much unstable evolving backwards
freeze get much common turn played
beyond turn every turn
review recap patch game received balance change fix stand right still pve beauty say doesnt problem
term pvp still mess even though dueler code gained awareness community playerbase leaving due difficulty
game issue regard yes
nothing casual playerbase good player complaining start personal issue worry one
patched slightly still stand blood katana weapon much
bleed proc weapon insanely fast combo fairly good range minor fp consumption matter since win die becomes issue far much damage finished fighting miquella one summons got two fact
due multiple attempt used katana shredded bos health couple
weapon insanely good boss paired pose less damage mixed
pve boss
imagine pvp issue problematic seems
long range bleed ton damage fast might well turn instant kill hack effect differ issue game
boss bit uninspiring time
ca fully blame though since many quite amazing memorable weird dark soul standard
however dark soul game expecting see major dragon like seath scaleless add
movesets
ok
bos seems taken different take moveset dark soul
meaning dark soul bos move went well certain rythms followed elden ring thought rythm dark soul already familiar decided change
attack slow lingering hitboxes make ton sense sometimes annoying combo either insanely fast ridiculously mean
well elden ring tailor made screw soul gamers timing really screwing known previous game prevent easy legacy player
accept difficulty change rythm shift move still feel like robbing player long hitboxes last slow area also problematic since design seems beginner level difficulty set simply adding many enemy one location seems little thought mogh area example enemy also share crappy design spamming spazzing attack incredibly annoying speed
feel annoyance challenge really hurt game compared previous soul shame think myasaki losing still much enjoy game think absolutely fantastic many regard
easily goty choice sheer ammount content exploration everything else game exploration mindblowing quest line mysterious amazing ever need know
searching part fun everything else despite everything bad mentioned game still stand fantastic experience worth double price asks least
keep mind thing one considered bad along community member
regardless game still peak experience gameplay story build creativity everything else
far one best world series fromsoft ever negative review
people search negative see worth buying game despite bad thing mentioned hope help get expect shooting slashing xenos heretic filth
expect grand story many twist warhammer story fighting
overall good game
overpriced many overpriced dlcs got worse even expensive later
critical bug took forever solved
playing nearly hour could stomach fraction uninstalling
korean one day take csgo like conquered starcraft overwatch league legend hero storm many
hail supreme leader
love love love
storytelling animation scenery music insanely good
wait see incredible story come one featuring god like erlang shen nezha
arghh
many amazing story tell world excited see take u next tip struggling combat take easy patient learn bos pattern
start focusing dodging feel confident gradually begin attacking bos
easy peasy lemon squeezy
many hacker many hacker
yes enjoy since last patch played different faction turn never single performance issue bug run fine experience warhammer faction new feature
negative review experienced
cheating strike monkee really love game bit one best fromsoft put issue pc port horribly optimized like every soul game released pc dark soul prepare die edition
constant stuttering freeze allow enemy easily kill
really good game great story ok pvp pve also charcoal black skin option sally major issue game matchmaking highly consistent stacking one team full high level efficient player one team full brain rot traitor marine customization change colour thats bulkward class pure trolling press c damage immunity damage hit front even hit shield get disconnected basically reboot entire game log whole three map pvp badly made junction l bend pve mode good part unless one join pregame lobby class already taken one run meter change classits great game recommend put negative review want devs see complaint game pretty good reading give already finished game three time got ta say beautiful game far good lucky enough suffer much issue others seemed run well rig ultra setting issue far turn ui scaling cause rather far played nurgle admit turn much enjoying mechanic absolutely love little nurglings want spread love pox
spec intel core ram asustek motherboard samsung ssd evga section covered view prior immortal map release patch fixing honeymoon ui made worse roster lacking many lack faction make play style limited main campaign mechanic get old quick mode terrible longer play likely crash start acting weird stuttery
immortal map hotfix game much improved ui longer covering part game much improved battle front better unit combat flow charge movement dependant unit tactic flying unit improved map nice detail seems better sorted resource allocation hardware game flow overall map much improved ai taking random target always moving one town end scooby doo chase much welcome change battle feel feel worth option faction tactic along variety much improved improving
first time playing game
bought game love story journey west sun wukong
second bos thought would immediately rage quit game
committing attempt finally realized made game fun
learning bos exploring area fully finding secret upgrading wukong honestly made one addicting game ever played
chapter know end want
highly recommend anyone great challenge
game definitely worth purchase
pro graphic unlike anything ever seen challenging challenging like soul game unique boss chapter video artwork general beautiful much longer expected finished first playthrough hourscons missing map see player
also make difficult find thing going minor graphical bug hitboxes certain boss making way harder need beoverall much fun playing game like year
rare pick game manages keep attention past first couple day also make deeply invested story character artwork
honestly surprised see kind quality china aaa title
easily goty quite frankly one top game oat
regret buying game
warhammer fan approached warhammer space marine cautious optimism trying set bias aside
verdict
okay
let dive deeper undeniably fun badass space marine
mowing horde xenos incredibly satisfying every execution felt intensely gratifying
pvp mode brought wave nostalgia reminding shooter
simple despite bit undercooked highly enjoyable
admittedly spent time pvp finishing campaign
different class felt distinct utility without glaring balance pve side solid option casual fun friday night
warhammer fan especially one love space marine lot appreciate
customization option space marine extensive letting personalize character much little want nice game impressive though control feel bit clunky first
thankfully customizable keybindings help smooth experience
however animation feel stiff ai companion frustratingly inept especially defense mission higher real highlight pvp combat
mechanic simple execution satisfying customization option especially loyalist space marine dress impress vibe reminiscent classic game
heretical astarte though get love term customization missed praise taper
story
basic straightforward premise leave much chew put controller
pvp fun limited three game mode handful map
despite engaging core gameplay lack meaningful progression hold back something truly special
also encountered bug seem widely discussed yet
instance character would sometimes randomly fly across map worse every start clipping floor
fortunately reloading last checkpoint restarting game usually fixed issue still frustrating final bos especially higher difficulty dragged far long making feel like overstayed welcome left bit sour taste end warhammer space marine decent experience fall short key area could made brother emperor help help yes buy arguably one best game ever created period
wait mortal immortal
empire part come
enjoyed vortex campaign lot might
otherwise grind
new faction fun campaign part really annoying play
edit playing campaign review stand
new faction well designed core game campaign mess
combined lingering technical issue way recommend one right
likely change mind full game released
edit immortal empire game rock
friend family may see time
almost hr played solo wo comment multiplayer experience besides mention novice server started pretty low pop run across player first started felt like world empty started getting worried looking another fallout happy say ended great
world really opened went meyer market
started seeing game really offer
fun boss equally fun design location quest
deviant personality environmental detail encourage reward exploration
perfect
voice acting incomplete bug mute
idea bother eternaland
process unnecessarily complicated
chill creative game still early release minor issue worth complaining
state gaming one gem getting much attention deserves
false emperor approves monke euro dlc take month try fix bug
time review finished prologue campaign animation work best fleshed story graphic improved art direction siege rework perfect huge improvement old diplomacy rework seems perfect
everything needed included love outpost noted didnt play around much lot content keep busy till im mortal empire clearer information pretty much everything like value diplomacy stats increase level etc
bad option turn tutorial prologue shame experienced player story good veteran quite annoying learn right click chaos realm visually amazing survival battle end realm really drag luckily autoresolve change seem sake changing thing
ui mixed bag
change improvement others worse much red lighting bit icon library match major issue optimization
played resolution playing ultra really might issue higher resolution didnt encounter stutter ai took turn wasnt big deal second wont fixed optimization easily beat
highly subjective combat feel terrible clicking c parry doesnt always work clicking space doesnt always work
frustrating experience maybe buy discount emperor new world wanted emperor protects review bombing lot meaningful change expect work good
content rich quite short though really waiting mortal empire campaign girlfriend asked buy ring
looking several style finally chose one
complain game released poor complained rare complained lack communication cai complain constant new bug said didnt complain price new audacity go practially say buy dlc stop supporting respecting right getting review bombed threaten customer buy product else
power decided get exist anymore money
think crash burn someone else wo raise ash pick wh series try make better
would rather game get support insulting u insulting game insulting warhammer ip corporate greed
would stop playing game even tho love death would mean warhammer anymore someone else come along pick stated remains true satisfied newest dlc ammount change content brought
combat good
like weapon selection
look great
product received free poor community managementfeature incomplete gameplayskeleton crew working gamesomehow even managed shoot foot multiplayer single player crowd also introducing power creep dlc date
said dlc generally mandatory player success mp however recent one much mandatory
top single player difficulty trivialized implicitly threatened pull plug
seems ca learned kingdom see supporting studio long term even viable option game love liable get butchered discarded drop hat
hyena
game year late established market
spend time money deserving studio
incredible game strategy game lover
endless replay ability highly recommend
great game terrible practice price netting dlc making cost wont buy putting sale giving key seller get rest missed shameless practice 感谢aaa风灵老祖的无限喝酒法术 game year human chinese offspring rust division phase never ended
game design flow well thought
timegated progression seasonal wipe casuals chance stay competitive hardcore crowd
offer pve pvp although pvp server mostly playing
cosmetic
lot well designed quality life feature already release
season change different scenario challenge provide fresh gameplay despite wipe
important progress carry season effort vain
game share bug typical new release nothing game breaking
development team incredibly active seemingly work fix bug transparency discord
price free go wrong giving try
monke finally dlc overpriced amount content skip title dlc creative assembly figure better financial longevity plan
bit learning curve start enjoying game quite bit
whenever press game always turn game
game pretty fun use gaming chair anime build megaknight build product received free introduced deep lore massive fan loving game mechanically also lore bit got deep dive watching youtube breakdown slay demon magnus nothing wrong
politics yay game really cool update playable nice see developer improve game want player stay really cool game reached supreme win meet alot ppl actually friend say thanksfully game got another chance life appreciate award point smth luv completely new warhammer franchise fully understand vast amount lore within game however story completely approachable andi fully enjoyed time game
character development mission first aspect story refreshing experience
would best describe game mix gear war doom helldivers unique welcomed experience right
multiplayer really enjoyable like customization element
wrapping story already plan start second play
typically purchase game early access one glad
duty monke fight monke funny monke cool super fun game far graphically stunning
game paced pretty fast get bored map pretty straightforward mostly linear reminds map older game like darksiders stuff part map section fully explore
depends like vast open world something straighforward like
one fair share open world actually welcome surprise game sight
fight also fast paced fun similar style dark soul albeit arguably easier
definitely recommend getting game return monke
loved game feel like bygone age one microsoft xbox putting fight maybe even winning sony console war
entertaining linear story mode around hour normal mode though maximum enjoyment played least seen recap space marine
understanding warhammer lore man operation mode see play different marine customize head toe different class go mission aspiring trying level score better moment mission complete
mostly feel good play multiple run needed upgrade level space marine
also seasonal part game expect content update unless something completely unexpected happens also fun dry nonsense pvp akin old cod lobby without vulgarity racism probably yet
hope devs update eternal war mode well cause good building block work fun consisting dodge parry outmaneuver counterattack enemy respectively
much learn timing melee combo weapon chaotic gameplay still sometimes give problem even mastered intricate art murdering alien already fan
good game amazing especially one fresh early access
load thing high med low intensity something progress matter kind content looking
story great compelling
every single bug issue game minor thing honestly take away game support team good responding
sometimes use cookie cutter response see issue either generally thing like acknowledging ticket
bad experienced multiple bug given small honestly even bothered
none prevented content way
small thing like example sometimes resource stack properly
stack gravel stacked together would result bug losing single storage space short time
overall easily one favorite game come long time would love see become popular
best fps game ever got improve release operation specific date
love total war game especially warhammer franchise
first ever review steam usually even bother review bad game
game unplayable
warhammer ii hand best total war ever
however performance running game kill pc
hundred redditers already mentioned game bring pc even
game crash pc crash sh campaign bug siege battle unplayable
campaign new mechanic good
siege battle difficult reasonable
warhammer ii also fun cheesing siege battle
warhammer iii broken ai tower keep rebuilding unlimited amount tower regardless timer
sometime allows attack construction sometime ruined franchise fan waited year finale series decided give u unfinished product every aspect optimization gameplay
ca ashamed done u
think game player lost faith fix issue
main campaign much annoying stuff want conquer map army spawning every turn right middle territory keep multiple army sitting inside settlement defend needed
khorne especially stupid every idle army reduce city growth ca level army raiding territory somehow always enough movement left escape try fight really hope immortal empire good old want conquer world without annoying campaign stuff based around big sad lonely ice immortal empire good old sandbox mode
game fun
game year
almost decade wished sequel space afraid would never happen
thq crashing burning left possibility true sequel limbo
spite overwhelmingly positive review steam fairly large cult following doubt anyone would pick ball finish relic shock couple year ago trailer wanted shout joy almost instantly became skeptical
worried beloved game could never sequel deserved current development culture
new studio would gut made soul insert contrived modern trope disrespect source setting
never happy marine marvelous
taken relic masterpiece new height added new mechanic enhance experience expanded multiplayer seamlessly weaving campaign making far interesting addictive predecessor
bigger bloodier even bad story continues wonderfully connected previous installment ending chapter promise leaving ready next sequel
nail vibe warhammer outright stunning moment
setting previous game treated reverence attention hour lost engaged immersed awestruck spectacle even come believe would never saber focus gw everyone made happen
awesome game valve would disable ability get game russian turk would recommend game sadly case
core game great
enemy variety leaf little desired interface slightly clunky side mission far starting hate way tied health armor system melee
especially higher difficulty feasible regain health certain ring dodge parry suck
feel like duck tape solution wanting implement dark timing requiments filling screen swarm enemy
becomes annoying indecipherable ammo replenishment mechanic work bos fight physically yank camera away look bird trying replenish game lot jank getting way great overall ca recommend game finished ai unable actually handle newer content faction like empire completely eliminated early told buy new dlc stop developing game say stop modders happy stabilise mod free
game year monke never ever circumstance support ca hard earned money unless reevaluate attitude towards customer
right discus privilege entitlement earned playing game
mean paid spent numerous hour getting bug cringe animation issue apparently earned right vocal
monke go brrrr
amazing game
overwhelmingly hard overwhelmingly annoying overwhelmingly lovable
hour pretty close complete game still impress great game play
advise waiting little purchasing server issue fixed
yet finished
main campaign well designed
simple fun come aim mostly movement second strategy third valve system nutshellhttp mention year old kid mostly poland russia turkey screaming following pl ru anani sikerim tr ive wasted many hour keep damaging health reason stay away like heroin
trade hold probably worst move made valve

great work
everything
much room improvement game absolutely astonishing every single aspect
graphic incredible gameplay story really good
simply say anything bad regarding game would lying
thinking buying think cause worth every single euro
game bit let seeing lot hype
combat feel like sloppy version like weird hit box extremely limited option wish fight
game linear pushing one bos another fight one loadout game want variety choice beyond talent
pickup minimal item boss
becomes stale bos grind extremely quickly little else
bos npc item ground bos npc item ground bos etc repeat entire game
enjoy soul game go x location weapon location armour make build fun grind stats specific thing wield specific item whereas wukong none game look nice graphic good performance brilliant quite area causing stuttering lag however type issue likely patched future give much weight overall opinion
would give game maybe fun hour got stale quickly even progressing rapidly boss
felt compelled go back play point game drawn fact thinking cost feel meh paid
enjoy endless bos spam action game cup tea want something bit depth variety think disappointed product received free community suck good everyone hate word appropriately describe immense joy fun playing game
elden ring take concept soulsborne title improves upon go beyond expectation
open world beautiful lot location explore goody grab
boss fun challenging always satisfying beat

srsly
hour assuming much feel better later game f feel drive want get positive aspect equal negative pretty world fine flat ground lot collision issue hang ups climbing mechanic

spirit transformation cool flavor light attack essentially required
initiating attack fast sit big flashy animation waiting next show middle spinny attack nice unlocks require set waiting period get unless pepper combo chance getting interrupted clearing rough may aoe heavy hitter later limited mostly single target clear trash mob get tiring get interrupted often
hit basic wolf guy time get stunned whole day get poked middle baton pretty eh rest
requirement epic multiplayer service listed store well fact needed play game single epicedit dumbass telling epic required play multiplayer
well uninstall epic multiplayer service ca even access september happy refund game made studio support war ukraine paying tax russia

amazing combat satisfying sköj på ren svenska game meet people different ethnic background
jump ecstasy whenever interact friendly welcoming community
diverse community race gender religion restriction
""
got called hacker best moment life modern masterpiece fromsoftware took everything learned soul series applying towards game redefines open world game
consistently found wondering could packed much incredible content game sacrificing immense scope killed final bos roughly boss play time actually much longer steam say reason playtime still find wondering
although performance issue problem pc relatively lucky since launch even thought system far worse reviewer experienced issue ryzen gtx
point however performance issue gone able run game buttery smooth high setting occasional dip exploring
game perfect however
many repeated bos encounter bos encounter rely bit heavily taking another enemy multiplying instead adding new bos entirely
also recurrent problem certain enemy type appearing often
helped however remarkable number enemy type wholly unique point beating final bos went exploring happened across new enemy type seen even though thought seen everything reused asset
said game definitely flawed flaw detract game meaningful way would disservice play game see soul genre right
tl dr game flawed masterpiece
flawed dark soul launch especially pc certainly perfect
must play
yes
product received free good game
fort night tell kind destined extermination
mmm im monkee beat death staff could find server regardless choose even said empty
immortal empire finally feel like year making led every war hammer john horus
csgo first like rank important game thought see
game isnt rank skin fun plague cheating
great game
would recommend like white screen even playing game instantly refunding definitely fun game play stunning view everywhere game ton legendary famous eastern novel first ever seen game challenging boss smooth action playing interesting system etc
combined game well thoughtful design
see put massive effort game give birth masterpiece eastern fantasy world
one could improved sure better guidance directional tool least tell complaint
played around hour finished first chapter
crash lagging issue game
kudos game science team
great game good job
overall amazing game great story solid combat
would buy minor downside lack map would made exploring lot easier
product received free nice game many cheater great game would recommend warhammer also recommend like shooting smashing bashing slashing recommend ai game friendlieswould recommend game making actually feel like space marine
right discus entitlement earn playing game ca pr department fantastic warhammer romp chainsword go burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr emperor fish good game every ring elden eldenring graphic forget reality look long gameplay watch paint dry audio deaf audience grandma pc requirement check run rich ask nasa spare computer game size floppy old eat hard want entire hard drive hold need invest black hole hold data difficulty press easy learn hard significant brain dark soul grind nothing u care necessary average grind much need second life grinding story replace life game time long enough cup infinity beyond price free worth u spare money could also burn money bug never heard minor get ark survival game big terrarium bug
good free survival game sometimes bug new wait watch overall good free game try roam meet walking bus leg make home much game ruined cheater smurfs
worth wasting time
guess hot take bring clown award opinion black myth wukong live hype
absolutely lacking many way could believe playing based review read sorry step toe new favorite game true
way compelled continue playing first session starter game performance unstable best even cpu ram liquid cooled machine
constantly unexpectedly dipped laughably low frame rate point thought game ran microsoft power point even setting low medium rtx dlss set performance frame capped
past world traversal boring gaming done decade
nothing fight handful trash mob find meditation spot fight boss
mean like every new bos
never even understand fighting half time super forgettable
title really wukong bos rush something accurate like
learn fight long enough beat never think game scenery ridiculously bland everything look
useful land mark constantly getting lost back tracking circle
top absolutely nothing make like monkey god running around
basic sprint
cool flip
world interaction
wall run
climbing
swinging
staff trick
even double jump
painfully boring run around game omg amount invisible wall dead end explorable core gameplay loop sluggishly traverse uninteresting
kill trash mob stumble across
spend hour learning gimmicky move
finally beat repeat itthis game way shallow bland right
got bored first sitting even finish
admit though boss beautifully crafted imaginative design ultimately matter seem basic concept ai spam attack reset every often
felt like fighting bos reskinned even hour play time
mention fight literally ripped game almost zero change like ornstein smough game main draw combat extremely hollow
block system
parry system
backstab system
stealth system
literally dodge stick
rest come handful spell stance transformation also inconsistent like ca even jump transformed
dodge window feel awful
enemy stun lock constantly
ton cc
input scanning
animation lock
overpowered status effect like poison fire
spongy enemy inflated health pool
boss become impervious attack still hit
every cheesy trick book create artificial difficulty prolonged encounter
frustrating rewarding finally beat something wo feel accomplished happy got lucky enough beat enemy gimmick one time hour failure nothing look forward except desperately trying dark soul god war fails count
think potential still need cook get level botted review would believe
make interesting less linear true open world would even better
bring beautiful character forefront really lean story
make bos mechanic feel unique fight
improve traversal
optimize performance
fix issue game underlying potential start shine thing well like character design musical score graphic beautifully cinematic moment fall flat many way genuinely ca recommend game current state
really wish purchased yet might worth playing sometime late next year
maybe inevitable wukong hit mark way one could stand ai
would refund anyone might wondering playtime keep going review like quite frankly paid game want money go waste going finish
still disappointed wukong could though
best word describe game
everything overstays welcome everything becomes chore
review tell everything need know portal thing portal exacerbate problem series struggling long much busywork
many pointless magic item collect many follower assign many dumb ai agent wandering around map pointlessly sabotaging empty deeper level victory defeat mean enough
kill greater chaos demon whatever pop back time
pivotal battle
everything come attrition minimise loss enough need spend much time recuperating therefore outpace rival race soul
think stem fact managing empire really fun total war game general certainly warhammer series
many town city conquer looking much slog enough interesting decision make constant assault much pump army march campaign side total war positioning army get jump enemy
like would war
hardly
go ambush stance rest walking one army another
could much exciting ambush involved actually plotting stealthy route intercept enemy army instead pure rng
could wall chokepoint make decision time day night make move etc
without civ great battle get repetitive darn many
ca starting turn ship around frequent hotfixes think worth playing still spectre recent absurdly dlc plenty fantastic dlc game use quality value future dlc still though think game best condition ever since release
still work done least heading right direction rough year
total war greatest achievement immortal empire campaign date
instead became greedy money grab
dont know ca new board happened series time favorite gaming franchise deeply upset direction company decided move
likely last total war ever purchase
good riddance
review changed third time far
first review made cz rifle second review made believe third last review found way bottom let give game honest wan na start saying c series fan
countless hour c cscz lul know cs
title think csgo worst explain negative experience garbage go splitting entire topic sub category community balance developer community pretty much consists main group
easter european
normal
never problem toxic annoying community however changed csgo came
mean jesus cant join casual load kid running around screaming ca play community server usually people cancer competitive cut mean like want try hard every time play get wrong find occasional good people
matchmaking game time wish never met balance okay one balance really exist game anymore
see back used ak awp deagle
everything else either situational miss click see even though gun super good one used perfectly balanced
meaning top tier gun balanced
case csgo
awp stiff asf pistol pure ptsd riffle either enough damage weird hit reg general gun balance considering smg heavy weapon jesus take gun balance csgo gun balance look brand gun balance
game type balance would reviewed death
gun balance garbage everyone remotely tell gun balance make sense wan na say saying blasphemy
developer support aug overpowered revolver pocket awp clear see valve test update like ever big company one sold game test update release mystery
even million valve received working anti cheat system good content released skin cost thousand kid africa starve
disgusting
major tournament money skin never make game gun balance developer support game awlays remain meh
little kid feed shinny fade skin
""
sorry happened csgo
recommend game
try loose faith big gaming company
review steam offered revise review additional hour played game
game still taking weird turn facing tide time
csgo one best situation c game ever beside taking simply unfair towards game gaming industry
map constantly improved gun kinda balanced lot mistake done prior
game healthier especially fooooorknight zapped kid cursed community
casual player casual need satisfied
hour game choice however choice would id hour game
c series fan always
follow major follow update change mad
watch csgo related video chip hour play time either comp casual
game waaaay better position last time gave opinion
dare say recommend
money pay able matchmaking stuff alright
game picked fire
volvo finally put elbow grease development game luckily saved shamble found
new operation dropped every
even though friend season pas type content drop concept mind keep enjoying different facet game
still find usual problem hitboxes hitreg running ak headshot etc
however thing less annoying vac actually work halfway decent nowadays
beside prime matchmaking keep lobby clean extend due overwatch etc still run cheater
said
game good
game back competition almost zapped c go gaming world
valve would tried turn game around entire valorant c go killer would become trough imagine game rich history killed arcade anime shooter
gun balance normal
even though still day negev bother actually make sense
game enjoyable
perfect gotten better thank god fortnight would still stuck actual pile garbage c go back good game nice atmosphere blast playing game found week reset bit absurd insta uninstalled untill devs rethink choice
human incredibly fun far exploration combat quest incredibly immersive easily lose time playing
plus free way near massive bonus hopefully change
downside primarily oceania server
jump ship eu play server give ping
lucky accustomed another game play know others easily feeling frustrated issue
love hop server mate decent ping even struggle connecting server like southeast asia japan
mention fact timezone force play server activity low wait eu pal wake play friend deal ping spike
massive drawback
fully ruined game low population within server list actually full another issue entirely coordinate friend day joining server late joiner
good luck finding spot server
hopefully character limit expanded upon potential oceania server introduced
overall far bump fun far
however room improvement
middle ground recommendation would click
rate yes honestly mixed
f ck cheater gamewhat happened game loved game great enjoy ca recommend
aside fact computer starting get random issue ever since played game yesterday completely shut playing game forcing reset network card first time year game encounter difficulty spike would frustrating player determined
game felt fairly easy tiger bos soul veteran bos like going fighting mouse fighting rock giant compared boss
next one follows right next kind difficulty without anything really fight upgrade game pace flowing offering craft new armor major bos get new point spend ability tree
would expect action rpg devs claim game
sudden game became soul like nowhere
enjoy soulslike game advertised one ca recommand game people enjoy difficulty encounter wall mid spending hour boss later say biggest issue game basic fighting gameplay
part added like spell really enjoyable
core gameplay combo dodging start getting repetitive spent hour getting used
start able dodge stuck combo animation real bother game like boss punish lot
animation mixed combo way slow able use really need either miss opponent cost chunk life time animation process
though get new finisher spending point ability tree none really feel interesting kinda overall definitely ca recommand getting game high price beautiful inovative enough nowaday make good game
point game fails keep player whole playthrough
come guy usually play hell kinda game
really like game
quitting
know season wipe
season wipe suck
thanks wasting time
bought prime status playing without hacker truth hacker valve higher rank hacker playing use wall hack aim hack pretend good higher lot hacker using wall hack best timing exact please update vac ban process instead stupid chicken
love complex turn based strategy game hooked
race like hour learning curve endless fun hug embarassed review used positive thought ca learnt leasson greed pay folish audacity hold game health hostage want money shameful life loved game guess gon na go play baldur gate
removed twerk update
as game
son vulkan heavy flamer heretic xenos shall cleansed sin fo existence
emperor edit love emperor fix focus enemy function imputs get character wo respond imputs
wan na shooty shot marked enemy guess titus stand lack report button pvp mind boggeling
honestly think one ever cheat game
sseth put easy good easy turn
almost hour encountered least cheater way report
edit review one time make bad review honestly want give finishing campaign maxing win heavy pvp give game overall
game look fantastic combat mid satisfying enough keep going armour weapon look extraordinary customisation behind grind wall rather ok since cosmetic actual gameplay change except multiplayer
find good story dog water absolute waste time intrigue stake bit piece writing as character dimensional yes even titus voice acting better cadians imurah space marine play even multiplayer argument still stand
sting season pas
need pay privilege grind as get ultramarine skin
know add stuff later hope buy season pas another privilege grinding as
dont understand mindset understand main gameplay pve operation pvp sop always lot currency use pve need pay currency upgrade make op
choose upgrade customisation illegal day age
mention lose pvp like gold win gold hour pvp gain gold gold enough chapter unlock dosens chapter asking hundred hour pvp pve unlock every customisation dont mind default customisation whatever season pas waste money ultramarine skin grind worth
maybe already unlocked maybe trash
rough start several update adding much needed feature compatibility previous finally say work mostly
whilst occasional bug nothing new series still run perfectly
term campaign previous game give bang buck bought sale though since one one supported updated may true future
corruption finest even deleting negative review since patch beating game best game ever near perfect performance issue fixed bad use keyboard control controller definitely required fps cap fine play controller anyway
game rushed release painfully easy see performance issue bug release date even delay original release date also reading roadmap revealed today reflects poorly release actually going come fixing issue getting basic content game early access tagged loyal consumer wait least month would call staple basic tw warhammer game blood dlc pack immortal empire mode beta time final proper release end year truly one year early access game keep lot unresolved issue getting greedy trying gouge fan go need take look upcoming chaos dwarf dlc check new dlc shadow change released soon keep gouging price dlcs low amount new content recycled know developer entire company lost plot putting official statement community phrase right discus entitlement earn playing game thing wish start capitalizing massively opportunity ip total war clown fiesta complete gazillion overpriced dlcs compensate failure hyena ongoing early accesstm total warhammer iii copy paste total war pharaoh
fun product grabbing happened try finger human mix secret world pal world camp building mechanic
lot fun barely past beta stage
still still one best game story line world pretty straight forward plot good moment combat combat actually fun lot different weapon
player free use different type gear weapon plenty opportunity experiment try new way graphic world beautiful diverse detailed without
cash shop game cosmetic
game far gear
pleasantly surprised lack usually plague type bug game early access best
voice acting fails often bug quest pop fairly often
said development team working around clock resolve many issue numerous fix released almost really like game worth time invested far
hope devs continue iron bug active refining game
basically free play relative secret world camp mechanic pet
great game watch bug
put cape took chain sword
super earth abandoned u empire emperor
game life thank ca
please make warhammer next
saw negative review privacy policy
thought read term agreement
really asking excessive personal information nothing gaming
got something like vpn play spare computer personal information used likely wo need worry trade free game
almost every single total war game dlc one
playing ca game last year
ca kill warhammer prematurely terrible sale practice never buy another game ever
business reality like stated letter business die
absolutely love total war warhammer series
fill warhammer fantasy itch table top model sooooooo expensive recent change age sigmar kinda destroyed lore
really enjoy regularly seeing update new dlc total war warhammer game faithful loving franchise fan
honour duty fear salvation craft pledge eternal truely excellent looking satisfying feeling power fantasy offer surprising amount difficulty exactly disappointment far hour content seem run bit dry sooner expected
expected game similar lasting power left dead game offered short campaign yet fun even repeating problem operation pve mission seem face real reason scour corner map well hope something cool different
yes health pickup like valuable change game way different weapon pickup adrenaline shot chainsaw gas canister defibrillator etc
seemed change thing different grenade offer tiny bit variation somewhat randomized enemy encounter term variety
even valuable thing armory data always
spot
said gameplay loop ridiculously fun trying tackle new difficulty level exciting see dropping game time soon
left wishing discover rare armor piece find little bit intrique level exploration seems meta building player dodgeroll level objective area skipping fighting anything necessary say big indication level regret fully priced purchase however bought standard edition season pas stuff truely fun time action game admittedly little bit devs adding thing gradually
hopefully concrete enough offer variety thing start getting repetitive
first impression game good
seen much yet hour grafics control combat seem nice
atmosphere good except million player shack everywhere ruin atmosphere quite bit
reduce number building per world drastically
real problem monetization completely
price item buy insane point wo spend single cent game
instead monthly sub enables get want multiple paywalls even get battlepass monthly sub
example asking set
insane
absolute maximum cost able require set like via monthly sub plus smaller thing
well even better human
fact item build base major longterm incentive keep playing farm ingame
via battlepass though dungeon boss even drop require monthly human got insane monetization overkill
battlepass
monthly sub top structural base set character skin get via sub battlepass
sorry sick boycotted predatory way monetization demotivating typical mobile game
unless reasonably priced monthly sub allows getting one structural base set character skin plus smaller furniture item skin gf wo spend single cent hour game twofold
gaming part fine
pretty much combination secret world fallout good job
monetization however appalling
got different sub whole bunch different currency gambling mechanic even sub
sick suggest spend money game come something decent less invasive greedy
game good though
would gladly pay per month sub expect full access paywalls require money
even expensive item set obtainable via currency get monthly sub item set expensive amount currency get per month game good impossible recommend due completely appalling monetization
though play game without needing money
nice move mean compensates sick way approach monetization
really fun play please please please either make healing faster give audio feedback heal button actually registered
many instance thought heal button registered nothing happens wasting lot time either double heal accident nice game would recommend love action adventure open world game challenging bos fight hardcore grinding graphic awesome combat top notch cinematography game next level kudos game science studio keep good work guy
love lore dedication emperor game
ammo health scarce time thats make fun challenging
game ok immortal empire release improved
ca recommend highly enough
ca change interaction key f e
morathi game full bug randomly make go war random faction hit turn reload game zero clue go previous save file automatically make go war
buggiest piece game completely ruined experience
game came completely ready go enjoy
think could go wrong turn take winning formula massively mess
begin major issue faction fleshed feel much like minor faction rome total old game faction balancing done terrible ai simply obliterate messed upkeep certain faction ai end silly number army right away leg difficult base game making send army realm chaos every turn higher difficulty tend single army go empire protect empire suck ai seem issue nearly getting one soul time happens without faction running roughshod everything update warhammer stop apparently army still flying territory untouchable burning city place power location terrible ogre kingdom worst really anyone fight always turn huge issue
either one around getting real chummy
minor issue great selection unique building location feeling abit spare even though warhammer ended putting make location important rather oh lost city meh one hundred village mean seriously sat decided people wanted level capped area
update put game still feel like incomplete tbh even touched side issue game far
far update score hopefully ca realised delivered shiny immortal empire update made chaos faction somewhat fleshed feel however thing game release make till much faction started get rework varies wildly faction ca seems taking blunt hammer approach development simply removing adding buff almost better ai still hold massive player bias still march army across map fight
ca appear convinced fixed evidently immortal empire map big every faction selling point really kinda wish still realm chaos though feel step backwards really
new crisis event quite interesting seeing happening think improvement update core issue still flagging hopefully update thing continue improve
revision score monkey mmm monkey
best game every played
highly recommend read story understand cut scene
ca listened toxic side community got core feature total war removed
settlement battle without additional requirement
supporting recommend supporting company ignores fan since beginning small vocal minority instead
good game need fix pc port stuttering fps loss freeze may performance still suck would expect game like sold many copy receive good support nope
basically terrarium right discus privilege entitlement earn playing game
assembly like
bigger better faster waaaaghhhh okay edit time got bug nothing major ca release hot fix pretty sharpish personally barely issue biggest gripe
major focus force chaos
whilst force chaos relatively popular force order focus help boost game gw old world
know simulating end time people get playing foc anyway allow u foo player purge wish
good game made angry heart attack fell chair rushed er
game killing horde tyranids satisfying glory imperium
must cultivate monkey monkey far surpass endless heaven evolve monkey brother another one incredible title ruined greedy practice minimal effort
thing keeping game going modding community
game almost fun lesbian scissoring idea someone release high profile game state think ok avoid give u proper pc port
ever
say game lack diversity black title finishing game achievement definitely say game life hype highly recommend playing game
course flaw shall mention overall great time playing
look amazing combat fun smooth story managed get emotional certain point
final score game performance play medium setting since ran game processor gb ram nvidia geforce gtx graphic card far ideal
right setting game ran smoothly time even medium setting still look quite good
one crash day bit stuttering prologue
issue
story take place event journey west
wo spoil event take place game end chapter get cutscenes related story chapter one done different animation style
also different ending game
path follow game part quite linear enough branching path secret area feel boring like stuck rail
environment explore course game quite varied ranging forest desert frozen lake mountain labyrinthine cave volcanic mountain
regarding exploration seen people complaining lack map personally felt lost like would required help orienting perhaps exception final chapter take place open area
biggest complaint exploration navigation invisible wall understandable since open world sometimes difficult tell something inaccessible path potential secret area
doubt bonk fence guess
issue part game action rpg challenging combat still feel lot easier opinion plenty boss fight
fact different boss mini boss encounter game different look move set yes frog boss differ elemental type even fighting worth end combat get stale
secret area chapter get item make final bos said chapter lot easier
example gain flame immunity first one cancel one ability
course acquiring item using optional prefer harder encounter still combat fluid responsive attack combo three stance transformation varied spell
skill tree generous option skill point free experimenting different build encouraged
stats resistance boosted alchemy meet certain character reallocate point whenever set give certain bonus buff various play style
equipment progression mostly linear least certain point gain option upgrade older set armor allows continue using bonus prefer
one weapon type staff spear obtained somewhat different move mini boss fight absorbed used combat one give passive buff brief transformation executes signature regarding main issue game said sometimes difficult tell whether hit invisible wall start hidden particular lot secret content accidentally missed quite frustrating completionist
game requires playing anyway want guess much issue still annoying
example unlock secret area contains missable stuff course need fight optional bos twice
first encounter bos drop piece armor needed achievement
drop item attack behind break arm
accidentally kill bos unable obtain item final complaint matter want drop rate seed armor piece bit low opinion
sure depends rng luck spent full day trying farm last type seed needed seed sow achievement
wearing item boost drop rate
reason alone give instead like would otherwise deserve
best space marine game doom eternal men
happy international primate day

poor value money
update break previous paid dlc go unfixed month get fixed
get together ca
detta är super skojigt one best game played life
miss
rating good introduction global offensive first person shooter set comptetetive scene two team battle objective
famous mod terrorist battle different location
gameplay story gameplay consists buying weapon shooting opponent
easier said done actually since opponent either human player sitting side world wide web ai programmed shoot first
c go reason biggest competetive shooter market year since offer great weapon balance tactical possibility team approach large player base keep growning day
story behind game based oldschool game one side take approach terrorist either trying plant bomb protect hostage either try protect bomb site trying rescue hostage held terrorist base
combat challenge combat absolutely fluid c go barely moment could blame broken hitboxes bad netcode dying
people tend rage blame bad balance map weapon programming game however success title prof best competetive shooter market
challenge game definetely able rise rank competetive match playing hacker opposite team player team want teach bad word russian french
always thankful opportunity improve language skill consider chance becoming even better win match matter team stack
reaching global elite rank around hour safely say possible rise top even odds stacking
graphic interface graphic set higher setting actually pretty good sadly competetive scene barely allows since certain trick like setting resolution lower purpose able aim better crash feeling game graphical matter
map contain detail make distinguishable like certain grapphiti map
interface kept simple almost transparent disturb concentration
progress possible consider progress rising account level come simply playing c go form form rising ranking playing competetive gathering skin weapon using want sell
people actually make money playing game selling skin steam market different way progress outside game
biggest progress improving coordination playing competetively
audio immersion weapon sound unique since sound play great role game really important get know sound able distinguish shooting coming
c go fulfills task really well
music played menues highlight
game music nothing special since music kit fit music taste valve found good workaround creating amazing music
game offer single player multiplayer mode played either player game offer different mode fun example gun mode others played game contains steam game offer great optimization update technology time updating network code updating hit box balancing weapon
summary c go reason number one fps esl scene popularity currently rising
great see abandoned developer reaching peak state still keep getting updated
would recommend trying c go every game know game defines global fps market much fps fan might love might well get turned hardcore player cursing spitting hope review help making decision worth buying installing game
rate leave comment enjoyed reading introduction completed game last week hour recently actually completed game reaching max level maxing important gear important spirit found every secret found still thing maxing every reaching according people stats enemy actually cap etc
tested various build pretty much gave everything disposal try wanted writing honest first wanted give game negative review right start reason lying come system requirement
rig laptop pc installed first laptop even tho everything recommended system setting got fps first area higher area rt minimum setting fsr way handle game anything fps certain area
installed pc decided play game see hype start first negative lie system requirement would say would need least enjoy decent framerate
rng drop game really really bad sure ignored plan game missing certain item lack mean move faster exploring get transformation near end chapter spell chapter wan na spoil allows move faster use chapter first bad play game especially going feel frustrated overall slow pace large boss game janky hitboxes enemy attack go terrain general lack direction chapter open world chapter disorienting pretty much negative think let debunk common negative criticism game receiving combat basic boring light attack heavy attack
hear anyone saying know played game hour opinion irrelevant either mental capacity understand basic mechanic game
light heavy attack sure also staff spin attack thrust parry spell parry counter attacking heavy time perfectly dodge perfect dodge skill let go invisible counter immobilize immobilize perfect dodge timing perfect cast clone later coordinated attack different stance different heavy attack basic one change secret one spirit massive one hit multiple hit spirit spirit heal spirit depending current light attack phase different combo apply debuffs freezing poisoning shocking setting enemy fire use vessel keep combo going various transformation disposal unique weapon combo
like literally almost infinite combo know required item dodge parry focus massive hit run literally go full nuke one shot pretty much anything even risking get stack elemental debuffs enemy literally play anyway want
sure lot weapon variety get stave spear playing wukong expect twinblades game literally game probably amount unique boss far single player game literally everywhere make bos rush game people say either understand mean hate wan na positive graphic soundtrack simply really shine game soundtrack game probably best boss game ever sheer quantity unique boss nothing short amazing take thing next level almost boss incredibly fun play except large one bc janky hitboxes offer good challenge varying degree difficulty easy hard hard depending playstyle experience videogames general
literally perfect balance quantity quality story really good really stood way presented everything served platter lot key information presented form subtle hit dialogue mostly secret boss quest animation get finish every chapter
relationship various character game absolutely figure small spoiler ahead enemy actually ally brother test guide game obtain certain item access certain area become stronger lover never mentioned time game etc animation end chapter stayed true source material managing add twist tale wukong without butchering material instead enhancing combat really good figure
real combat tutorial map quest indicator quest journal tooltip basic lot hidden map arena boss item people miss
ofc make people mad game saying stuff like combat basic capacity figuring stuff game let explore figure everything good game experience hit differently figure stuff make game many time great replayability well polished hour playthrough writing review bug encountered enemy attack would phase mtx final verdict overall give game recommend getting game however come buyer beware lie system requirement would say need least even unsure gon na get constant fps guess figure pretty fast always refund

hacker everywhere update game still suck product refunded tl dr solo player beware much game balanced intended played group despite option solo
least friend bring sure experience enjoyable fun otherwise would stay away announce significant improvement ai
aware private lobby either later month seems way operation solo either moment
ca speak anything pvp interest wanted like game really really wanted like game warhammer cool looking forward month hell game look good seemed well optimized sure blast friend everyone saying current status solo play absolutely atrocious
ai companion behavior follows help kill noticeable amount enemy often peppering various enemy swinging often stray far titus waste time random fodder likewise objective require defense never bother defend
habit leaving executable enemy alive supposed let player come gain armor always done player armor like foot away thanks behavior still dealing active mob get annoying deal draw aggro horde
even front titus often get skipped leaving entire swarm designed separate people
player deal sole purpose time come revive get downed thanks anything else
way limited revives fun seeing checkpoint
least backtrack far one worst companion ai seen pve game
even price tag hype behind never gon na expect create something could feel like legit player wow ridiculous
really bad keep mind veteran difficulty game state intended difficulty
yes yes know lower difficulty absurdly easy level probably tap everything try stick listening story
gameplay like reason picked game
story sure interesting enough group pushing game simply gripping enough warrant neither slowly dragging foot horde easy creature challenge play intended difficulty higher suffer two basically ai ally
boss also seem intended challenge deal would fun least see take good try suck wont get around thanks dying due lack defense swarmed generally left dead thing note developer people created world war z game seemingly notorious ai also awful hmmm point someone zero interest modern pvp wan na get kicked lobby constantly generally leave much fun randoms said lobby ultimately lobby coming later month seems probably allow solo operation dev poor ai record wwz game course pve mission pick moment really bode well
want proven wrong badly want experience become smoother regardless many play
right
definitely buck least
would hope top priority adjusting ai considering treated primarily multiplayer game currently gon na hold breath leave whether worth buck mean many cheaper game offer significantly playtime assuming dabble pvp get tired mission could probably squeeze hour depending finally get tired
think foundation much improved really suck getting proper replayable pve horde mode year
oh well make improvement companion review start glowing go back switch positive
hell significantly better maybe even pick try point leave disappointed

yes product received free best game learn bad wordsfor example russian
really taking time game ca ignore start super strong kinda fall apart second half
time hit chapter narrative start lose coherency unless diehard journey west scholar sense creative fight design window replaced scammy gimmick designed nerf progression force basic play tool dodge light attack riddled minor bug play mostly unperturbed extra exploration effort towards inevitably slam bugged quest line bos fight
straight sloppy game presenting aaa experience ubisoft finish game better saying something
hard say buy game since first half strong fence best advice wait patch
worthwhile survival gameplay freeenjoy least chinese developer decides make drop development future done lot game
time tell
said oncehuman right awesome survival game
sort mmo cross nightingale left dead
create hive warbands play together play solo still ton seem pretty reliable right playing gaming community live na
eu server still fairly responsive
huge plus
impressed experienced absolutely stutter hiccup yet
played others around massive party group impressed game performance
run gaming rig gtx expecting sort good performance
turned aa shadow set vfx medium
run smooth vsync resolution system
kudos devs game perform well gameplay planning playing hour since thing launch day
could stop playing ended foregoing task play evening long
really enjoyable addictive
coming rather grumpy gamer choosy play
progression beginning first two tier seems balanced feel like grind
sure become grind intuitive key binding need work
ok f interaction usually remap thing like q shift sprint nice bothered find way toggle yet sure possible
sprinting reduces stamen
meter shared mining chopping tree fan
able craft vehicle explore driving around fun gas usage really need turned quite love feel game environment along looting junk deconstruct basic
mob easy fight others bit annoying
flying mob pain
really see need base defensive structure yet nothing attacking base
may later progression pvp
playing pve server long chaos worry pvp
pvp server pvp hit level base fairly sometimes orienting piece fit painful
fortunately fly mode move freely make placement easier
still fitment piece restricted thing work well together handle edge overlap fine
first roofing get fugly get better later
also good give absolutely lighting option early interior get quite dark even minute queue login selected server launch day even get create customize character customization insane amazing level detail
hopefully queue wait improve especially since server listed mid population server
server number pve pvp prefix rather dull tell community server
would nice server split region global regional yet seamless zone
picking regional server intro video vague horrible job job providing back story current world state thing
get worse nothing explaining reason moving different
term including deviant star dust star fall rift etc
terminology stolen ip seem special back story meaning game
apparently collect nourish equip sort butterfly help along way getting advice talking bird visually annoying
frustrating aspect character replied npc dialog speech feigned head movement gesture even though npc speaking decent audio sum story weird dialog sloppy disjointed explanation purpose
gameplay addictive fun
network game client performance excellent
yet
developer top addressing feedback complaint like giving u ability create one character
chinese developer poor history abandoning game along questionable privacy policy overlooked way thing progressed human far
since free really worthwhile experience

people interested warhammer
expensive edition buy regular review loved first space marine actually beat last week first time anticipation marine leaf awe amazing environment look
horde stunning give oh feeling realize hundred tyranids running towards backdrop actual enemy gameplay mechanic questionable
execution replenish armor instead health unlike first game make sense point view campaign really pull moment frustrates
fact fully die restart previous checkpoint reset downed limit
mean got bos fight left better let bos kill restart fight reset also fan limited weapon slot
previous game pistol primary two slot big gun
game pistol primary occasional big gun pick drop want switch others
left wishing picked another gun primary specific bos bug encountered soft block mission luckily checkpoint right reloaded lose progress
checkpoint game generously game great fan gameplay mechanic make frustrating play higher difficulty
played veteran difficulty second highest intended one devs wonder people even frustrated highest dr space marine great game fan likely leave frustrated due handful gameplay design choice really piss
standard edition worth waste money
sigmar approves game amazing game highly recommend everyone
like ign useless game journo go woke go broke rest assured somewhere people still making great game worthy money
fps xd fps ping lot people seem performance issue far none game crashed yet despite intense actively addressing performance issue page suggested fix far although idk work since need
blame people leaving bad review think game unplayable current state know ca far aware least always fixed sort issue usually fairly quick
less like every total war game since shogun
look past done lot work improve gameplay aspect
siege battle actually fun
large fortress themed faction hold
sieging black fortress ogre fun total war game far
ai seems intelligent especially battle tactic used warhammer ii seem trick ai anymore
new mechanic regarding war target ally warfare cool diplomacy system ui overhauled pretty neat
loading turn actually surprisingly fast least opposed started playing warhammer ii new turn press would like second loading
really good game
simple yet complex time
first time player let game recoil mechanic scare away
take time get used great community compared game engine mean player gmod c etc

authorize company make game bois
beat as heaven court mf
cancerous game completely russian occupation full trick ca get money time loss effort
expensive properly fix expensive rate seems like ca finally started making improvement fix example game constant slugfest desync randomly popping still enough creator taking account rather controversial behaviour
additionally game still requires attention
ai campaing battle absurdly stupid right
see game way right get go leave steep way ahead ca
greedy banned server token skin plugin private passworded server
gave month cooldown lose rank lovely
instead listing bad thing list good thing game fun time maybe find friend russian let list bad thing matchmaking system joke rank boost ego idiot many people actually decent ca play friend stick elo hell lot booster cheater amazing play game get as handed afks guy hr skin quality meme banning server malicious plugins eg
skin changer kind hypocritical considering loophole considering ton undetected skin changer hard make one either vac joke thing ban ayyware
tick server especially consider c game nearly decade old tick server mainly cause ran autists like valve weapon spread inaccuracy joke way setup recoil
lower rank harder play higher one smurfs maybe exception lem supreme global bazillion case update still ca start local server without using casual changing setting
netcode interpolation par payday

sense developer trying best win back good fan
warhammer thoroughly recommend game buy yet
lot fun
ign first big reviewwhere start
game literally awesome find single thing would bother make gameplay simple love easily move whole house new place wo lose single thing
actual release also lot furniture material wall believe add lot also love simply move object place wrong example chest move simply higher location sometimes bit hard place something many ore tree nearby need clear first order buildcombat fun little bit mix ghost reacon resident evil camera view movement
could weapon tho
finisher perfect also brutality weapon damage satisfying horror open world game want bit weapon unique material gathering starter player bit confusing time see pretty simple need mine lot material start also like progressing
ca mine high tier material basic tool need literally play put effort reward
huge many many unique deviant combat territory
many cute many terrifying make also good effort track gain many
pretty simple understand also pretty simple use ca say many monster exactly really get far yet met many interesting mini boss mimic took breath away
zombie beginning bit repetitive since basic enemy fine
hope add also terrifying monstersservers sometimes little lag sometimes lag due rendering would say stablecosmetics much starter item look really awesome wonderful
must admit cooking cosmetic
ready give wallet also find open world looting lucky enoughworld event event pretty original say saw game also player event brings many good vibe count pve server ca kill unless event pvp zone find one event pvp stock tier paper destroy easily say made reality wo say word
upgrading tier make significant difference simply tune vehicle enough material use cosmetic well
could something like tune garage exactly customize want got ta little detail someone gon na hate simply remove modification
would great add something like tree ca say word perfection friend even better ranking progressing higher tier starting lot difficult obtain new skill cost need find way farm energy point easily skill tree boss side quest journey task note thing found missing perspective playing friend another friend wanted join could drop weapon gear even find way drop
normal stuff like drink food tool drop ca drop weapon final review would recommend game
yesis good friend
hell yesis boring hour
nope fun asf
game good bad part crash time time emperor plan great game support widescreen monitor
new dlc overpriced year playing game felt like game dead came across old man matchmaking told enjoy game son
like time wanted turn back time see wonderful old life game made smash everything house scream top voice saw someone carrying auto sniper circling around hit face sure game died
emperor
good game overhyped right discus privilege entitlement earn playing game
assembly even computer play
ca change
write lot review bottom game loaded reason play player never feel ashamed play want game varies whatever build use hundred hour content sink
game player hoped way
nope kinda fun tbh damn coming hour pvp extremely disappointed favorited chat
adding higher price taking away feature give updated negative review love total war warhammer game played one really buggy right paid literally
started prolouge ca really finish bug example ca end turn maze bruh
honestly big red later maybe change mind
bad job guy bad job
like rust without toxic community
like division hybrid monster
fan stranger thing upside aesthetic
starry studio game
game genuinely great game
rarely bug
good graphic
game play addicting
studio majority mobile game actually insane work deserve praise
triple studio take note game better way less resource ask
start care providing rather cash grab
great job game science masterpiece
chainswordbolt pistoljetpackred paint blood angel chapter symbolsdose havemicro transactionssummaryblood chalice vengance sangunius
game crashed time game product received free kkkd edit greatest sequel game ever
expectation absolutely destroyed hype excitement future game world
wholeheartedly recommending single person love warhammer
surprised experience
perfect
course
flawed masterpiece
yes totally
warhammer fan ca speak tell perfect gateway drug friend highly recommended
emperor apart game hanging around second best warhammer game ever played
best game ca taking nice piss mouth
leaving review negative reverse moronic dlc decision
finger hole please bring bloodborn steam fromsoftware also game like as getting whooped
launch game problematic many patch recent change ca behavior recommend game best trilogy finally satisfying faction immersive
even ai getting better
boss could arguably rest game think nioh little bit god war little bit hack n whatever gaming life play masterpiece embrace enjoy keep playing whatever china
graphic forget reality look long gameplay watch paint dry audio deaf audience grandma pc requirement check run rich ask nasa spare computer difficulty press easy learn hard significant brain dark soul grind nothing u care necessary average grind much need second life grinding story replace life game time long enough cup infinity beyond price free worth u spare money could also burn money bug never heard minor get ark survival game big terrarium bug
aside air wall sometimes camera angle everything perfect graphic music combat culture story line need research limit based single journey west also refers different version chinese mythology
reformed orthodox rabbi bill clinton pc version barbones
lack basic feature like ultrawide support simple vsync toggle
emperor
game extremely boring
dropped within week
set piece bos fight simply sublime hitting right note truly memorable epic art direction unique world cinema wukong probably delivers best showpiece ever featured video notch visuals high quality well paced considering game massive packed content plenty secret never fails surprise chapter advance
feel satisfying progress intro outros chapter see may pretty much empty space obtuse level design resulting poorly rewarded exploration lot empty space serf purpose besides making area looking bigger
also frustrating placement invisible wall kinda funny bc look like know close area using environment using wall rock tree etc leading badly placed invisibile wall also went nut widening ground space game slow traversal stamen consumption running mostly populated uninteresting loot
feel like game simply shine brighter focused tightly designed level example chapter wasteland felt like slog chapter get bored death snow section frozen enemy
chapter felt much better play
tree unlockables underwhelming
skill variety great upgrade kinda probably hit nonsensical know nothing journey kinda fails properly communicate system mechanic stuff player long clue combat lacking time sometimes look like enemy moving limb around animation actually poorly visually communicated attack get hit
also feel like sometimes aim realistic accurate illumination lead bad visual clarity combat happens lot exploring place outside bos camera clunky fighting tight space helpful taking multiple enemy engaging personal opinion think able openly cancel attack would wonder open combat fun factor specially base light combo using time throughout whole game
light attack flurry get old pretty fast using lot
unlocking spear mid game felt like bit fresh air sole fact change basic light attack take inspiration soul title lean lot character action game come combat may turn people expected next closest thing software game made another studio
actually wukong thing really soulslike feel like character action game rpg element mean steal turn combat multiple tool available instead waiting feel like grounded bayonetta devil may cry god war instead dark soul approach method
plus lose nothing upon dying
hand exploration traversal feel pretty much like soul title lacking finesse find software game least great overall feel kinda unpolished time system combat lacking level design yeah look pretty af grandiose set piece respectfully creative art direction truly amazing bos fight
still impressive studio first output league western developer trying aaa gaming refreshing see triple single player title thriving well sea disconnected live service game flopping hard trying next fortnite overwatch whatever especially coming brand new studio despite flaw good stuff highly recommended
fun
like dark soul dark soul edit latest dlc fantastic

otherwise avoid
support kind behaviour
short version pro amazing stellar location landmark brimming enemy exploration feel responsive satisfying outstanding amount ton replay epic superb splendid voice challenging bos fightscons limited janky horse combat could better long version elden ring rpg developed fromsoftware inc published bandai namco entertainment
ambitious game attempt bring dark soul formula open world really enjoyed dark soul iii never sort person would always wait massive sale
elden ring remember watching reveal trailer thinking huge open world
grown tired ubisoft formula lost interest immediately
fortunately gameplay video came looked glorious decided give ended one favorite game time like fromsoftware title elden ring approach story play tarnished quest become elden lord
get introduced event character journey must rely side mission item description character dialogue know world
might discourage player found whole setting story epic
holy look stunning
screenshot elden ring good guy nick elden ring gameplay core gameplay loop remained untouched go checkpoint checkpoint called site grace game disposing enemy way earning rune currency allocating numerous stats increase plethora thing like hp mana stamen immunity die lose rune must go back pick
die getting however gone good
every time rest site grace item come back enemy respawn feel way better responsive dedicated jump button
additionally ride swift nimble horse named torrent quickly travel huge open site grace rest level also allow quick travel also revisiting area always encouraged always useful item gear around also received feel responsive
still myriad option come weapon armor focus sword whip stave crossbow shield name standard attack also activated ability add versatility mix
sheer amount personalization present awesome
pick absurd amount armor talisman mixing matching different sort weapon
option combo relentless ever feel super satisfying slay
might feel impossible beat always something different approach take different weapon maybe coming back always something elden ring
open world nature game allows visit whichever area desire
might end killing might also find new weapon upgrade material make strong
might sword player
personality loved
managed find spot considerably easy opponent beat worth lot rune
visit area managed level great deal time felt quite overpowered good portion story mode
thankfully lot side quest boss put back place killing repeatedly
elden ring screenshot elden ring good guy nick two aspect gameplay must touch start horseback combat fine feel like could better
told friend really depends kind weapon carrying make sense time camera get way lock onto target whole combat aspect always feel bit janky unsatisfying
certainly cheese boss riding torrent get skilled become experienced think enjoyable regular final feature want mention online
present think poorly implemented
summoning player might always work trouble finding friend
finally got play together summoned player would always return world someone dy defeating bos
see people enjoy would loved able complete story friend sent back every time kill bound single location playing game summons wall fog prevent going area
ride horse either could say due technical limitation day age think obviously actually prefer playing game part adventuring epic world friend employing different strategy overcome amazing boss sound terrific get small portion serve pvp component elden ring fine
happen often disable entirely nice
game also includes invasion give extra challenge face
elden ring screenshot elden ring good guy nick always say dark soul game great graphic feature stellar art direction
well elden ring graphic absolutely stunning art direction flawless
environment distinct masterfully exude feeling beauty peace rot desperation sometimes time

gameplay great visuals breathtaking sense scale legendary score enjoyed review please consider following curator page
greed shortsighted go suck mama ca
story love game solid story
game based chinese mythological story called journey west
actually spoke many chinese people see knew every one
seems massive story doubt game done great job showing someone chinese hard time telling happening
good understood really understand
could relate certain event happening
said like chinese mythology
knew character erlang shen sun wukong obviously
also saw scene ne zha others liked even though know type game usually clunky control system actually smooth play
default control perfect never felt unnatural use
camera view never really issue either
think issue one point game
certain bos last chapter
multiple hit box reason game automatically switched hitbox looking
quite frustrating keep taking main way attacking staff
melee attack straight forward
different stance change thing little bit much
simple learn
spell add nice addition combat
use change play style bit
honest even use many
certain one suited play style
big selection transformation well also nicely play wukong lore many transformation
one provides different play style limited time
healing game frustrating part
take sooooo long use heal
understand play difficulty boss aggressive really ca get moment finish healing animation simply beautiful
might one best looking game
time pc ran game full spec
one issue
game requires ram minimum also required amount
going say need
game literally us
chapter get frame drop certain area reason going take point audio expect really good
area atmosphere filled perfectly audio
audio cue game might think first letting know something nearby
even pick second
dodge enemy attack listening audio design call type game git gud game
ca push way
difficult
boss really seem bad let guard get bos kill much
one bos chapter died around time sure
stay level headed beat
play passive play style aggressive
play style better different game enjoyable
managed play
boss frustrating point enjoying
start finish great time playing
ca wait dlc come
good production value roof love presentation music vo anims fire stuffreally bad playing solo campaign veteran barely get set piece without dying time skill issue
play game see combat looking great derpy afwill talk core hope see hear really like game combat make hard love
edit review switch thumb combat fixed super tilted sloppy combat game
getting pummeled range cover suck dodge ninja
range damage hella lowered
busy dealing problem cqc
wan na pepper fine
improve health return mechanic maybe less issue fun getting peppered relentlessly scrum
realize maybe realistic video game parry need cancel current action take priority move except executes aka glory kill need generous direction timing
hoard dude crawling butt
may realistic feel good video game wise doom eternal super well glory kill
matter reloading scratching nut press glory kill glory kill
executes already game parry well find parrying even blue circle
let parry work like arkham game
number time sword guy attack parry game derp get hit anyway massively aggravating
could spamming attack spam attack blue circle attack anim ca parry
fighting game misreads punished
let player parry
animation look sick want spam shot follow freakin day game let self heal glory kill white health
white health last like second
get rid white health dumb
executes self heal
let u tank range damage getting pummelled melee scrum
medkits saved ranged encounter executes available armor weird make little sense
make one bar get rid
remember needing even sure except go away quickly never come back
mission set piece seem designed set piece mechanic b horde melee c ranged minion
solo use different weapon time
example rat fight ca shoot flame thrower ranged drone damn sword guy time
moment swap plasma rat turbine trip ground damage
like need play mission solo go man sure seems like cheap player love exacerbating problem number time see ai teammate standing take pot shot baby tyrannid set piece mission objective going smoke made put game
rat mission drone need taken rat keep bay
since ai ca bothered use flamethrower got ta keep rat bay
ai buddy
shooting rat
either make effective helping make set piece stuff make sense solo actually love lot game want play combat poor combat encounter design leaf much desired right game frustrating
rip social life b
spending day lifetime playing game think time deleted salty middle waste time favor find something less time wasting
goty
video game one favorite
definitely try game help step fascinating world never
myth game reveal essence chinese year culture profound epic try
miss
rewarding exploration
sometimes difficulty spike annoying realize need git gud
open world allows explore level finally felling difficult need fixing good amount session end connection error
work fun whether friend stranger need previous software game
good game valve dont care cheating
clearly cheating people casual match
noiceedit never install trash game
feel like second match pure pain
think know difference good player people life wisdom waste lifetime play go
campaign amazing
capture universe amazingly well really feel like could boot space marine
feel good good weight action
grittiness darkness universe shown online game fall lot
hoping super engrossing pvp combat look somewhere else two version online
pve pve pretty good
like integrated main campaign smart decision feel like still seeing part campaign even finished
cool way
unfortunately mission promised added via season pvp though thing start get bad
obviously focus game feel tacked still thing
going game wanting focus pvp feel like going lack map
think
""
hopefully come season lack game mode
standard team deathmatch mode three point try control earn point another mode one point rotates control point
""
hopefully come season pas lack balance
even sure approach
bulwark invincible due shield way around come massively op class stunlocks grappling get frustrating fairly
look get person game really annoying killed around corner someone ca even see even though looking direction
see ca see definitely get game campaign play
decent length mission pretty long
pve portion game great
pvp portion
pve alone say recommended maybe sale
emperor
great game
amazing potential
long time much fun game like
steam offered write review c go
c go played could say gabe almighty like play game reviewing
game perfect every aspect
""
best part game finally uninstall realize much time could spent elsewhere
product refunded type game poor execution
look awesome run meh
marketed soul game yet one
like soul game ignore
played
figured game awful
wish could refund
social credit skyrocketing right game loyal predecessor gameplay story game issue much added gameplay wise since still enjoyable liked first cutscenes amazing story simple familiar lore easily appreciate detail went environment character though fov slider believe totalbiscuit would proud bell lost soul toll
exceed expections even game
perfect every way
ofc much room grow mechanic really make viable vocal never introducing feature
long doesnt happen game banger free even friend play
spent hour trying get controller work game
ended using xbox controller work game original controller still wo pick
devs fixed character creation issue within hour
w devs praise frame wary connection required ahead
honestly truly opinion advice give try finger upgrade review please purchase reviewer end sarcasm dlc
start new game something different time still finish game knight sword shield
like
wish bigger hole monke ca really amazing game amazing mechanic
love art character faction unit presented u well
hoping least good well better
ca wait see game grow fully develop
addictive ton thing
despite primarily shooter usually steer away element mmo addition open world base see ton player home vehicle really make game feel alive
guild dungeon boss really fun mechanic big small event map require big group absolute ton decoration style furniture home including plushies
farm crop flower go fishing bug issue addressed far enjoying game much recommend everyone even build base farm decoration create greatest farm ever veggie flower dedit phase ton fun content forward
finding phase unlocks lacking see less player around
fine sadly get greedy take break day grinding hour take house completely scrapped
thanks thanks stupid mention plethora major issue
could care less free game still product marketed consumer yes absolutely bash free game
bought c go year ago replaced
ikea never came house away replace black chair yellow armchair thought better update different product put purchase back library
huge amount content big variability playing large number weapon spell special ability weapon customization terrain goat recycling past soul game well hitboxes inconsistent processing damage low invention almost procedure element known previous gameselden ring old famous soul game open world
good bad quality soul game came together great game soul replaced rune protagonist tarnished ashen world lack word normal existence story ignored player
player ability destroy dozen specie plethora weapon fighting style time large number spell special weapon ability using summoned ashen helper npc coop friend
boss bog number sometimes repeat combine game fails work multiple player summon make much easier world fascinating area well designed time within big world recycling repetitive place building much news probably largest creature similar mountain goat main character ride finally jumping
player longer stop boulder jumping also become significant element level design
respawns really time around although annoying pity many invention took place within leveldesign ladder door elevator basically enhanced teleports maybe next time nice kind interaction environment destruction junk satisfactory player easily get lost map help orientation ability insert mark possibility teleportation fire beginning software brought really good game enjoyed never played game everything new fascinating
however old player game many surprise f still brings extensive action changing review ca review dlc price policy
good sequel already great gamesingleplayer good hour real replay value cinematic always make authenticpve enjoyable mission player mid fight show true battle get boring pretty fast new mission addedpvp cheater haha easy anti cheat reason even avoid either get put team said sweat dominate enemy team get put team people even fire back bot probably alright problem game relies almost entirely dodging using ability temporary invulnerable state
like elden ring mystery delay attack probably
monkey king hit like wet noodle leaving high health enemy fight boring hp
ability largely nice one reliable way ensure damage
temporary invulnerable state unlock early incredibly underwhelming
guide indicate damage significant even status effect triggered little add fight except giving extra health bos fight devolve slapping build meter stunning releasing one button damage case interest largely useless forgettable save passive buff
well less useless using double trigger input execute hit miss
issue control something else altogether looking type b control sometimes spin weapon instead sprinting enemy level nothing prepare upcoming bos
completely unrelated
advantage learning deal enemy attack level bos nothing enemy encountered
fact except farming experience run right
additionally enormous gap enemy difficulty bos difficulty
spam simple attack get enemy level punished thing consumables easy miss
granted matter later game even loot small slightly twinkling container contains useful item
map hard remember anything backtrack search missed expect much way explanation
though thing unlock progress mechanic whose importance understated often lead boring attack pattern
main mechanic damage wet noodle spam build dot icon poorly explained charge attack release hit stunned
except spending exorbitant amount time memorizing bos pattern time reliably hit charged attack stun long cool limited graphic incredible item description include fun story somewhat related ability really want like truth keep quitting reloading bad sign
mechanic poorly implemented enough leave game frustration exactly aside money invested encouraging play game
like game close greatness stumble execution
throw boss multiple time find noticeable reason time lost several time previously
feel like rolling dice
need play wandering wight time encounter slam attack understand one go sale
like dodge die mechanic probably end frustrated
one best single player strategy game
insane amount content replayability dlcs immortal empire map
corporate shill ruined game monke see
monke atacknot really kind game got hooked really good
think actually accessible anybody grind way higher level still able progress even u suck kind game
incredible good job one mokey stick hurt bad guy
like
well thou art passing skill
warrior blood must truly run thy vein tarnished game garbage
ready come rewriting global offensive really cheap embarrassing
preface devoted game year many hour invested franchise
game put allows people kill without able see due poor planning
replace tick server
might accurate come actually shot first feel horrible user end
game need fixed moment look like scheme make money returning player buying skin
create game experience feel good user
praise ccp violent diabolical dangerous beast slayer conqueror conqueror goat goat ultimate needle mover god mode head table otc tribal chief
wukong banana master
recent patch caused significant stuttering
best thing happened year v ca beat free
quite literally pretty much everything game battle pas micro transaction primarily cosmetic nothing game breaking
honestly went lowest expectation surprised much development went game released free
inappropriate activity detected steam deck linux proton please hotfix asap p ca even beat grafted scion first bos tutorial hour later still ca beat
first game steam really like
friend recomended play almost time game great single player potential even better multiplayer devs really need fix bug since release back fun game ever played bar none
varied battle system rich storyline made simply unable stop
think better design fact failing thing gained still
allow still get bos failure keep challenging knowing trigger new also played different feeling think wukong really good game far free play game go really good base lot potential
devs listen player iron thing could definitely end pretty damn good
recognize asset nothing wrong
use many one
real complaint lack controller support
really lame
may play around ui little well order controller feel natural
great start though
among best fromsoft made peak favourite area fight fromsoft made issue later game like godskin duo example
denuvo
game hard make hard desperately need fov recommend avoiding fixed fov sensitive make largely unpleasant please get rid necessity hold button acknowledge message prompt terrible design decision
great game need vampire content though
good game part
part hate siege battle boring annoying slog
happen rather often
immortal empire pretty ok original campaign
wish could turn improved siege battle without mod though
kind make better summarycampaign hour loreful hack n slash fun
pve fun friend undercooked linear clunkypvp fun friend bare bone unbalanced recently replayed space marine sequel much better game
visuals sound feel spot space marine fantasy
however quite achieve everything set secondary mode fall short similar game
campaignthis much story writing reminiscent black library novel
good bad top sclock bravado action machismo expect
grim reality imperium acknowledged whole lean closer glorification critique
gameplay continuation first game mechanic feel chainswords plasma gun feeling suitably impactful
highly linear without meaningful choice little exploration
combat oriented straight point astarte would grown wearisome campaign longer
scripted execution similarly timed stay interesting right end campaign perhaps much obvious missed opportunity
like vehicle level placeholder cutscenes let control terrain destruction happens around ca actually change
also quite short ten hour race perhaps take time play optional mission overall enjoyable romp couple day pve bulk end game replayability customisation please many tabletop fan
however key limitation
visual depth gunplay darktide endless variety replayability vermintide left dead
much linear experience replay map
get variety different class upgrade progression largely cosmetic minor stat buff
beyond limited number map skill enemy also pretty limited number weapon quite slot single option
likely get dozen hour fun maybe hundred
repetition thing like execution animation started show campaign become clear repeated play throughs level
roadmap content let hope enough pipeline keep juice throwback different kind multiplayer back day unreal tournament halo lan party
low time kill strong reliance team coordination
three map three game mode replayability limited content availability
pvp fun play launch crew together may struggle drag people away hero shooter mobas world long term
conclusionthis fun brutal distraction dozen hour
realisation childhood fantasy others gateway addiction know wanted
great entry set warhammer game worthy sequel fun game
wo revolutionise industry show going back basic delivering fan want sound strategy good time
aaa game released
optimized worth money ask
thank god sweet baby inc dei get hand
soaking wet end game miyazaki san greatest cook time 𝘎𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵 𝘨𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘳𝘶𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘣𝘺 𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘴
well beaten exactly hour span week think give penny thought
elden ring great scope world expansive daring fromsoft challenge comparison previous game
say nailed world pretty fun find wandering finding meaningful content loot quest lore course fan see still game reluctant playing however say give shot see like
various way tackling elden ring spend time exploring getting stronger making thing accessible choose tackle legacy dungeon area traditional soul game enjoy way
every way choose tackle elden ring valid let anyone else tell also pvp done hour well mixed experience especially player spamming build moonveil river blood katanas soul level
perhaps find better experience pvp later people experiment game also glaring issue performance worst offender even patch
running rig quite recommended setting game love dip frame half capped
get incredibly frustrating fighting bos frame decide tank making vulnerable hit possibly ending run
happen often happens noticeable
another thing say pain as camera many time fight damn camera since love adjust automatically especially fighting giant boss torrent mount
frustrating issue previous fromsoft game bloodborne setting turn two main issue game fixable think enjoyable game good newcomer fromsoft soul game
definitely worth got rig
fun git course ranni best girl
dodge parry enthusiast
monkey changing positive time
acknowledgement ca former error pricing communication
new dawi dlc great far besides grudge bug fixed mod proper hotfix arrives played tw hour bought every dlc sadly step back almost every direction around hour revisit icing cake recent dlc price increase statement ca clearly showing lost touch player base

immortal empire campaign far looking excellent
looking forward seeing game

someone like base building task stay home refine thing support friend go raidingthe worldbuilding excellent
love mechanism game deviation world event
really appreciate game waste time arbitrarily mmos run
talk person
carry letter next person
fetch item chest

also love pricing model
unlike many game focus making basic gameplay annoying get pay game perfectly playable baseline allows pay cosmetic item
buy thing flex buy thing cool feel predatorythis game area could improve
cause pc fan kick high gear
lag spike occasionally though really bad game sometimes take several minute load world seemingly reason
menu optimised ex ca click refill salt meat dehydrator manually select right number
building little clunky
getting item placed properly bit strugglebut
small issue tbhoverall tonne fun game ca wait experience
really see becoming mainstay mainstream gaming care planet stand long die
named space marine nice game cheater good way spend hr life developer finger fetish
good many technical issue terrible fps probably hold purchase decent bug fixing patch
game hard punishing dark boss difficulty sometimes varies button mash dodge succeeded killing bos first try ca dodge right time wasted window opportunity attack die relentless attack bos low health want play game anymore map breathtaking view level design better sometimes invisible wall idea go next far like explore every inch map

well game decides crash nowhere bos health bit annoying yeah
already
even lower one amınakodumun oğulları
fact two previous game play one fully complete still bought though funded hyena buying garbage
despite serious issue recommend early review thus might change later right game barely releaseable state
keep mind total war release often messy least total war warhammer game patched improved current main issue
look game look worse campaign barely run medium setting
pc run campaign high graphic setting average fps
pitty texture constantly popping battle campaign map blurry
minor major settlement battle yet enjoyable ai unit path finding settlement battle horrible unit constantly moving entity running getting stuck wall etc
unit constantly changing path barricade built somewhere even path
furthermore unit tend take corner sharp possible resulting blobbing corner beeing super slow
therefore take lot micro management move troop around town still take age arrive anywhere
made even worse messy camera constantly obstructed building bridge tower ever handle height difference well
oh avoiding dockable area defender also sometimes tricky zone large new game less feature content favorite war
originally fairly negative review due rendering issue made game unplayablethose fixed genuinely love generally balanced pve fun hellpraise emperor pas bolt rifle
veri good game shoot head love gamegameplay ruskies around knife case fun like long time

pretty nuff said monkey action rpg gameeasier soul game thx would rage quit awesome game
highly recommended
great shooting game buuuut personally meet lot hacker ofc toxic people
know lot gamer girl even boy meet
make little less play game cheat toxic people really good game
work perfectly fine
fun friend
lot gamemodes explore great map recommend game must play think exaggerating say game become cult classic game like elder scroll morrowind masquerade bloodline yes game became one favorite game time
hey alien alien suck anti alien alarm alien get leave leave alone uaaaaghhhh get get protective shield protective shield protective shield dracula mummy alien activate alarm kill approach die ahhhhhhhhhh big sword go swoosh diversity great minute hour
glad picked one
played campaign including greasus ogre kingdom dlc
refused try skarbrand since blood gore game faction dedicated chaos god blood skull
game closer mod overhaul sequel anyone claiming unfair compare got dow debacle
far technical issue ran fine
machine issue
really mess every level though
talent nurgle example literally copy pasted others work even worse slaanesh one disables bonus source diplomacy effectively killing half mechanic faction
kislev major disappointment readily apparent work effort went katarin kostaltyn afterthought barebones empire general
ignoring flanderisation ice bear literally everywhere mod fix return bardiche axed streltsi etc
ironically ice school magic
tempest one standouts better overall still weaker
bear probably strongest cav game right maybe even warhammer faction certainty boris buffing
cav unit kislev pointless
elemental bear single target huge missile sponge monster suck
fun unlocking boris swapping campaign could ignore reputation race
also prime target side literally everyone human better hand far fleshed overall mostly useful unit tier
terracotta warrior would good size flashy animation mean usually miss whatever trying hit anyway
miao buffed cathay artillery best warhammer faction including dwarf
added bonus hot air balloon fire rocket battery ammo imperial rocket empire damage better position situation fire obvious power creep
cathay still need work
dlc might flesh game life long enough get super strong fun nerfed barrier due mp complaint army super squishy skirmisher without speed accomplish
tzeentch magic super powerful though
anyone even experience since major faction battle mechanic involving generating wind magic literally work
press button visual effect go nothing actually happens
sp mp custom battle
stop ca nerfing need work
cauldron less half interaction effect groms randomness application unloreful closer tzeentch functionally worthless
viable way play group everything slowly roll murderball towards enemy moshpit fight spamming heals needed
boring exceptionally weak strategically
look cool lord bit boring
tried massively buffed everything since worst role ever released
remember lord rome better campaign battle like numidia
ended going undivided last campaign played thoroughly sick game
blood khornecannot stand slaanesh
ironically faction mostly broken technically design like use uber seduction mechanic seduce order faction vassal seen victory chaos daemon faction instantly declare war
making entire point faction strength ogre unfinished faction suffer pre order faction like chaos
primary mechanic contract safely ignored since end going war everyone around practically non existent gold reputation reward
closer cathay caravan mechanic allow siege kill certain character settlement achieve something without ruining diplomacy
offer kind redemption contract fact get back good grace whoever paid pittance mess
currently really war random visible faction every turn mechanic reward making best choice every time simply ignore
ogre good unit fun interesting
extremely strong
gorger anything go mp rest gutted uselessness stupidly expensive like worth campaign map might bigger ever feel tiny since half barren chaos territory reasonably conquer daemonic faction
daemonic faction critical issue round thought heard skarbrand fine except see lack blood gore serious critical issue playing khornate faction
chaos realm
idea
tzeentch realm literally cheat counter play beyond hoping ai go spawn near quickly take auto complete
forced interact timed mechanic auto lose campaign work total war
vortex campaign great least art mechanic script complete
end cut scene even depiction interacting ursun
scene voice
compared custom scene per race altered per sec long time
overall vortex campaign spawned army like realm race issue like around someone elses territory raiding unable fought whoever spawned
however option gang vortex race fight permanently ending whole thing allowing battle last one belakor interesting maybe per faction
become bore
auto resolve final fight
mention reward getting belakor terrible unlocked current playthrough bonus faction unlock atrocious
already everything need game faction literally available option instead custom daemon lord
maybe immortal empire fix coming till sept earliest already declared beta
ca largest developer uk yet proving beyond doubt clearly bled competency talent main dev team
numerous incredibly simple error modders literally fixed week took ca week address
even easiest fix clearly play game
internally must chaos pun intended
dlc team release formal announcement taking future development game maybe year
game still supported end year maybe
right waste time money
game forking fun much constant crashing
played hour every game end least twice crashing per game
u release game still fill bug
sheer amount linear algebra packed game insane even include fully quantized neural network run minimal ram end end latency
number triangle boss insane
absolutely love part get break triangle stick
masterpiece
still plenty issue warhammer iii developer finally seem gotten message
race unit diversity warhammer series really amazing hour combined warhammer still many race yet play
hopefully ca stick word continues improve whiii
new stutter mechanic quite transformative
bad game worst game ever counter strike game
dont play trash
definitely goty amazing
recommended
take game game average
bad perfect either
game best warhammer game
know warhammer probably get lot positive emotion
everything brutal bloody fun
played lot game lately liked lot much fun long time
game like good anime without schoolgirl kitten immortal empire make worth trust dude
got destroyed flower
strongest monkey
monkey strongest
good videogame ton doubt playing game first couple day
decided enjoy got mind reset going go ham
really fun cool game doubt playing say go
super fun sure issue really see bad anymore
problem game likely mod fix good experience
mean cocktail best soft game offer demon soul sekiro addition massive breathtaking open world
alone isnt enough warrant purchase move along
isnt game looking
made break head headsetalso check game called art war red tide ca probably one biggest example gaming today company dev team think able whatever want expect consumer pay whatever want charge consumer go hey wait minute producing thing want price ridiculous sort mean horrible troll understand hard ca
frankly alarming feel able fairly openly say pay lot money fund game pet project pay extra cash dlc get nothing else game actually like occur consumer obviously going board already playing game total war warhammer series enjoying probably already bought total war warhammer feel however
new player really something suggest getting involved
wonder wether get game tabletop version get model cheaper game fun though happen rich feel inclined overspend stuffbut real tired defending ca stab back
released said let wait immortal empire complain
chaos warrior said lord inflation reasonably priced
chaos dwarf said race pack inflation little discount preordering bad
soc know say keep damn patch need ruin cathay modder fix bug faster still stand point mentioned ca trying fix thing
see go
literally end result valorant csgo baby look like difference baby super power ability
able access astro world teleportation jelly creature plant obliterate enemy far best major upgrade game ever seen valve
game truly wonderful heavy focus providing good improved user experience player sound design graphical user interface change change across map even inventory system
department game designer developer good job sure said far perfect
game bit bright default map hard adjust used great might adjust game brightness setting first area need improvement pertain action strafing sideways moving action feel bit inaccurate sometimes strafe hit right almost like angled strafe movement compared legacy version csgo straight forward left right
however minor observation take away overall beauty upgraded better csgo overall
well depends player prioritizes visuals like valorant impress love
come csgo love static style might need game adapt little indeed fun despite nb remember mute everyone premade lobby
dark soul best thing come brilliant mind
prepare visit different swamp different insant kill enemy permanent hp drain zone dog immaculate always assist getting love game love shafted enemy time looking godskin duo would love hear malenia
blade miquella
every second ryan gosling endorse game
mid survival game base crafting character creator
monke big stick really like peak worth year waiting
good ketchup buy game life
dead serious
product received free got game amd gpu quite excited keep crashing story mission matter setting ultra low vsync single part game always crash time beat black myth coming back game
absolutely awful graphic compared second game almost look like mobile game recommend game current state
unit detail especially disappointing
pretty decent total war fan game playing since empire total war unfortunately experienced terrible release hopefully fix cant recomend anyone unless u huge warhammer total war fan case ur buying anyway
hopefully soon delete review fix
average elden game trap gem world trash game like good thing say bad
still good thing still bad
environment cinematics overall presentation game outstanding almost make shallow combat bos mechanic dreadful exploration
said combat still fun bos fight still epic level still beautiful lot bad thing
voice acting story overall message great super difficult follow read cartoon kid
cool seldom useful
upgrade system exists
graphic beautiful need configured properly optimization said game filled content including optional secret content get cut made dlc like many game would
major prop
feel like finished game except technical issue complaint still played game almost finished time review
take
unplayable ever since update
think cheating issue problem got worse
impossible single match without atleast cheater
unless valve take action expect lot actual player permanently signing
favour start new year playing c go
fun game
run well system hear need optimization steam deck tried yet
recommended want epic spyware forced even online portion
neither need want cross play
great game
get better pc kid
almost hour completed campaign poked around handful others
game shining spot also lot major issue gameplay performance absolutely beautiful graphic turned high
detail map battle map unit faction fun play depending like play campaign
find unit balanced well throughout faction narrative absolutely amazing overall
first playthrough captivated prologue story told soundtrack amazing listen playing certain faction
con game perform well even strong computer
impossible frame running program background
could achieve fps turning graphic setting mechanic base campaign atrocious
without going much detail main campaign requires complete different chaos area significantly punish completing
unlike previous campaign ion forced play narrative even want
would like read chaos mechanic atrocious go read legendoftotalwar post previously stated problem incentive continue play game forced narrative already seen
first campaign becomes somewhat repetitive deal making game would recommend game yes fixed mechanic campaign release mortal empire version
protest
longer shamfurl dispray
best total war far extremely fun mechanic lot quality life improvement last game complaint anti piracy thing reduced performance otherwise masterpiece game amazing fun
problem copious amount testosterone violence xenophobia
think enough
great game nonetheless
never seen game beautiful graphic
top animation end chapter exquisite music rich combat system intriguing plot highlight exquisiteness game
based fact still added officer unit regiment real shame
gave ca benefit doubt fun previous iteration series tolerate state game point
numerous bug issue plagued game since launch addressed despite fact nearly year half since release
even know say goty excellent warhammer game effort put game apparent opening cinematic
slight server issue im hoping fixed upon full release overall
fact wanted play friend unable started later wasnt able join server due player cap almost unforgivable thing day
player able join low active population server worry someone made character launch dipped level
every newbie gamer scared playing soul game first soul like use controller usually play game super easy mode still blast
like fence git gut also playing keyboard totally doable
moving damaging learning rope little confusing beginning
time tell play really super fun
even wan na relax bit ride donkey pick flower outrun enemy really tell super noob play game enjoy
chinese playing black myth wukong suggestion interested story line cultural element first try understand element game impossible
monster yaoguai could quote confucius decayed wood carved
start reading novel journey west long challenging understand
incorporates lot chinese philosophical thought buddhist taoist idea interpreted many angle including political cultural perspective offering completely different yet plausible explanation
want quickly understand journey west watch tv series name
watching playing game give completely different experience
""
chinese language tends implicit
simply put often indirect tend happens collectivist society especially china
example chinese drama often involve lot implicit expression meaning directly state viewpoint phenomenon analyze hided meaning behind script
house card u drama fit well consider typical preference among chinese people
playing game watching show might try analyze logic motif behind give hint may find monster know wukong position type monster usually call wukong horse wukong assigned job alike cowboy call wukong horseboy wukong usually wont fight em directly
instead wukong try find help see owner master monster eventually monster back
however ending monster without background death
masterwork ahead offer rump
far amazing journey spectacular intro hairy wolf shown game fun challenging
died couple time beating boss
environment compare soul like becoz old gtx
still holding
getting fps average medium setting fsr frame gen except intro scene bit demanding look awesome crash far good game hampered bunch bug mismanagement clearly interested fixing many bug plagued game update feature arrive broken work new dlc shadow change come less content previous dlcs especially considering new tzangor unit barely reworked beastman unit new model improving quality game obviously decided raise price dlcs hoped nobody would burning lot goodwill ca imagine turning well game fun update get harder harder get entertaining part series

since game sucked like
oohhh elden brother
month early access warhammer iii finally released fun play
immortal empire super fun play finally game great
unfortunately due nature time gating rapid wipe cycle week per server recommend game

like god war elden ring dark soul
ca aim thumb good
game issue free great building exploring fun combat great especially random scary boss freak free kept entertained
nothing amazing fun enough play around bit
elden ring one thrilling satisfying game ever played
atmosphere completely drew immense pleasure exploring world hour
game difficulty might seem intimidating first played learned enemy attack pattern challenge motivated
victory gave tremendous sense gameplay fluid finely crafted
control responsive movement directly translated character
required time practice master combat system process incredibly satisfying
inclusion different weapon magic option allowed diversify playstyle provided opportunity employ different strategy term richness elden ring disappoint

additionally time loop system allowed experience different encounter event making playthrough ring story completely immersed
lore world design profound captivating

loathsome dugeater addictive
many thing
good game
actual campaign amazing
problem multiplayer currently unreliable
even work need disable steam overlay otherwise trapped infinite loading screen even frequent server disconnect lag ever present issue
however since core game play great post release patch address issue dought great game
p
found campaign difficulty tuned
playing veteran originally hard mode found game incredibly frustrating imagine game balanced around coop play since ai squad mate virtually useless
order enjoy experience would recommend playing normal otherwise trying job three player
thing elden
hug
die
get wrong human total
world look amazing
man gameplay snoozefest
could easily cheese way stuff exploring felt like chore
even get started player house blocking everything cool
like everyone decided build little fort right middle action
malenia blade miquella amazing game ruined people top completing two playthroughs game review elden ring best game ever made
culmination everything software learned last decade
every ounce challenge compared previous title even super fun play
art design breathtaking level design stunning soundtrack slam bos design gotten even better since previous game world huge beautiful ton list thing liked
""
give unique moveset using two weapon
spirit summons
allows get extra help without buffing bos
also super useful caster exploring area lot tough war
finally make weapon unique useful manually assigning weapon art depending
removal vitality stat allows using heavy armour without spend level seperate stat really good
level vitality wear use heavy gear tied stamen list thing disliked
exploration
early game exploration elden ring slightly boring
nothing limgrave except weapon
benefit exploration come game good weapon spell talisman
heavy weapon greatswords colossal sword colossal weapon nerfed since previous title
much slower swing speed recovery
hope release patch buff recovery time
current state almost useless fast hard hitting enemy moderate amount poise
top buffed katanas small sword making meta time due speed ability damage
""
weapon split damage arcane scaling river blood elenora poleblade mohgywn sacred spear broken
flat damage value scale attribute despite scaling value
hope patch future fix
lot boss repeat duo
repeat boss kinda boring fight
duo irritating
dont unique dynamic like ornstein smough one fast slow arena split aggro duo boss game two bos shoved small room barely cover
speed gank
performance issue
frame drop freezing using steam overlay
game crash
issue fixed seems
one best game ever played
solid epic game fire great game people ask elden ring worth playing
worthy enough play elden ring
nice game love color hope developer delete account active since release
mean account play hour play play anymore day least space friend want join u mind wipe coz keep blueprint
hve grind bit back
mind server holding useless inactive acc
wipe earlier active player play friend
great game great combat great far many many many enemy type jttw duh yay bos rush con effect heavy give massive drop change graphic setting lowest hard battle stutter looking yin tiger either pay triple price half content kill game
want telling customer kept patiently waiting functioning game since release
hate rift campaign worth wait mortal empire
buy wait worth
hear n word pure enjoymentgame look play like trailer seriously tuffu must buy right else game alright
thing wish controller option fun every time hop game either great time contemplating suicide
best game ive ever played
feel like going another bought release stopped playing week later game hoping wrong
look fantastic weapon got punch swarm look pretty decent kinda wish helldivers like sound voice line everything seems bug voice tend cut seems common issue
character bit squishy least veteran difficulty
like super squishy vermintide either thankfully bad close though matchmaking campaign bizarre
think destiny devs clueless enough never add simple matchmaking tool make everyone least happier finding people easier
campaign rather bland number get warhammer game universe
lot wiggle room creativity violence
tried multiplayer mode yet update review change opinion doubt recommend people like universe want continue space marine story everyone else wait update dlc finishing trying pve recommend game campaign extremely short
even veteran difficulty probably take less hour decent player using lower difficulty probably much operation pve mode
either nobody join need quit main menu start put people side planet ping host disconnect host migration seems broken
way many loading screen despite playing samsung nvme beast machine game take long time load getting stuck various server connection required even single player campaign operation might get stuck forever fail game also questionable
game centered around horde enemy fast paced combat unacceptable hiccup delay broken animation game deciding take break middle weapon swing shield shielding jetpacks kicking character simply getting frozen unable move
tell effort multiplayer went armor customization various cosmetic rather optimization polishing
finally serious issue balancing assault class extremely weak people outright laughing refusing play bulwark vanguard preferred much easier play
warhammer launched expected
need optimization bug crash major slow down far
doubt fix stuff eventually
unit pretty awesome graphic nice looking forward immortal empire
rat ca believe game top steam stats played game
even surpassed
black myth wukong made history spehss mureens crash disappointing
terrible anti cheat people getting false ban high command real cheater getting new content new operation year ton map missing deleted achievement csgo pointless one make new danger team sub tick garbage wanted spaghetti net short flying replay performance peekers bad ranking economy change despite movement shooting worse compared csgoall make hundred million dollar yet unable make fun new content unbelievable yet waste time boring hero shooter deadlock abandon within first month release like dota underlords valve need wake start caring game shot guy died pretty fun thing need malenia bloodborne pc pc spec running game setting
thing wan na talk intro video awesome however spec enough provide good quality video dot pixel around shape character
actually issue running benchmark tool something like spider web float river
basically graphic good imo unless higher gpu
exchange game run super smooth difficulty bos fight harder expectation still need manage character stamen either attack doge way easier darksoul series
stop bos transform monster high attack power deal damage
also go check skill tree build good set reduce difficulty map exploration bad medium said
game easy find way back reach edge map
many forked road patient exploring may lead different boss say game myth wukong definitely flaw first day release still worth buy play
intense bos fight experience zen atmosphere attract much
strongly recommend play game using chinese voice audio
life honour fate duty fear fear reward salvation craft craft pledge pledge eternal service
pls let play csgoplssssss right say elden ring person played every game multiple time already said
first blind luckily playthrough first character clocked hour time killed every bos every dungeon got achievement
mean elden ring packed hour content average player almost much u fan
hour content perfectly scattered throughout land fluidity pace exploration make elden ring opinion greatest open world game seen
every enemy item dungeon grace location feel intentional creates amazing game world love yharnam lothric drangleic ashina boletaria even ageless kingdom lordran
lore amazing character richer weapon many impactful magic better ever boss grander flow combat nearly perfected world bigger first time many new player delight real choice illusion choice like master key looking dark soul purist
elden ring flaw

warhammer thousand hour believe arguable one best fantasy strategy game
diversity fantasy race large
faction also add enough uniqueness great deal replay value
enjoy strategy game note lot dlc bought sale occur often would highly suggest waiting sale happen almost every month
also base game count expansion warhammer offer access race
also getting recent dlc would grant access content previous dlc race
instance champion chaos provide content older warrior chaos dlc new throne decay grant access content warhammer dwarf empire decay dlc ca shown commitment updating core campaign experience deliver better customer value
finally patch core gameplay issue ai pathing responsiveness made battle much enjoyable
plan move smaller dlc pack going forward
long smaller pack include reworks campaign balancing recommend playing warhammer
ca go back greedy practice decay sure change review

""
reviewed august based pve server experience probably best minimal
game basically survival shooter mmorpg must explore build home find food water kill zombie bizarre creature
variety main quest enemy great although copycat game movie
story well dialogue sound like google translated chinese english sometimes create corny moment skipped cutscenes complete entire main quest solo immersing hour base building exploration combat
however playing group even enjoyable beneficial share resource support one quest take around hour complete excluding side quest
endgame depending specialization farm crafting resource prepare canned food drink stat buff craft tool sell others
alternatively focus become dungeon warlord taking hard boss participating prime player pve event advanced game progress reset every week item preserved server full wo able create character play friend
developer mentioned plan introduce character server transfer option prime war bit laggy new player need worry since optional many bug ca even need optimization performs poorly hdd computer experience constant texture story mediocre many questionable lore care story multiplayer game though xd full bug crash anti fun feature developer support barely taking age bare minimum
bug report list internal jira probably longer recent negative review
wonder handful fix release new dlc nothing guess time scarce leave room bug fix spend available time come much could possibly charge next know new bug introduced new dlc never fixed make game expensive also worse
game vacuum fun creative assembly one blatantly anti consumer company ever seen favor go check recent video youtuber volound get better description could ever hope provide ca care anything money pocket support legitimately almost better throwing money fire giving
right discus privilege paying crappy bare minimum effort garbage call game hope rot fun lack ultra wide monitor support super annoying game look amazing though company currently running franchise ground
allready threatened stopping support heavily increased price
stay away buy game good company like larian studio really fun game bit lore probably confusing know anything think story easy enough understand basic coming though
wait gamepass play game clunkyness really bad hitboxes terrible level design unimaginative combat shallow crafting system lack reward exploration inconsistency skill tracking thing make really hard recommend people spend game hour game think still hour beating
lol good one took hour beat first play kept playing
found two new area beaten final bos done nothing since thursday february wake play game go sleep
concerned liking open world like fromsoft game give elden ring chance swear worth
open world game last decade full nothing
look nice next zero substance
elden ring open world comparable breath wild game since botw release made feel way botw
every way right way
insane new stuff around every corner
think dementia every minute find insane new thing forget actually trying beforehand
graphical marvel fromsoft never chance apply style fully realized world land jaw dropping time always stunning regardless location
core still soulsborne hard compare rest series much difference open world make
elden ring worth wait easily one favorite game time
game worth full price always support fromsoftware buy game afford
hopefully making memorable creative game forseeable worried pc performance issue many people complained input
super ram amd ryzen processor ghz
occasionally every minute maybe stutter large open area lot particle effect screen
unplayable second two reduced framerate
never gotten killed made difference life death hour
locked problem either
like said fromsoft game never graphical innovator
difference frame negligible fromsoft made clear working optimize much possible
noticeable improvement day even
could probably run game fine recommended spec suggest
unplayable unless complete snob case suggest remove graphic card rear end
best way learn russian quick
learn friendly nickname like zalupa kozel useful sentence like past zabej padla jebanaja ti liubeesh papeenu sassat connect eastern european brother way never teamkill speaking way nurture friendly feeling russian since chernobyl
cheating game full release bug still much prevalent
unit disappear siege battle stand close wall
unit climb ladder get shot siege battle
naval point interest crash game time
bug remember worry creative assembly release overpriced garbage dlc
fix game first recommend
good game dog every company seems pretty violent butt hurt since baldur gate came
aaa company hate ca rip money wallet anymore consumer
plenty mod sure community could make already emulate dlc content release even better ca work
thought game workshop could slaughter old world ip badly see game company take direction maybe stop letting big wig run show money make quality like shogun medieval
never write review see played game tiny bit really love despite flaw
mostly wanted write feel mixed review score really game justice
keep short possible ill say game ton option fun hell
lot crappy thing creative assembly done tanked game score past month well quality dlc update listening community feedback
know stay true end day matter overall stand right game good
yes like genre style game imo one best game buy right issue price entry others said highly recommend buying thing sale easy find online
great gameplay microtranscation b pay campaign based experience thats exactly get hope receive content going forward great starting game play soul like game
game year worthy arm demolition bot ton missing frequent audio fps main menu csgoall new feature making hole smoke get prettier skin map moving character csgo backat least keep csgo name actually sound good
bad game
graphic amazing sound design fantastic smooth combat punishing time also reward skill develop
skill tree ton variety mix match since resetting skill free
lose nothing upon dying exploration encouraged rewarding
story good boss unique intriguing
gameplay fluid allows clean combat experience
overall game combine element need amazing single player experience although flaw recommend game enough
first big release impressive able could without doubt see game year
embrace monke game like dark soul pretty much killed warhammer update game breaking bugfixes like drycha repanse quest battle fix

wall implementationso one bit divisive issue
open world game implement invisible wall feature block player area world inaccessible primarily help immersion
black myth wukong flawlessly make world entirety questionable area whatsoever enough impossible tell part world accessible
one rare situation wherein player would really benefit map least display general area
add fact map refer get annoying exploring chest reason might arguable game company getting flack past year spoonfeeding player go overly complicated detailed looking ubisoft
game like elden ring natural flow exploration use map player general idea
black myth wukong took exploration even higher level letting player freedom want yet may argue case use clear invisible wall might helped ironically verdict game perfect even called superb worthy praise
many game drop ball fast hard trying stick political agenda video game going greedy route last month
gamers may need touch grass sometimes always stupid braindead either
customer base looking buy product provides return singleplayer game strong foundation lore gameplay believe put gaming industry map first place
industry tried hand many possible path try find perfect route stable era gaming title like elden ring nioh ghost tsushima black myth wukong proven time time single player laid solid foundation path truly satisfies core audience
game give hatred human new less brain n social would recommend everyone paska peli ei toimi enää lolololol praise monke game fun get monke elden ring action role playing rpg crusher simulator created fromsoftware explore open world land fight hard boss completing quest trying die
fell love soulsborne series first started playing bloodborne went whim bought demon soul well dark soul
heard game ago got hyped soon could waiting year start game
platinumed game hoping start steam someday future thought story one thing kind explore figure piecing together piece dialogue item description well environmental cue
ca even tell much anything say like fromsoft soul title love
keep goal simple tarnished individual banned former queen land going spot elden lord fight several different demigod order
run several character via world hubworld roundtable hold could anything basically nothing giving entire new ending
say plot gameplay basically almost game soul series
go area area loot object fight boss complete particular quest line certain reward enemy invader except one caveat open world
mean open world
game lot simplified well complex bit open term pathway shortcut etc also straight way point point b well
game everything basically tenfold term game play design get certain area fight certain boss
one example order get leyendell couple different way get region
one could ride grand lift dectus need two half medallion get forth haight fort faroth
another way could going underneath church near lift going village climbing mountain killing magma wyrm getting way
another way get bottom waterwheel raya lucaria wake area volcano manor fight way cave
stuff like mindblowing amazing much attention detail scope took truly create thing
keep mind one example list everything truthfully like game much stuff list making f u c king video essay
also essence think game detriment well huge kind overwhelming scale lose uniqueness see multiple boss repeated different skin
also found combat hard definitely challenging yes sure suck felt game definitely geared towards summon spirit bos combat
always someone liked coop anyways cool kind frustrating time certain boss
guess finish aware game difficult yes community great
sure sholes tell get gud make believe bunch basement dwelling pee larpers
yes
amount people go way help reason amazing
know order summon people get furlcalling finger remedy
found loot crafted via erdleaf flower bought certain merchant etc
also certain place able summon player activate summoning pool keep lookout small great even sure could expand upon feel soundtrack memorable soul game
either way matter fit background made everything memorable played even though got remember much
still look great art design amazing graphic good justice game single steam review new series wan na try know play fresh wing bit fun try get overwhelmed experience everything impossible though possible get trophy one playthrough thing
research game bit see build want go though starting class kind gear certain way say research start game unless kinda want wing farm bit upgrade stats
please god take break take pace die die die die frustrating strange loop click click
""
ok shame
elden ring culmination thing fromsoft done soul game expanded upon great effect sometimes mixed result certain thing certainly deserves game year title
ca become type video game company gamer hate
way treat fan base disgusting emperor protects product received free really good overall graphic obviously amazing game actually excels transition really polished animation stunt lot tricky gimmick second half campaigncombat also great imo work better boss mob since ultimately build focus point spend heavy attack thats fun dodging constantlylikewise story nice cause said cutscenes really polished character interaction interesting zhu bajie funny quirk also need background order understand boss struggle guess youre familiar journey west might catch extra insighti also think game fantastic job portraying chinese mythos daoist iconography latter area really evocative really make see many face buddha
personally excellent portraying cultural background massive leap forward wuxia genrei think ever make sequel would benefit platforming element maybe little puzzle solving zone connect bos get bit shallow sometimes chapter decent managed run somewhat stable fps rtx clocking default speed frame generation option even graphic card best competitive multiplayer game ever
huge variaty strategy mostly great teamplay
monke go bonk tldr pure action packed fun
like hitting thing seeing defeated
went expectation
honest idea game till heard record say least extremely impressed
glued game instantly

second stage fight play stone monkey amazing cinematography fighting special move etc
ended getting trophy
fun time part
farm item felt like added add moderate amount extra playtime reason

lit bad new content old content removed performance issue bad ranking system toxic community lazy devs
sound like game want play
creative assembly fully expects game playerbase buy rushed expansion funnel money hyena game barely anyone aware nobody asked highly recommend people give game go play something else
worth keep supporting company get slap face veiled threat cancel future twwh development altogether
amazing game
amazing monke ca really turning game better
pfew say already said well whats sure game big
bigger thought bigger
thing intrigued content
many thing see hidden dungeon unique item
lot work put vista
game look gorgeous angle matter
like walking various painting
wonderful first take nosedive start paying complain playing game reviewing someone comment pointed fine soul game online feature enjoy coop multiplayer
game gotten worse play finally uninstalled
piece crap first hour game gorgeous
loved riding around open world horse faffing seeing sight small dungeon every throwing first main story boss
time went thing started feel
boss get copy pasted around enemy get reused mini dungeon boss mini dungeon boss become normal enemy get annoying encounter become
culminates castle sol point honeymoon phase game crashed burned although fair already starting around leyndell started see game really wonderful massive open world filled filler copy pasted enemy type boss populate even half area encounter design remind dark soul killing important creating game whack area rarely fit character level half build simply viable later game area especially disappointing since game like kinda stand whole choose build principle
game seems try fix throwing handful respec item
boss chain attack longer pause attack animation unintuitive delay clear feint already annoying attack wind slowly attack bos multiple time opening tell attack going damage done late game boss enemy stupendous leveling vigor important leveling adp
either get play game
late game encounter also enjoyable
later area usually filled enemy spam summoning enemy enemy infinite stamen aggression high poise ridiculous damage
enemy hiding around every corner powerful miniboss enemy grouped jobber enemy programmed try push ledge
childish haha killed thing end would prefer running past reused enemy since fighting going benefit thing game annoys subtly lie design
malenia healing strike also heal hit shield entirely counterintuitive mechanic like usually work like lifesteal heals damage
mohg curse negated wondrous physik tear except tear barely work still get heal health damage ca roll curse animation
hero dungeon dark phantom version enemy need lure onto seal holy light undo invulnerability except using holy attack work especially annoying expected pay attention detail reward observant player phantom chariot version hero dungeon awful btw godskin duo fight pretend throne watcher defender kill one summons back except kill quick succession get summoned back anyways without either needing execute summon animation
feel like mentally engaging game waste effort since fromsoft game incredibly game could wonderful collapsed scope
map big wanted fill many small dungeon gaol encounter ended copy even main story boss mohg astel godrick loretta get used twice margit morgott margit extra move niall fill
embarrassing game nowhere near good hear general discourse bit qualifier add beaten main boss including malenia collected great rune put god know many hour game think pretty okay grasp bos pattern timing
beaten final bos e bos used online coop beat actual mohg fight one curse blood since simply going deal
enjoy thing game
boss find magnificent
radahn one coolest thigns ever encountered except nerfed reason maliketh incredibly well designed bos lot fun fight godfrey radagon also really good fight still enjoy going back help others fight coop safely say find open world gorgeous look still enjoy riding around horse

mostly rust someone stand outside base hurling slur insult shoot
even pvp player seemingly flag cant even level toxic already big group forming
dont know raiding look like however im interested dumping hundred hour find zerg raided base
rust better rebuild much easier non rpg game like seem running fine think ive seen people running around pvp possible troll people game well
standing want build mic repercussion game im softie cod lobby always funny cant shoot wheres fun
male power fantasy yeah
dollar time someone screamed another language still money spent skin
wow

future dlc race one piece freaking legendary hero
""
something cheater product received free alright still video game ever
wowwwwwwwww berserk game see dude goku profile pic f cked
stellar soul game black myth monke dy goty played game hour
found seasonal wipe
lost motivation play
every week lose almost everything
material farmed ax drill crafted spend much time collecting material start every gameplay good lot fun game actually everything
think one best survival game ever played
seasonal wipe stopped playing game
come back dev remove seasonal wipe interested treating main game mindlessly grinding every week
wanted casual survival themed mmo play side
miyazaki game award nice elden ring till im far fromsoft know keep trying every server full player quit game like especially one new player could play pve cause degree cutscene
swear start crypto farm would reach temperature
even cyberpunk elden ring max spec gpu
f uck
emperor approves matter
right discus entitlement earn playing game improves previous game get better time
product refunded monke flip nom fg csgo free rip recommend game sadly
yes really beautiful much content game
took hour third hardest difficulty complete
also solo experience really difficult two ai companion get anything seem get aggro enemy
difficulty drop hard act new enemy fight also bad ai main guy often stand still hit breaking main story kind devolves grind fest cosmetic add purity seal different color armor
change look term form
chaos marine pvp also different armor option knowledge
although eternal war mode pvp fun find hard say worth side note overheat cpu
running noticed getting hot
user online experiencing recommend look setting guide fixed dr enough little good enough customization
wait sale content far game decade space marine around corner tho combat incredible soundtrack incredible graphic run super smoothly hella game made appeal western audience specifically loooot stuff flying head familiar journey west novel find silly reviewer complain
egotistical assume every game specifically made plenty minute video youtube giving quick recap original novel essential info fully enjoy game highly recommend watching playing game novel really cool anyway like slog sit current state recommend game
well year since release game absolutely plagued bug
patch infrequent lackluster creative assembly seems happy churn overpriced dlc rather fixing content already paid total war fan since hour previous title
bought every major title almost dlc
ca burned goodwill carefully amassed last year month
trust left abandoned three kingdom botched release money go buy good game developer actually care delivering maintaining good product like baldurs gate
done total war
replayability game astounding really fun play friend
buying requisite costly skaven related dlc unless getting steam sale nothing year ca released dlc called forge chaos dwarf new race neat new mechanic unit consisting legendary lord
well received basically launched minimal next issue far one fav faction play personally
cost
ca executive board releasing lord pack shadow change simply stack based value proposition established chaos dwarf dlc
shadow price includes new race revolution mechanic new unit
apparently kislev lord also bugged point unplayability
getting shadow change live value proposition ca established earlier year total war ca biggest property instead training strength giving tw warhammer time attention game need executive board clearly plowing total war profit derivative clone inevitable failure game called hyena
executive board member clearly bunch hack know nothing business
know chasing audience detriment core product worked entertainment company modern cinema writ large netflix disney
paying attention
think better positioned dollar entertainment company failed gamble
game workshop need revisit partnership read ca board riot act else risk poisoning massive gw ip
come back said first line review
replayability game amazing
therefore need new crap dlc make keep game fun friend
wo buying anything ca least garbage secondary product hyena launch subsequently fails
love letter gamers fan alike saber disappoint
congrats devs first try achievement
always problem even higher hardware xtx see soul lite compare skill tree humongous rpg fan concurrent player first hour win diversity needed
game year simplefast pace run fine cheap as gtx
got ta ding individual unit response though sure bad game everything worked fine last game
post actually thought nerfs rift overkill
guess appeal lowest common denominator though
average elden ring enjoyer awesome graphic awesome awesome story
love tldr fun time
recommending wipe mechanic
yes read keep
still wipe still lose stuff
nerfs pve pvp lootboxes done till add private server single player option
wipe
move everything pick choose thing bring next scenario reset back level one move next scenario
keep blueprint mod weapon accessory cosmetic special currency
lot people still want keep stuff jump scenario far seems devs keep pushing stuff
pvp wipe make sense pve wipe waste time
still continued play hoping change
ranching game lose animal done combat since new august patch reading patch note nerfed thing seems mainly balance pvp affect pve majority playerbase
imagine spending week earned starchrom currency build nerfed last bit scenario part game even participate
lootboxes
cosmetic
however find lootboxes game predatory
gambling
rng
people getting duplicate time open box
people spend money box premium currency still get fancy skin bike
put item directly shop
sega become far greedy last year
pricing strategy total war football manager franchise insane
buy sale heavily discounted
support release base game dlc release
another game ca
game community holy w game absolutely unplayable cheater everywhere nothing done try resolve problem play fixed alright game still pretty good even game breaking invisible enemy bug
well like reset every season basically still uncooked lot graphical bug cool prefer undawn atmosphere cool base building awesome
since go work dont time world spend
make game make optimal play completely circumvent
spent time workshop gameawesome game tho huge total war fan understand complaint campaign
still warhammer love game
kislev fun khorne arguably easiest fun like straight domination
add add rest faction campaign warhammer game going perfection
chef kiss awesome game ca wait see sun entire weekend time
hour lol noice
heavy exploration first area map secret seem end
always new area go
always npc putting obscure caught glimpse actual map wiki around map yet uncover
best area boss game entirely optional even hidden behind highly obscure questlines simply lost word trying explain magnificent map design
like took map design dark soul cranked game sheer insanity term beautiful fun like soul game atleast truly generational title everybody emperor
man game greatest fps around nobody better
creator around leader multiplayer team tactic shooter period
edit change negative review unfortunately
devs said stream yesterday enough oce player playing justify making new server
sure server thought oce player would playing
disappointing gameplay fun game content impossible ping
revisit review ever support aussie playing game
original positive review awesome game
feel like love child division monster hunter rust new world
unfortunately oce server getting ping australia
hoping get u pvp pve server quickly aussie player move another seen negative review issue fixed addressed
jump check
free
whats brief summary warhammer space marine uh well space marinesloading screen buggy cutscenes oh chainswords
mother f cking c h n w r
seriousness yeah alright enough game short decent campaign albeit aforementioned cutscene error bug either freeze audio continues opposite audio lagging behind visuals cutscene
combat fun allowing pull cool finisher enemy regain health shield finishing move action game always win control feel quite janky awkward keybinds set game pc
operation mode currently error get stuck hub readying level would certainly benefit variety otherwise level could get repetitive people like think like left dead play level countless time game play keep fun linear objective possible could probably help make level feel less repetitive
hopefully content addition operation mode hopefully reach bit potential offer still simply romping friend random ally curb stomping alien together fun solid foundation hopefully improved pvp multiplayer mode play space marine faction chaos marine evil hellish marine faction fight
played much yeah alright want
ca unfortunately customise chaos faction character get premade model class side look cool seam like people still let ca customise well like space marine
far seen there many like cool takedown anything enemy player clunky space marine side blasting thwacking clumsily like call duty game using ultimate ability cohesion see dy first respawning ability charged rush back fight repeat process
yeah alright may like pvp stuff personally think pve stuff game strong point
mode pvp mode separate level progression though think level class mode pop pvp skilled pve dude stomp fool fair however class level progression separate mode
still unlock cosmetic currency armour piece character completing match mode character
still play mode still count cosmetic progress least class beat match thats look tldr decent game able run around stomp enemy ally playing giant f ck power armoured boy still awesome
heck big warhammer series fan meaning knew bugger lore starting learn thing universe playing game encouraged look bit
need fan franchise know everything enjoy game simple fella saw big mech suit chainsaw brutally ripping alien scum shreads thats wanted
still solid cool game play fun wreaking havoc enemy big space marine ruthlessness brutality
think would benefit addition content foundation build add level maybe variety objective keep mode becoming stale
season pas content cosmetic bit disappointing far colour decal really hoping actual standout armour piece justify content far leaf alot desired imo
democracy
uh
mean emperor
right fellow helldivers
""
mean uh battle brother
please shoot promise traitor
load boltgun malicious intent worth hype
oh
really made open world

would reccommend single player multiplayer
oh elden ring ohhh elden ring love game want support dlc priceedit continue right thing moving forward
hope product received free someone playing since say worst version yet
massive registration error terrible graphic make feel kid awful lighting affect amount broken spray pray laser beam even people running taking away ability see damage console extremely helpful c go
well taking away game mode ie gun game
trying force like version simply ca
neat feature added dynamic smoke
joke game
also would really like thank valve taking away c go everyone library especially payed game longer access
great
mortal empire map come bug fix tldr buy
lot bug ca seem reluctant fix
plus pricing problem
original review posted july see bottom review almost year since wrote short review
answer question performance improved greatly still best mile better pricing stand larger community
ca tried push price hike make predicted loss whilst project work
community issue expected cover predicted game worth buying
short feel
better game far polish time
buy dlc key sale little term bug fixing including long list issue really break positive could raise review
following comment tw subreddit listing major issue dev lead seem willing fix year reported feel pointless even consider purchasing dlc base game state like reported countless time often marked known issue many spread awareness bug issue one know map ai utterly suck unable put proper fight army effectively develop mechanic diplomacy ai way form beyond awful especially around vassal perception nearby faction ai literally aware faction nearby diplomatic contact pathing manual battle especially city barricade refusing path broken city gate destroyed city wall instead insisting using ladder slowly climb exhaust getting model stuck pull back whole unit order even middle pitched melee shooting moving fast unable shoot despite clear line map broken pathing losight especially top wall insists damaging killing especially artillery piece even player army outnumbers enemy still give city ridiculous advantage even player army outnumbers enemy minor settlement garrison unit fail properly charging especially large one randomly die attacking certain remotely proximity collapsing wall nowhere near close enough valid danger even lord foot randomly die climbing lord cathay dragon especially flat fail perform melee attack well second understand properly react defence siege battle spread army across map unable fight concentrated charging fastest unit start battle certain death especially like clueless properly using aoe magic magic general also make anything anti magic rather bug related skill tech item unit building mechanic etc two character placed exact coordinate campaign map permanently preventing movement quality nonsense common one often better trait either working straight inferior compared available revive norsca faction mechanic intentionally broken ca could bothered properly fix battle ai sometimes simply activate instead unit refuse

right discus entitlement earn playing game ca money time privilege entitlet dca youtuber speaking truth lowest low
best chicken chasing simulator played game globaly would get offended
dlc price got way way way highmany people seem suffer stockholm syndrom euro dlc pack like way muchespacially low frequence bug fix free improvement inflation world justify price hike like full russian toxic people still great game solid side issuesi played campaign hard bit multiplayer long story short campaign great multi could better
gon na go problem noticed may sound bit negative overall blast game want warhammer power fantasy gamecampaigni try make technical possible redact spoilersi liked story loved visuals cherished weapon
gon na talk much story overall character servicable astarte expect highly emotional expressive performance good job conveying arc plot kept amazing
arena setpieces well cutscenes absoultely gorgeous however huge whiplash cutscene cut one one bizzare scene squad land planet orbital drop obviously helmet
land small dust cloud set half second lost hekmets regardless setting wan na get much individual example cause story say peak act iii may love thousand music honest hear time mixing bit weird much say term gun distinct sound feedback great tho minor issue like altfire underbarrel grenade launcher clipping sideways hand melee weapon execution let unleash absolute glorious cinematic carnage made better said also issue
campaign melee way go good reason
tanky ranged enemy pain deal
see weapon seem designed combat multiplayer saw tooltip weapon damage decreasing distance know work campaign either get closer aforementioned enemy sometimes inaccessible shoot approach shoot half ammo might problematic time engaged melee
use long range gun good dealing enemy
opinion adding bit stagger shot making able aim running side weapon would solve bit also make small gun serve purpose beside second problem flying f know one
mostly extention previous thing except ca get melee range
powerful range attack buff horde
one hand game tell focus sort sergeant ranged weapon trust guy soak ammo dodging attack managing chaff
tbh manageable even much time shoot dodge cooldown shared would nice look like getting queue attack know
focusing much fighting one moment feel tedious play campaign controller really made mouse bit critical may beginning wanted play assault class think suffers key problem earlier said melee way go campaign
well complete opposite remind constantly use melee
melee almost completely still time swing long enough enemy run away shoot much damage weird imo gameplay perspective powerful melee incentive get close take risk worth assault slamming next enemy better shoot bolt pistol use melee
shoot approach may better bulwark played shield least wo shot approach
ok slamming enemy work try shooting hovering
yeah
remember told tooltip saying damage fall distance
assault sidearm close hit shot deal meaningful damage
wan na close class proper range option outdamage emperor forbid get close heavy
long range rifle suffer damage fall love hovering immobile target open space
bit rant feel like every class way deal disadvantage success assault mostly enemy team either look could ambush solo player correct
love jump pack desperately want place biased care
think melee damage upped movement melee added state think underwhelming dueling world eater pvp would left side cover op crosshair right side model make peaking right side cover good peaking left side bad enemy see see
ea battlefront solved allowing switch side crosshair know possible say something keep let reiteratethe game awesome
multi fun
content review critical due tendency focus bad salty state jump pack avoiding spoiling game
real blast playing playing friend soon looking forward playing future content great job devs
life honour fate duty fear fear reward salvation craft craft pledge pledge eternal service
sorry leaving negative review feel like game going first step long road fromsoft
people playing masterpiece fromsoft issue even glaring people screeching fault
want become gold standard fromsoft pun intended
complaint nothing though wish less boss think fine reuse little every fill sheer size place
constant bos duo miserable though please stop
godskin duo magma wyrm falling star beast particularly awful boss loathe even remember
shockwaves every large enemy constantly spam also really help
long combo punctuated bos delaying college semester allowing write dissertation graduate summa laude doctorate patience decides hit hp time span millisecond fromsoft patented funny tracking tm also leaf bad taste health damage scaling game unlivable
everyone meta build survive game let alone pvp
room build variety game even many weapon armor option
ditch mace partway sword night flame ordinary mundane weapon survive late game except maybe greatswords ever since
even weapon upgrade ordinary fall damage way boss execute combo blinding speed delay making window attack tiny worth instead
sick buried build every top dying one hit one attack bos combo actively dumping third total level ng vigor unacceptable
previous game issue correct never seen bad fromsoft game especially game package boss way fight like boss sekiro giving dark soul iii movement control
recipe disaster
never issue fromsoft game kill bos think thank god instead cool fight neat atmosphere
course black sheep boss every fromsoft game felt consistently every bos godrick personally liked fight
chore fight boss especially health get insurmountably high one single mistake fight mean instant saying upgrade summons kinda prof point game unreasonable term bos health damage unforgiving combo punishing punishing enemy etc
forced play specific way want reasonably win
like game one way played especially one biggest consistent selling point offering wide range customization option
also god sake please add option allowed beat game drive insane game tout customization refuse option people make freaking population
got ta enough warrant option devs caved pressure whole people replacing gender body got lot time fromsoft game d sekiro even cleared king field game except first one buddy
wanted love game looked like great adventure willing overlook design decision inspired george r r martin kind story writes fit fromsoft history design opinion george writes much sex political intrigue lore mohgwyn lover spat radagon feel like belonged opinion game really made sad
repping game way bok seamster one refuge game
truly loved character delightful

game game game game official release date
still game game game game game game game game game game game unplayable
still launch properly freeze launch otherwise gameplay freeze every second
got game cdkeys ca even get refund either
simply also submitted ticket focus website responded ticket saying investigating issue still fix time provide longer wasting time trying find fix
almost game steam one issue

amount troubleshooting seem fix
ca even get main get launch literally click launch steam wait eventually load

like chance crashing whenever freeze otherwise freeze every sometimes mission gameplay get sent loading screen saying disconnected changing host send back beginning mission
absolutely everything lowest setting vsync
even changed display setting main menu mission run celsius almost instantly
conclusion right terrifying run game insanely hard game appears pushing system even setting turned believe game breaking something like
besides also think server built magnitude bogged right something everyone paid buck completely unplayable half community
elden ring masterpiece mastered art showing without telling

really good game plagued absolutely obscene business practice moronic game design decision creative make long story short imagine buying mortal kombat launch game every character except scorpion locked behind dollar paywalls also pay extra dollar use fatality see gore storymode also playable month launch
point stupid claim inflation complete utter exactly level greed disrespect creative assembly like dollar burn literally care money desperate warhammer fan yeah go ahead buy unless get new management ca pretty much doomed recommend stop
masterpiece
human
brain rot set
patch patch claim address performance issue
first rig loading time became noticeably slower
travelling site lost grace almost instant much
checked friend played also noticed see stutter indoor are whereas mostly area
outdoor area working better
basically worse experience reviewok core game brilliant
sadly ca recommend patch
disregarded technical review lot people complained performance
run game highest end hardware thought hey spec better certainly hardware manage
""
definitely subjective specific see internet people series series problem strix rtx oc gig wd black
also latest video card driver one explicitly mention elden ring support latest window update
game manages drop frame low pretty much setting
also vrr monitor help much perceive frame drop without fps counter reflects gameplay
especially noticeable area affect visual fluidity also flow battle
basically drop make harder time dodging roll game suddenly stutter right bos attack also directly translate input lag pressing button immediately result corresponding action
game requires precision stutter cripple
dungeon literal dungeon area behind fog run pretty well
instance problem margit fight enjoyed lot
fighting tree sentinel choppy quit game good
edit playing
godrick grafted optional fight pretty awful
time smooth random time close bos would attack game would stutter
took almost twice long defeat hardware run dying light effect dlss locked fps well drop rarely see counter affect actual gameplay
disable rt game run well pc stress anything enough engage fan make audible enough
""
mean elden ring look great interesting technical effect would call game sense
photorealistic texture horizon forbidden west incredible shadow illumination dying light ca refund anymore hour played
time spent trying different video configuration going different area game
finally went bought game xbox series x
performance mode look good never scale clear display pc version run perceptibly better fps fluctuation effect gameplay much pc
furthermore xsx run game dead silent pc audible area game make gpu card clock speed go maximum frequency higher dying light rt support sort attitude developer money regret
new game run worse pc current generation console
beyond ridiculous
chance go console version wait additional information driver game ready elden ring release note thing tried game changing pretty much every setting lowest resolution pretty much issue
mean rtx bloody hellnow game direct access apis mean little hope suggestion found online would help take long try high performance thing graphic setting unlimited shader cache size nvidia disabling microsoft device association root enumerator none resulted smooth experience
basically whatever causing stutter would cause stutter matter setting
run lowest setting get stutter exactly place maximum setting
game bottlenecked hardware something wrong way developer used curiosity underpowered gpu power target lowered gpu boost clock mhz mhz
listen effect performance whatsoever
mean elden ring actually utilizing gpu max stuttering
work absolutely significantly underpowered comparison xsx version played bit initial loading time continue main menu twice slow xbox series x pc
look like loading time death slightly better initial loading still much slower resolution noticeably lower
furtermore eager drop
current testing early tree sentinel fight
pc jarringly bad
xsx addition resolution go pretty low feel bad vrr
actually almost killed bos character first attempt xsx
pc struggled kill even gaining level downing margit major conclusion please give money kind developer
see already game sold well pc sad
mean forced company release pc version without properly testing
awfully sure aware performance issue released otherwise zero testing even worse
release console version first delay pc version
also scanned steam still plenty people claiming smooth experience
point believe
know people tend pay attention
seen plenty people console claiming totally happy fps game saying improve game
look since xsx started plenty game supporting higher frame rate console crowd loving complainign new game running fps
people saying anything higher unnecessary even perceivable yeah right
couple generation console fps plenty game people enjoy
every cent spent game well worth go toward emperor
emperor
first entry game easily say incredible far game relatively linear yet challenging putting difficult boss sometimes spending hour trying beat offer side quest secret quest none tedious require game visually stunning
chapter offer different play creature fitting tweak graphic setting game run well around mark rtx super paired barely faced bug crash
game work box
pretty good become one worst game
know happened playing cheater
valve clearly care cheating game
idea talking update far csgo game cheater want play competitive
wish could provide screen team wrote chat weapon see hear u
hey cool game
forget install cheat well
well masterpiece complete hopefully
game fine really stupid amount glitch played couple month ago really damn fun played bug glitch there one really piss reason ranged unit swap melee ranged mode piss playing kislev there alot would mention thats one really decent game ive dumped hr couple month ago coming back wished played refund spent peso im filipino regret purchase pvp awful laggy fun moment rest game really nice looking lot fun
put hour ca get
thing great like improvement diplomacy
overall find actually playing game outright unpleasant
far biggest problem personally settlement battle slog endlessly respawning tower narrow street game pathfinding clearly good enough handle ai idea actually fight battle battle seem drag forever without much excitement
turning minor settlement battle siege battle also effect making field battle fairly rare latter far satisfying fight
effect making dread actually fighting battle game given dislike campaign mechanic mean little actually enjoying campaign took everything bad vortex campaign doubled
little freedom approach campaign everything timer
game penalizes expanding beyond small province
chaos realm tedious get gimmick serf slow whole process ai often bypass entirely
survival battle end realm like siege battle somehow even longer less fun though mercifully autoresolve skip
finally army roster disappointing especially demon faction share unit also fewer unit first place faction
compound problem battle making feel samey short right ca really recommend
lucky avoid bug performance issue people experiencing
even working compelling
feel thin repetitive unpolished worst straight boring
wait immortal empire couple dlc pack drop
right worth time money
though even game issue go beyond enough content doubt foundation game longterm quality expecting
harder find girlfriend everything ever wanted game
true lore
testosterone fueled madness
full throttle send
woke heretic detected praise emperor
sweet baby inc sleenishy cult need purged
may empror protect u skittering talon weakness
goty love game
playing trilogy trilogy came
poured hundred hour
ca decided burn goodwill faith
game would consider favorite time
price increase dlc reporting profit exceeding cost latest annual report justify price increase saying thing getting expensive make worse pr manager advertising u addressing concern

holding bugfixing behind dlc launch threatening drop support game buy dlc
normally laugh
canceled total war kingdom dlc sell love game

absolutely breathtaking visuals
love game mechanic fluid game feel
performance better expected

stutter far complaint
amazing game
game phenomenal
ca wait see add future
never impressed game beaten first chapter took around hour minimal sight seeing
production value otherworldly
played entirety soul franchise nioh favorite game time
strong introduction sequence
never seen gameplay ruin
want experience game doesnt focus uphill battle reach boss boss majority effort placed
played soul series might beaten submission forced think going back bos miserable experience shouldnt game reflects boss incredibly dynamic cinematic attack pattern additionally game perfect dodge reward
resource generation also make combat much cooler visual effect
well played bos fight make feel like attack gameplay loop feel clunky first within first youll realize gain ability continue light attack chain even dodged
important last attack combo chain free move produce stagger
whole system extremely fluid youll thinking first button game
trying ease baked gate unlimited respecs punishment build creativity
sound crazy easy w long taken studio game absolutely stunning
game compare factor visual fidelity demon soul remake know usually skip cinematics cba wukong sat every one grinning
thought level production dead game
happy see game finally release pile
worth picking full price
game play fun addicting great culmination three total war warhammer game
honest performance completely expectation
long polishing process outcome quite disappointing
ignoring existing bug assume fixed future update main issue strange feel weapon odd feedback headshot giving waxy sensation
game visuals perhaps due unfamiliarity seem tiring overly bright brightness
despite expecting adapt quickly lower graphic setting c go evident experience lack satisfying feeling go era
lastly feel like leaning towards cf added feature like throwable monitoring necessarily bad seem unnecessary adding extra layer might considered superfluous
ultimately spent entire university period game hope carry legacy trust valve refine
seen significant improvement brought source believe substantial untapped potential
keep go spread like extremely annoying
explore
get excited
lose breath looking scenery
get confident defeating first mob
meet bos
get greedy
get as handed

good lag glitch action smooth action responsive graphic good cinematic done well got higher level unlock ability get fun interface simple user friendlybad map bit linear expect dark soul elden ring exploration style level start bit slow early game bit boring map maybe really matter much map linear sometime get confuse ioverall think game worth love fighting challenging boss horrible game management company business practice
would suggest supporting game way developer correct behavior make much needed change
since want stifle bad review another one
extremely disappointed launch warhammer big fan warhammer
never quite felt good previous game show shadow change drove away game long time
however throne decay pulled back playing game ever
ca give u dlcs level polish see staying game total war community rest game life cycle
let honest wrote review gain award voice ear obese
done funding hyena etc
excellent game lovely visuals smooth fighting animation
story good engaging far easy combat though really tough boss
wait sale
ca continues fail basic level communication constant missed deadline
given recent dropping support blue inspire lot faith current project
giant crawfish enemy love meh crawfish monke stick soulslike try finger holeall fort night
died message slide dm
immortal empire absolutely incredible
warhammer bright future
far best game ever played
simple refined endless possibility
great
""
played played one
siege still abysmal ai still borderline comatose propped boring state game recently crippling older title like shogun recommend ca game
ca hate player base
black myth wukong beat game multiple ending around playtime excellent game borrowed heavily element soulsborne point could improved combat gameplay skill unlockable skill tree equivalent sekiro game spell transformation vessel spirit progress early chapter could backtrack previous even next amazing orchestrated wukong tv series version length cutscenes bossfight eyecandy something rare genre character written detail journal prepare tl dr unless storyline wished chapter felt short rush prepare fight boss within hour bit excessive subjectively statement map refer depends exploration memory also item missables throughout navigate terrain often blocked invisible wall approached edge almost superficial exploration even worse enemy knocked level back invisible wall enemy pushed weird item put reach unless using weird combo jump clipping texture empty part map also lighting glitch transitioning dark outside cave navigatecombat gameplay storyline excellent superb graphic unreal engine require latest rig order use raytracing exploration bit drawback less fun handholding invisible wall
right
hit like playable
community horrible
never liked concept game mean since like idea punishing high difficulty gameplay
tried game knowing would probably refund lack skill
one hooked exploration story
problem open world game area could disappointing explore
case game every corner map reward every curiosity tried also come price
say first fromsoftware game deeply love would recommend everyone
cutscenes gameplay character story nothing say game year doubt
pls make sure great pagoda secret dont miss guess review completion since gone back completed dark soul remastered dark soul iii almost lol got burnt started dark soul ii satisfyingly say exceptional addition series
great map lot unique interesting weapon armour weapon art much far bos fight main boss pretty cool fun fight sure filler boss mediocre feel like normal enemy bloated hp pool time normal enemy bloated hp pool lmao overall game lot fun could absolutely tell mastering year game content gg wpedit finished dsr dsii sotfs dsiii achievement steam completed demon soul amassed well hour total soul series
easily say absolute masterpiece reason took time gathered motivation complete series absolutely phenomenal become one important thing person interest
love dark soul changing perspective gaming forever
miyazaki done
game year babyyyy
another bullet another day took little nap bed whilst game open
genuinely play meaning fallen susceptible guile wily wit
personal pleasure mine ensnare subsequently deceive impudent swine frolic upon decadent game
prison section removed
everything hitboxes quite often much smaller collision box rear end bos always inducing extreme frustration hit connect collision still happens
may chaos take world
best game ever played definitely felt like back xbox day playing first space marine game fun enjoyable
ca wait get back game play
someone never anything warhammer universe usually like hack slay game prefers mmorpgs say game feel incredible
although dodge mechanic perhaps clunkiest ever gameplay lot fun especially gunplay also thanks sound design feel great
played first mission far never thought could enjoy game like much definitely recommended
loved first hour game saw game scheduled wipe lost interest playing itedit looked wipe work still agree said sure carry blueprint stuff still wipe ever would like hold
soldier god rick toughest bos soul game
beating try gave exhilaration unsurpassed game
fromsoft mastapeece
hacker ca wait bigger map ton fun entry
downside want play demon human either go ogre play
already patched troublesome bug patch bypassed problem keep agent everywhere close rift
good neat elden ring phenomenal game hard look hurdle overcome order fully enjoy initial hour game tolerable best
first area dense good filled amount copy paste containing useless loot time
felt thorough exploration appropriately rewarded
problem persisted throughout hour play became far less egregious filler content became far increase intricate world level game truly open conquer first legacy dungeon
suddenly gear actually becomes useful refreshing finally swap weapon hour game
gameplay loop exploring killing boss looting never got tiresome game give plenty opportunity experimentation trying new thing
despite abundance reused enemy still fun tackle different like every soul game devs bother explicitly tell going responded bothering pay attention story
cutscenes voice acting cool enemy extremely aggressive fast making brutal battle series
however late game boss definition artificial loading sim called noob right hacker solo queue like
""
russian doesnt know
ukranian know russian give info
pro german rage quits middle game
poor scandinavian think still win game
good game bad company
overpriced dlc almost half price game little content hate dev best good product hate
sh tty time gamer unite
need clear tolerate sh
loved game simply overpriced
even dlc barely worth
masterpiece fromsoft
loving every minute exploration combat roaming starting area
gameplay feel rewarding many path follow still sense mysticism around every everything wanted leave corporate greed butcher good game cut content overprice dlcs
knew next end time would ca making dumbass decision
screw guy
rat big men pffft another boring survival game olden circle alignment sentiment echoed community find difficult ignore evident case price gouging
disappointing witness scenario value proposition dlc soc seems mismatched cost
would greatly appreciated pricing strategy reconsidered better reflect content worth alternatively effort directed towards enriching dlc offering
could ultimately lead positive equitable experience user involved
finally spot confidently say yea go
still annoying performance bug lurking around random temporary freeze slow down like crash
thankfully really annoying enough frequent enough bothersome hamper enjoyment game review everything striked still relevant ie release
also added point post ie release honestly phenomenal game
enjoyed previous twwh game sure enjoy one well
however many issue right really recommend crashing issue detailed seems fixed still infrequent crash usually loading load finish
well several strange random slow black screen forced quit task manager two crash following
course first three hour
maybe hold stuff ironed four crash following two hour one opened tw access promt
good time
also several crash chaos realm interactive objective edit tested first two week release shortly ie release multiplayer absolutely shafted right
chug every second freeze solid second repeat
awful
also lag second clicking anything
pointless coop right
perfect people tried
apparently everyone issue keep mind
turn verifying game file actually mostly fixed introduced new issue crashing either game would initiate certain battle
issue back ie release kept issue like well bug scaling passable incredibly annoying plenty performance issue first hour original review
thankfully ca know afaik hopefully ironed long
must admit fairly disappointed game make lil sad since love total war game especially hype real one game year bought full price without second thought
complaint ar based performance stuff technical issue complaint based gameplay find comparison tedious boring
start campaing like rapidly growing snowball
within first turn secure homebase one army troop basic army epic army clash happen time
everything much less money play least kislev chaos faction hav tried others yet
barely finance one army first one province second province really change movement point lord hero scale well huge map take age get around
worst experience slaneesh take sooooo long cross land region spread take age army replenished even basic troop need something like turn geht ai often running around avoiding combat
even debuff movement speed happens often catch
ca ignore either cause lay siege province
auto calc broken atm
especially siege smaller region
need play every little battle cause otherwise loose way many tropps remember complaint replenishment rate
want fight small fight win get boring
want fight epic realm chaos stuff way tedious taste
mean great idea wish liked
worst tzeentch realm walking around kind labyrinth trying find correct portal
booooring
time homeland insecure ca remember really fund single army army away chaos even person like realm chaos bet third fifth time done well
way whatever
like maelstrom wan na kind scripted stuff chaos faction mechanic really work well looking slaneesh tzeentch
first sound super cool realize really impact expected example never saw tzeentch provoked revolt successfull
usually spawn close settlement
ai easy time crushing lord troop cause settlement troop within reach help clear stack grows major issue game right
countless small thing add
like love detail regarding map faction faction diversity
fair launched polished either
confident ca fast adressing technical gameplay issue within next month allowing enjoy game reading wan na touch melina dark soul con mundo abierto fix pvpgrapple hook class headshot deal torso damage ping shouldnt get advantage pvp hell sorcery guy come today mark day real release warhammer iiiblood blood god skull skull throne
game fine enough
ever heard played total war game talk developer
niche audience one type game
think know mostly correct
recent response community valid criticism met one worst response seen leader company
saying lot year company really let known hate selling product customer
bought total war game long time twenty three year looked
since shogun total war modern time bought played entry
stop today
creative assembly decided weigh growing list company really want money support importantly time
wo get ever
right discus privilege entitlement earn playing game
assembly trying beat activision bungie game workshop worst game company mooching government money meant uk startup massive eu company raising dlc cost posting veiled threat well cost supporting trying say buy support game
go
nice game
microtransactions
love
simple single player game
fire executive keep devs
simple
old bug dont get fixed expensive dlc
worth atm warhammer come life
environment beautiful haunting
gunplay fun melee combat fantastic found way marry two together hard
managed encourage feel like bad as space marine play like one
animation sight line amazing thing happening distance
single player campaign epic ride keep offering epic moment epic moment
impressed
fact play single player campaign couple friend amazing
multiplayer dipped little ca wait
performance fix gain fps stability disable easy anti cheat http probably bitter elden ring sold platform sabotaged
turn internet playing crazy true
somehow online portion eats ton resource
maybe sort spying software tweak video
video elden ring dramatically increase performance fps setup
best setting pc view increase fps eldenring best setting pc spec optimize elden ring fps fix lag reduce input latency stutter best better fps
ca run game even lowest setting
tweak
run game high max wont recommend method cut online mode performance super poor
stuttering lot cause inconsistent frame world loading particle effect take huge hit fps also poor open world area
fps low setting gtx tree flickering pop even look good even max setting
know need much resource maybe deal card maker
added fsr alleviate fps issue hey probably sell card without open world game like assassin creed odyssey phantom pain death stranding etc etc work flawlessly release looked better well ton goinf
fromsoft game always issue
hey fix later right rebind separately sprint dodge
walk button also always forgotten type console auto center wont ever toggle turn type port still defend game end u fault devs babied fan year
happening constantly every release game
never learn enabled reviewer leaf stuff set aside want backlash ton fan game game wrong apologetic issue blame victim
religion year
death closest friend immortal empire update finally immortal empire map glorious
every region got nothing cut mean mortal empire map longer squished add wh map top without cutting anything
total campaign performance better expected since wh reworked graphic still need recources wh warrior chaos rework awesome
faction finally fun diffrent faction though need new dlc full experience worth top belakor got added free faction patch brought faction wh standarts though balance issue looking infinite healing cap zombie game bug way less expect
havent anything major beta tag discourage enjoying game major issue though thats ai passiveness higher difficulty confederation beeing way hard player ai
confirmed adress confederation ai surely fixed fun still need work look like going right direction
continues like end ultimate combined experience fan crave
yo father probably one oldest people playing game
single farther son
son got game installed computer started playing
end week hour game
horrible already hard find way spend time son always friend watching youtube
decided make steam account get game see could maybe play alongside
loaded game made character world started playing stuck supposed
asked son help hosted game join
loved best time spent son since wife died
game ever since brought son closer actually spend time together outside house together well
game reminded fun everything brought son many happy memory knew chaplain smelled like game helldivers needed
helldivers doom gameplay narrative campaign havent played enough everything else judge
without dark light purposewithout lie truth purposewithout war victory purposewithout death sacrifice purposewithout hope future purposewithout loyalty one chapter purposewithout emperor nothing would purpose total war greedflationupdate getting better
steam something thumb give continue deliver good patch
far best representation space marine larger extent game ever played
gameplay might take get used get hang flow quite well
sound good well
bolter round flying crashing onto bunch enemy satisfying crunch
story honestly average ultramarine story
""
viewed standalone story decent story leave wanting learn
overall would give would highly recommend fan warhammer action game general
waiting able play game properly year
apperantly gon na happen horrible release followed horrible live service gon na buy dlcs absurd price
guess keep collecting dust steam library forever sega known learning mistake
awesome
u need buy
operation missiondo really wellchill new brotherssave brother operationsreach last encounter leftconnection lost error code really good game like offline progress better server least remove people operation mission disconnected
downside getting repetitive played every single mission campaign included
campaign started online mission basically play get reward buy perk new upgrade weapon customization
mission take long aswell varying difficulty multiple reward six mission type enemy get boring
still game worth playing thing need variety regarding enemy type mission

real game come tomorrow
let grudge grudge book
monke good fromsoftwares greatest hit video game
took everything previous game added open world reward exploration creativity
one best game played past year
good game hate invisible wall frustrating
mention adore game ca recommend anyone buy
dev straight pretending dlc oil pricing accordingly
ridiculous charge dollar dlc even add much
remember ikit claw dlc warhammer
""
rocked
felt worth
got new unique lord subfactions play
""
get lord dollar
instead releasing dlc balance game
give tiny amount people give money
free mod balance better update ca make game
ridiculous
making essentially game since tw still figured balance certain faction
top constant price hike show give zero player
people bought previous game one pissed buying treated
review would swap thumb really fast actually stopped constantly increasing price dlc
bet lot others would
gon na add review hopelessly broken balance
almost wish would stop updating fan made mod overhaul every single lord good go date time devs ca make another broken useless update fix nothing
funny warhammer game though wish many dlc item showcase clearing stage hour feel like big something missing quite disappointing rest game look feel excellent story telling choice combat main aspect game ca really bring play electric frog bos early second feel like impact striking opponent peon weak die quickly get satisfying final hit combo feel like waste use fully charged heavy quickly dispatch satisfying fighting bos feel like flea using cqc ox
relying rinse repeat every single time many encounter feel repetitive nature scratching away really wanted like game beautiful illustration effort description yaoguai know picky obvious invisible wall seems tad lazy quality see many area
feel like example mile wide inch deep come level design
beautiful know open world game like creativity come blocking stunning unintrusive ui many mechanic play con flat feeling early repetitive nature absolutely recommend game
big fan free play game
however like survival game
played big one
game probably one ever played
top even game super dense content ad playing face feel like pay advance
decent amount hour game feel like one people game play since hell diver
top game came level thought content game mindful
lot annoying misess game tend exist one
thing like individually loot item ground able easily see leave around rebuild base scratch
game feel extremely well thought seems like built player
also implement live service system somehow suck
make rewarding fun come back game week week
also way worried messing
always come back week late collect reward prior week
level respect shown player game show little game show
also respect grind give bonus certain time work little bit
also enough content feel like ever stuck grind
always something unlocked explored
would satisfied spending game
way would believe free
wondering game mixed review get much hate
tos stated id may linked game
western world problem exempt
however country china requirement law
tos address
however lot western reader tos obviously flagged problem
however acknowledged exempt problem
resulted game getting massive review bomb blatantly deserve
black monkey first game teammate teach racist xenophobic people say learn anything video game huh game campaign criminally short id expect game price range mere hour single run whole lot replayability probably one best title term attention detail art direction game
tell map builder artist whole lot passion behind work
amazing graphic game content
disappointing game since big fan total war game general total war warhammer ii particular really expected love game
however broken betrayal product worth time money present jones race soul fragmentsthe rift chaos realm opening could interesting addition game
however way game work win game entering rift collecting soul fragment
could interesting sort dynamic story challenge fact every faction thing meaning even playing whole game turn race soul fragment early one noticed
angry joe noted killed campaign review skip video total war warhammer iii angry review view http join http new merch http angryjoe get touch inner demon rule mandalore gaming noted basically make winning way almost impossible
video total war warhammer review view total war warhammer arrived month absolutely stacked game
review cover anything everything came mind prepare tree menu
worse rift entered faction leader mean winning game creating doomstacks using play basically bad moba rather coordinating army managing kingdom would say actual total war game
broken storythis game one awful story clearly put together people worked separately hated
instance story clearly state certain person enter realm chaos thing needed win game literally every ai faction actually first chance get
characterization also
instance kostaltyn sympathetic character cutscenes ugly deranged blowhard campaign map
terrible performance denuvokeep tolerating bug devs unreliable total war game played far issue might expect including broken ai ca move properly constant multiplayer course crash frequently cause lose progress tough battle impossible tell many problem linked use denuvo certainly first total war game posted negative review playing series since early
game made sad current status tww iii
quite simple describe
shiny outside rotten core
take closer look see
apparently many capable honest problem price
something completely month numerous bug really changed better
hour new patch seen problem even worsened case
especially siege
""
still invisible enemy ai completely stupid deployment city
ungrim ironfists journey end still work
waaagh
orc ai faction battle still working
pathfinding siege still incredibly bad
still
also seems performance campaign map worsened
movement vampirates seems buggy also rite vampirates
frigg want list everything dlc look really good great put resource new stuff like intel thing instead fixing old known see point buying dlc
fact wo buying dlc something improves term endless bug
case new stuff relevant right encourage everyone reconsider buying habit
god sake stop everything
one reason quality getting worse every get act together even bigger already
long nothing change recommend today nothing fundamentally changed
today official statement ca
guess wait new patch updating review
make team fortress
ahem ca greedy as pracitices
dont buy company unless ridiculous sell even maybe
company want vaguely threat audience biggest ip siphon money new ip yea ca im sure hyena make gorillions dollar
tw warhammer dy cuz uwu audience didnt buy overpriced dlc lul rest peace good run
modders fix like fixed game
cope seethe sneed ca great game definitely worth money playtime
huge world explore hundred hour great game
yes
masterpiece
totally people say either still honeymoon phase left starting zone game lot content explore
world building level design lore best soul series
gorgeous view super complex domain get lost
lot secret surprise exploring open world
least first couple quality dip bit around half game open world area start feel generic field stuff thrown applies well bos design
quality dip second half game notable design problem
first lack originality since every bos basically moveset every bos big aoe oneshots every bos throw puddle around arena every bos grab attack oneshots every bos anime multihitting unrollable dash need run away also one people disliked ganks got bad news cause past midpoint game started early game boss face bos fight straight bugged clunky
boss big fit room fighting making glitch wall floor boss fight open world get bugged height change terrain making glitch rock interested pvp duel much going
covenant gone invasion work host playing coop
day review several instant kill cheap build ruining scene hopefully get give
great game specially want get soul game since open world design allows take easy progress somewhere else get stuck plus several new system added make game accessible
also sadly lowered quality bos fight biggest appeal
masterpiece
beautiful art great gameplay
even though game quite linear game world massive large variety unique boss
boss relatively easy tough require practice
lot different skill unlock item collect fun character meet
fix bug add content proportional price charge
following black myth wukong since first footage reveal development
watched summary adaptation journey west game far artistic beautiful tribute mythology
story little confusing unless knowledge wukong lore animation inbetween chapter clear wonderful true ending really neat requires alot thing done beating secret boss certain bad alot cool move bos quality variable sometimes annoying boss sometimes fun challenging one
looking guide helpful understand go build
versatile upgrade need say anything else unreal engine displayed wonderfully vibrant realistic graphic could happier performance top notch heartfelt certain would give better score bos quality consistent
one modern aaa game buy full price get huge amount hour per dollar dark soul ramped
world bigger weapon crazier boss b move sooooo much find game
go thinking easier game straight away
easier mechanical gameplay reason
easier bypass roadblock go exploring find material weapon get level much easier previous soul game
actual fight still challenging require spend time learning bos attack game design overall still hard fair aware fair mean utilise much broken stuff enemy utilising often hamstring still super tight design much larger scale beast absolutely amazing game play
elden ring pc technical mess ca recommend
world boss core gameplay look great issue simply unacceptable age gaming
cap ridiculous unfortunately even stable seems unachievable
ryzen rtx encountered fps drop stuttering unresponsive frustrating navigate menu
reason show playstation controller input xbox controller k
bother playing k insane delay acceleration make unplayable
also less important mentioned game awful
need use finger group regroup whenever boss enter dungeon
progression host run every party member group locked
know system dark soul new ip advertised expected much better system
really disappointing improved year
really disheartening see direction ca taking dlc late
even extra work put campaign feature shadow change feel like dlc cost instead given amount unit add
price could justified least added unit generic even though content currently dlc amazing price incredibly overbearing
deeply hope ca look community outcry something learn
throne decay well hope least go extra mile creating unit generic make worth price
purchased every dlc entire game series going purchase newest shadow change dlc every one even increased price
developer decided threaten continue development franchise people purchase increased price lord pack
really dropped ball herethey changed course added value dlc putting hour week total hour many hour going eventually
im holding hope halflings added
game fun like type game want push different play style mechanic
try different race huge fan total war series ever since shogun total war
made first warhammer total war moon followed improved warhammer total war warhammer total war live previous installment
launch failure filled bug new campaign took worst mechanic previous game made worse timed rush soul siege rework improvement
adding deployable tower wall settlement doesnt add game rather subtracts
whilst enemy marching gate setting men busy either trying locate tower wall build ignoring mechanic entirety
ai changed game worse
feel dumb passive regard also thing ludicrous enemy moving army way across map enemy territory assault price new dlc worth money ask
huge price increase signal avoid buying stick previous installment
interested wait go sale addicted tww
also addicted tww good
immortal empire need released soon keep attention
mod definitely helping especially turning chaos realm enough long term
ie must soon
blown well game capture power fantasy controlling space marine remember receiving first fig middle school nearly year ago
game capture imagined space marine would like
worth owning visceral experience title
purge xenos game meh look monkey
stick
somehow enough take massive mythical beast god
sure make graphic
yeah good
probably best thing since weather apps replaced looking window
combat
something fall
either way died time frog
frog even bos
frog
would recommend anyone enjoys suffering disguised banana try finger hole agreed net ease tos first born
crash performance issue game great
really feel like implemented community wish faction mechanic unique much really looking forward new content espically mortal empire buy basicaly casino
fantastic game load fun even better dlc
total war community great streamer content creator enhance overall value game
looking forward remaining dlcs game year fun
love wukong one favorite mythical story inspired dragon ball literally childhood able play story driven myth creature awesome personally pc year old omen handle well tweaking setting pc struggling nexusmods improvement could help go google type black myth wukong nexus mod
hope help
shameful dlc politic among u monke best diversity exclusivity game
mmm monke narrative campaign keep getting worse way actually playing game
monkey bug visuals limited community interaction limited lord pack higher price hard recommend product received free honestly fantastic game worth game visually fantastic level design breath taking
massive background going linear level huge battle going
genuinely great quite twist end feel like going lead customization pretty great
able customize space marine known chapter creating chapter make incredibly genuinely fun
limit class play
ca wait see plan add negativity game
operation
alright simply another campaign go along main campaign add context pretty fun
immersion though think space marine tough luck
still seen ultramarine
actual main downside operation opinion locking class player chosen first
see reason game like darktide allow
get class apparently actual character ultramarine chapter irritating block
two brother want class neither wish change forcing third player stand wait one decides finally leave lobby
amazing game brings huge win warhammer franchise really hope good life future content
incredibly looking forward horde mode
monke
game good god war
genuinely look incredible
play pretty good
minor exception boss fair usually beaten changing loadout
farm ca outlevel boss like
nearly every game huge technical problem lead cpu usage certain perfect still fun hurtboxes atrocious even worse dark soul still take away fun fun game
steam need add review thing recent developer publisher ca right mind support ca finding stuff today never really liked sega crap pull
basically publisher suck though highly enjoy game actually able play fact likely last game buy series assuming even get made
two previous game probably
half dlc
bought ogre kingdom game well
even though dlc though literal race play time dwarf time karaz karak rune guy bottom map lol
dont real actually get dlcs supporting development
bought dlcs wanted support devs think time stop even mindset
everyone buying dlcs money devs go company pay whatever pay
show big company worth making dlc worth making new game help individual developer
developer pour blood game get anything salary big corporate game like want half finished game stuff keep going like aa aaa space need stop allowing
need vote wallet
""
extra money launch
nothing
many people know formerly back seem feel buying random dlc like tipping restaurant
programmer artist etc never see money unless company make god get pittance bonus
love devs
greedy marketing branch branding branch aswell greedy ceo etc
ty hope devs make studio legit one worst game time
rate even high let explain systemthere need explain bad
bad people getting banned instantly using skinchanger friend mine got overwatch banned even vac
month started cheating
good job valve
oh btw public hack even pay single cent communityit cancer overall
seriously many people community either toxic ca speak english trolling around thinking fun
lost many rank match c nt speak language even speak yes people even talk
kill someone cheeky way called cheater instantly
matchmaking systemlet explain playing people mate aswell queue opponent
basically meant competitive
case match make rage hard neighbour call police
ranking take win row win game row rank global rank rank lose happened mate mine
absolute bullsh even bother trying tick extreme lag hitreg server delay enough cancer
bug weird wtf
""
example used glitch spammed buy bind spawned spectator
matchmaking ffs
glitch volvo still care add sh tty glove know valve itselfas mentioned earlier give sh anything community say
used care community back skin even added added
legit better rifle
dollar pistol
took month nerf nerfed hard rekt added revolvo
pocket awp
stats awp nerfed day later
clear valve give sh anyone
kept adding stuff like graffiti glove new skin still care anything
updated negev
great conclusion please play
worth time
without doubt best choice best use farm animal category steam autumn chicken rule world
probably best game played
nearly two year since release ca done pretty damn close nothing term maintenance game
still buggy sh tshow patch less frequent ever
worst part could let slide game still fun occasionally ramping dlc price nearly double cost previously said dlc less content ca give incessant greed laziness
heresy detected get reasoning behind war game cut three player mac kill c go actually ready tourney level play going ayup like play fat uncle well nice knocker make poo moat around house make small green nephew poke enemy stick
sometimes bloke get served chip fight gotten mardy
proper chuffed
ogreguyswithcathaywives super fun enjoy game every expansion feel game becomes even unstable infested bug
replaying multiple battle game keep crashing loading screen becomes exhausting
immortal empire fun total war since medieval pleasantly surprised open world mmo type survival base buildingvariety interesting actual mechanicsaverage gunplay combati think set game apart week server cycle character transition along new event idea since live service online evolving world
cycle information take minute read comprehend
playing cycle half still enjoying new difficulty look forward new map coming month
people lootboxes give cosmetic want monetize completely free game
would rather pay level boost backpack expansion
right way right terrrible
least like gameplay visuals
thing make low tier d clone game mostly bos rush fighting boss arent fun
little downtime boss
mostly spam dodge since bad tell combat floaty dodge arent
good second okay think delay getting dodge immortal weapon nioh immobalize spell use boss time waiting come back online
light heavy attack light attack take muuuch longer finish try use light attack time dodge reset combo
also bos ability hit bigger area visual indicate go invulvuable bad part arena attack faster intended cant even dodge spam avoid took ability let negate incomming dmg heavy strike combo dosent seem boss also elden ring bos design stop mid swing hit momentum dident tracking lot time bos half visible side screen dodging attack past thenso ting would consider bad
isent anything good except mytholigy bos visuals new
shovelware

c
compared source game definitely hold
perfect excellent date version multiplayer classic view still finest multiplayer fps world
couple update release immortal empire way better
decided change recommended previous reviewi spent hundred hour playing total war warhammer ii
bought every single dlc previous game
naturally preordered third game trusting creative assembly release something even better
unfortunately wrong
third game feel like unfinished early access run much worse without real improvement design awful feel cluttered look worse previous content creating multiplayer lobby managed get fixed somehow never wh coop campaign fun feel like lacking real variety unit guess solved dlcs previous game yet hope update make game better recommend buying
good
good back basic game fun win buying game worth waiting year immortal empire released patch come game heard game pretty sorry state launch
despite many flaw finally managed total warhammer series yet
made complete multiple warhammer series like slow cooked brisket looking back predecessor happy see far come
warhammer inspired many u promise vast trilogy capturing entire fantasy world chaos
warhammer built legacy
ca finally found stride newfound freedom experiment host wacky inspiring faction mechanic
yet time passed historical total war title released warhammer started feel dated
lacklustre diplomacy seemingly abandoned multiplayer mode tedious siege vortex campaign could never find much reason care face immortal empire sandbox
staggering faction mod would spent much time finally introduced many qol improvement desperately needed enthusiasm siege map lord speech diplomacy improvement beautiful visuals faction unique theme music unique faction mechanic simultaneous turn multiplayer campaign mode stand head prequals
highlight thus far multiplayer campaign potential mode grows promise immortal empire campaign
find engaging way unable achieve
time precious new multiplayer tool available ensure battling friend fighting alongside never better easier
improvement come without downside
unit responsiveness number uninspiring technology predictable ai campaign objective time feel forced intrusive tarnish otherwise excellent experience
said person hundred campaign ended prematurely cultivated finale refreshing opposed time directionless mess immortal empire
enjoyed experience thus far eagerly awaiting release immortal empire campaign
go without saying delivery immortal empire campaign could make break series
regardless outcome however blast dabbling ca rendition warhammer fantasy world
portrayal vast comprehensive something unlikely experience ever careful detail
done right well
fan even looking hobby game play
get live space marine fantasy
pure chaotic fun
yes chaotic also
space marine v tyranids spoiler bloody messy bloody messy fun
good enough lol epitome trilogy
instead crippled since launch game breaking bug broken promise uninspiring disagreeable campaign mechanic inconsequential difficulty community wish blatantly immortal empire grand campaign moment
champion chaos forge chaos dwarf dlc welcome addition albeit stiff price increase
year half later still feel like unpolished product yet latest dlc price surged arguably less content
creative assembly even hinting empty threat drop support cash cow sale follow customer deserve better seems total war community coming around idea recent riot forum
elden schmung monke gf bought game best game ever buy game better game
game tweaked work well immortal empire delivered experience wanted start

enjoying game offer
hit miss need work checked pve pvp quirk kbm setup really weird really user friendly situation
controller bad support ultrawide screen
look like gaming lcd monitor year
instead little boxy window type setup using full screen would make game rating played masterpiece effortlessly blend breathtaking visuals exhilarating combat captivating narrative
moment stepped vibrant world inspired journey west completely immersed
game graphic simply stunning
every detail lush forest intricate architecture rendered meticulous care
element game animation cutscenes music ui portrait gameplay equally want really feel hype play game highest possible graphic setting high cinematic pc spec allows would suggest play game maybe year current gpus upgrade difficulty selection game experience may vary easy difficult progress throughout chapter
despite struggle enjoyed trial error learning combo perfect dodge attack timing bos attack
took hour finish game includes secret chapter yes including secret ending boss created equally quite annoying term hit box yep looking daoist master prick
still enjoyed trying learn adapt different attack tempo mechanic changing playstyle situation need
overall think bos encounter good dodge mechanic also like game kind maneuver pull need get hit dodge dodging get hit kind thing give sense fulfillment everytime learning attack timing bos
alternatively different staff allows parry dodge varies also really cool
although used quite personal preference added armor weapon fairly balanced game situational vary playstyle armor give unique effect without wear set
overall really game story adapted journey west novel entirety really need read novel understand story since game take different route franchise hence part name black myth atleast observed game take place event novel animation cutscenes really exceeded expectation balance amount cutscenes actual gameplay give immersion chinese level design every detail meticulously created lush forest intricate architecture simply cant stress enough exploring really pay game
either reward upgrade secret bos encounter definitely huge w people overall despite experience playing game lower fps mostly unstable think really outweighs level effort game developer poured game term graphic really pushed limit unreal engine point technical limitation game engine
commendation solely graphic aspect game well quality animation cutscenes music level design delivered exceeds fan game chinese mythology
game leave lasting impression breathtaking visuals exhilarating combat captivating narrative
excellent game god war vibe product received free hour bad game masterpiece
forced race faction rather able play pace

tale modern gaming developer publisher
taking beautifully game clearly product equal part passion skill slowly choking promise life corporate greed
surprised
everywhere today gaming
fascinating greed killing company world could sated good decision
could little hard work cake eat
know happening
business side company made determination raising price reducing content ignoring bug focusing new content profitable efficient method business
less work money
company need profit survive
model thinking grossly
would ask stakeholder company following question preferred
increase profit next fiscal year due horrific understanding consumer base game dy vine player count population consumer future content decrease point longer viable continue supporting game within two slow increase profit per quarter next fiscal year shoring foundation consumer loyally purchase every release content entire game
additionally community relation ensure next game franchise eagerly anticipated continuing grow company exponentially
everyone picking first option even considering second even though would profitable decision welcomed consumer
problem business side company understand money made
succeed business spitting face customer spend hundred dollar product name quarterly earnings
may survive financially see another quarter
succeed doubling thing made successful first place attention detail understanding community communicating openly working tirelessly within company produce culture effort rather content generation read bug fix community engagement medium quality dlc equal measure rather current dlc rush
circle growth
consumer see want see
consumer spends money product company produce
money used payroll employee increase wealth grow company produce content vein consumer want see
enough analysis
anyone company reading provide data point analysis
wo draw conclusion
wo tell stopped playing
tell little matter bought company exactly stopped purchased every single item total war warhammer franchise except shadow change dlc
purchased full price many
time review hour record whiii
hour
every single total war title franchise except throne britannia troy stopped playing whiii noticed animation witch hunter free company militia share animation set completely broken
year ago
simply put mouth open move pistol floating magically belt hand swapping idle attack eventually sword invisible
despite reported multiple user steam forum never even added known issue list
eventually fix pushed bring sword back shove pistol model
day grip pistol horribly clipped thumb hand nothing done address broken mouth rig
purchased forge chaos dwarf never played aforementioned bug addressed noticed favorite hero unit favorite faction broken became frustrating purchase shadow change
go
analyze away
might stopped playing
could linkage terrible community relation profit
could seemingly minor cosmetic bug really cause someone stop playing
could ignoring issue like despite multiple report video evidence create perception caring player base powerful drive decision purchase future content
could time little thing create success
could really kill dollar franchise thousand player like
get money think everyone win
included
wish nothing best

oo oo aa aa ruined videogames gave gambling addiction worst part even good like hate soul game overly difficult always working player give elden ring try might end loving much getting review like give opinion merit saying played hour demon soul made decent progress played lord fallen steam soft game gave sekiro try hated
also played bit demon soul also tried game soul mechanic care one bit exception star war jedi fallen order multiple difficulty loved beginning mind let get elden ring ring single best action rpg ever played bar none
even took time platinum game pretty much never
sure shortcoming overall experience simply unmatched order keep clean easy understand post pro con gamepros stunning art direction game look like moving painting every turn
awe beginning even though game rather sparse vague storytelling stick quest line actually going relate character sweet
little dialogue yet well written acted enough make player care game full amazing random moment would even think could incredible epic amazing bos fantastic gameplay work player unlike soul game everything screw player essentially infinite healing item increase get stronger explore weapon armor break
maintaining equipment ruined many game including demon soul even breath wild still finished botw least frequent checkpoint checkpoint every major specifically dedicated farm zone make leveling breeze also checkpoint right next world full content yet never felt overwhelming boring much less like kind checklistsense discovery like game genuinely happy excited discover new dungeon place item character vista everything well put together brilliant eerie somber music ambience fit world satisfying sound effect sound main character make walk roll around weapon clash hit everything perfect
headphone game sound help gameplay elden ring let player make mistake experiment fight take risk without punishing wasting time something soul game docons quest line could clearly outlined imo unless follow quest guide pretty much chance discovering progressing quest boss idiotic mainly form final bos form one bos tho dealt summoning two player help withmaking complicated get three ending single file console user fortunately pc nonissue terrible clunky movement jumping sadly come play optional areasmost spell armor item weapon fairly useless worth using pretty unable respec unlimited number time need respec item used two believe would much fun could infinitely play build
also need find item tho seem found without trying thatmy final rating absolutely amazing experience marred final bos phase still strongly dislike soul game following reason none present much elden ring even slightest mistake mess run soul game elden hp mp healing item cost soul soul take time farm choice farm game essentially make dying set back beginning level opened shortcut cool level fighting damn enemy tedious choice
meaning either perfect mess end wasting healing item die end segment try play plenty retro game give far room mistake average soul demon soul example love putting player small narrow space enemy
melee good luck becuase sword bounce wall camera decides mess even worse
elden ring rarely
tho camera issue elden ring well nothing major
iirc die demon soul example difficult game becomes something world tendency getting darker ca confirm sure elden ring none stuff
first die good pve expected pvp well effect proc thru roll pulling roll stronger dark soul shieldpoke move us shield defense unlike dark soul would weapon exist pretty feel somehow worse dark soul easy anticheat suspect hyperarmor like passive poise extremely annoying play step quickstep given permanent brain anticheat done nothing actually prevent cheater harming innocent player malcolm already shooting people death beam sitting unable make pvp build minute cheat engine like used dark soul balance issue pointless complain since theoretically patched almost week people running around immolation glitch still hasnt even released statement itthere good thing yes instead refining dark soul rather ok flawed decided reinvent thing already fine back thenalso game run like as lol easier miyazaki gameawesome animation effectscutscenes even betternone game journey westbosses interaction character another lvl especially last main bos secret bos game awesome community utter trash
game filled ragers troller griefers cheater
real attempt curtailing behaviour report system might aswell exist
buy mortal empire released yo father probably one oldest people playing game
single father son
son got game christmas uncle installed computer started playing
end week hour game
horrible already hard find way spend time son always friend watching youtube
decided make steam account get game see could maybe play alongside
loaded game picked character world started playing stuck supposed
asked son help hosted game join
loved best time spent son since wife died
game ever since brought son closer actually spend time together outside house together well
game reminded fun everything brought son many happy memory
painful write review since play total war game since rome total war yet go
order someone enjoy everything game offer pay seriously amazing get enabled get far
well
thinking thing get better every broken release rewarded money kept going going without fixing bug addressing balance faction first warhammer total war released back bug yet fresh installment franchise u exited come
came first dlcs alarming hype still release warhammer total war added couple faction new campaign get interesting
every title franchise would core game like age charlemagne attila total war yet majority accepted something like yes awful
came extra dlcs additional lord also overpriced yet people still found review back funny even time stated obvious missing feature many year still without mod random crash battle random crash changing awful siege battle outer wall like decoration inner tower like joke pretty weird since created empire total war could place tower manned missile troop extra barricade unit order actually feel ground awful battle optimization create doomstack strong missile unit good go even enemy armored knight infantry since ai weird focusing lord awful bonus ai battle map campaign mean played someone us cheat would stop playing yet almost every total war title exception ai probably beat cheating play hard ai outsmart get bonus beat challenging
thought strategy game finding fitting strategy overcome formation troop like shield wall testudo schiltron pike phalanx fire rank long requested mix melee missile unit useful starting troop counter beast meaningful upgrade unit feel experience bonus like joke real impact battle go technology buff visual unit upgrade armory like medieval total war like attila technology awful balance faction counter strategy certain lord accordance lore warhammer universe think almost khorne hero yet game well actually know poor compatibility mod workshop
sometimes modders fault time come new patch mod need reworked order governing system race missing one empire still fixed electoral faction almost acting without able allied end day lost costumer since never buy another title insist money grabbing practice game perfect area improve
however almost new game compared release total war warhammer
decent state
generally gameplay fun improved post release development happened
dlc expensive
get least dlc enjoy play
game faction ie cost bit
assume end dev phase lot aware going
there way test faction dlc try buy function price add
however gameplay fun good visuals world campaign lot
ai need bit work even getting good point
dlc team well consistently good work
enjoy total war least strategy game something offer
return monke moment played warhammer hour around total war warhammer
fun playing game resent dlc pricing huge amount bug make dlc unplayable left recommend game
need mod named community bug fix play paid content solved bug current build
main issue wait next dlc drop come fix huge amount bug
even guaranteed going fix bug
fun game literally threatening playerbase good business move
bajie goat honest normally post review lurker
many many year since played singleplayer title completion usually call quits sold within first min finished bm wukong entirety achievement completed one best title past decade
hey curious anyone else
every day take shower like turn water super hot hold nut hand let scalding hot water run ball extremely itchy reason instead itching burn scalding hot water relieve itching quite possibly amazing sensation ever felt life
feel amazing less damage skin scratch
careful hot water hitting hand thigh hurt really bad difficult let scalding hot water hit nut nothing else
itching gotten less intense day go treatment seems know weird telling feel incredible
saying people try got itch perhaps better alternative burn scalding hot water
c go eats soul run
quitted game review journey worth every secondgood game hooked like found immersed five day straight
combat exhilarating graphic stunning story best seen
however straightforward game
fully appreciate narrative need background chinese mythology particularly classic tale journey west
watch youtube video get speed worth bos fight particular nothing short spectacular
one unique challenging utterly insane
best erlangggggggg bos fight
fight hr straight
time theme play head go music also deserves special mention
soundtrack perfectly complement action story heightening emotional impact key scene
music team absolutely nailed delivering hype tension exactly game nearly flawless technical issue frustrating
occasionally encountered glitch required quick restart fix
minor inconvenience something hope get patched overall game masterpiece absolutely worth price
storytelling combat graphic music come together create unforgettable experience
even minor technical hiccup solid book
fan mythology looking game consume time best possible way
china social credit score black myth wukong changed changed better man watching journey destined one realised monkey great
nothing compare c go old game today standard still best
final review csgo end era
ultrawuide fov refund server wipe abysmal ca keep stuff work put
paid battle pas lol last dlc really turned around ton hotfixes
game amazing especially mod freea crazy concept people invented
game primarily carried modders unrecognised
community complaint ai braindead ignored
army afk fire awaiting reinforcement
unethical dlc pricing policy half entire game put new legendary lord one new spin mechanic already existing game mechanic charged twice previous dlc added new race multiple mechanic
got chicken badge good world oce server yet stay away
monkey good hell yes
hour binge day ti awesome every way
music alone mwah earlier game dlc race etc
available really shine newly released update immortal empire campaign
absolutely well worth
super fun super challenging want epic every way
zooming troop watching demolish get demolished never get old
cinematic f
ti time war
huzzah
point refunded game mortal empire campaign workshop support
probably barebones total warhammer release far lack content lack diversity content suffers performance issue
performance issue due strange choice ca use denuvo
wonder came first people disastrous launch every time release game people pirating game release
seems could resolve piracy woe releasing game finished rather game performance denuvo
game fantastic hack slash dramatic visuals
highly recommend game old fan new
small compliants
control little unorthodox opinion
impossible figure
odd ball
could easily rectified game menu key binding
ultra wide support opinion disappointing new game easily rectified future update game
great game
finally two year slogging painfully poor optimization lackluster content update inane design decision finally recommend game
sort
game still massive issue
pathing unit bit borked particularly siege battle
siege longer overbearing still great long slogs get
still many noteworthy bug
recently started skaven campaign realize turn entire lord option missing ui restart campaign scratch somehow fixed issue
massive terrain deformation ranged unit little dance acknowledge new attack order plenty
thing much better state year ago ca seem committed fixing game adding new better stuff
content update shadow change throne decay dlcs lot appealing
complete warhammer fantasy experience positive begun outweigh negative significantly
ca still lot work love warhammer strategy probably wo find robust game get still probably wait sale
good game best point click game
homies hate price hike trait veiled threat public order yes buy dlc unless discount even creative assembly actually said keep buying release going keep increasing price
litterally said willing milked milk
use money control behaviour
pay bad product
game rough launch likely rushed recovered time lord pack kind getting hand game worst annoying build snapping system
good game fun people sometimes insult english good ok play well respect
immortal empire game worth
cant recommend game dlc policy one game ever made
dumbest dev cap server player based registered player cap concurrent player making player abandon server becuz cant play friend making fully registered server one playing
monke become monke basically game throne game seemed going good direction past two dlcs new development curving away positive trajectory quite significantly
game still buggy pace bugfixes tied dlcs far slow
latest dlc short content particularly pricey feel particularly bad
switching back review negative think good time get game right
wait see definitely wait sale going get reference old review champion chaos dlcwith release immortal empire new narrative campaign champion chaos fix autoresolve bias game recovered disastrous launch
got ta wait workshop get essential mod transferred must sequel reference old review launch probably better time
least mod workshop got activated modders fix game final verdict pretty much done itching something new find sale get money worth time
done wait bigger weird launch hugely anticipated sequel one best game series ever
everyone high expectation since total war warhammer done well release recent dlcs
unfortunately team dropped ball many aspect game implementation narrative engaging
wait rift lose legendary lord race soul format hugely biased ai tzeentch worse attrition nurgle realm battle two major faction bias finally get get pretty flavorless reward boon tied identity soul ca
someone succeeds first wasted time get kicked except tzeetch realm mapped part
god change realm surprisingly static next try faster reciprocity game mechanic many mechanic campaign far punishing hand ai player
glaring favor ai much forced fight meaningless battle get army unit army
wiped clearly inferior opponent
waiting load time fight boring battle good experience
add game difficulty either tedium
bias also stupidly strong
faction stuff nurgle plague effective player ai recruit army nowhere barely suffers attrition rarely relies replenishment devastating player fewer army generally try lose unit normally relies replenishment
similarly changing way absolutely unfun yielded ai
spend next turn anything
come bombardment easily dodged ai spell
devastating player ca keep eye everything
list go building design balance
building useless far useful
overall selection bloated building upgrade often worth
ex
khislev market gold gold income increase
take turn useful
probably something better gold right benefit much sooner tech tree design balance
tech tech tree far superior others
big difference choice good meaningless
present different quality many bug problem
fun game play already overly common minor settlement battle
ability working
awesome voice docking area trap nerf archer

look game certain thing well though faction identity graphic still decent game
barely stage launched still worse current state predecessor
overall seems like ca spent lot time working engine stuff graphic little making sure game actually fun play
work ok look good release
need money patch later maybe
russian make game terrible valve lock russian play instead ruining game experience u able speak english communicate
spataluski cyka bliet cyka cyka
russian player wish steam option review gameplay fun think worth price current level content
fairly short mission campaign operation mission play alongside main campaign barebones pvp mode okay
combat good bit janky especially melee combat
control scheme great mouse keyboard obviously designed console controller mind
weird bug including model becoming invisible connection issue trying play operation friend appreciate still early day likely fixed
almost definitely come back game future add content currently far expensive get
feel like fairy playing pro gameplay loop solid
building addicting already feel like base dream home lvl
progression relatively quick
decent challenge completing event higher level certain boss playing solo
believe monetization predatory
nothing bugged
charm
fun
event happen world people congregate whup sum s
extremely fun privacy system security concern due kernel level anticheat
ordinary anymore unfortunately
problem well gon na probably love
want music radio
feel like song burrowed brain need keep pet stay happy
gibe moar musak enormous cat say
feel like chore developer come room throw paint wall say reset map feel fresh
graphicsyup good graphic
scenery underlying scenario good enough hurt much story absolute dog poop
literally two character game everyone else act like mannequin first character woman named mitsuko dressed white heavily selling combination damsel distress amnesiac demure
except work
incredible psychic power never actually real danger cross dimension gross creative director leaned modeler shoulder told make look like make shirt every slightly transparent
creepy obviously supposed make player want protect aggravating
player never given reason care person story keep trotting along main character expressing ever trying express badly story written
divorced reality event around
stake never
like awful star war prequels keep getting told narrative character feel never shown reason back
completely tuned
slog get story section
overstate uninteresting story game second character robot bird thing always around
voice actor good job
amnesiac thing super attempted given story adding group like rosetta mayfly vulture
talked completely indistinct
every single group member simply stand around shoot get close
look guy wearing torn jacket behaving exactly like every npc
incredible environmental story telling forgive bad story
bad story mean developer thought little intelligence assumed could shovel nonsense trope still spend money woman tight clothes spent almost entire budget lot special core gameplay loop run around collecting thing shooting enemy craft better gear survive next area
generally enjoyable two main type area
bos arena weapon done receiving random drop rare crafting weapon
crafting upgrading weapon requires blue print rarer blueprint entry point taking real world money
punishing durability aspect weapon encourages spend time money getting weapon gathering material repair weapon keep gathering thing impressed many distinct feature interface shoved game
reward screen
three
much still discovering new menu interaction month playing
need complex
complexity equal fun
product spent lot money graphic design skimping thing would make player feel good given written still enjoy game playing friend except world get reset every six week point
game decent ca
quote half review dlcs right discus entitlement earn playing game ca developer steam combined allegation decision made suit think supporting ca forseeable future
hoping cut cancer see
rip tear blue instead green
played hour already say despite performance issue game amazing
atmosphere combat beautiful
good entry soul like game
game
feel like dark soul sequel
fromsoftware didnt really take many risk innovation aside free roam map new skill system weapon play exactly like soul like game
learned mistake game frustrating issue still present game
hitboxes entry finally good duck swing sword jump attack honestly pretty cool still issue present previous game enemy able hit wall aoe projectile hit floor etc
performance also quite inconsistent
still using really poorly designed least imo summon system
boss wish summon player there many player currently bos least want summoned bos see small handful summon sign time interacted someone else summoned player missed
happens constantly area summon sign essentially race sign
summoning friend made easier password mechanic friend see eachothers summon sign fine want friend help bos discovered yet wait get area clear get location summon
time wasting would much handier could example join steam fight bos go back game instead wasting minute time
issue iv soul game think summon mechanic really also changed game point honestly thought got rid invasion
instead changed
invaded exploring coop partner happen found used specific item allows player invade solo world even call invasion allowing
really invasion choice invaded
player least among friend group summon simple exploration fight boss seeing invaded mid bos fight essentially seen world dungeon beautifully crafted loved older game big dungeon design feel right home
game suffer however smaller opinion poorly designed
notice smaller essentially copy paste job one another different layout
even exact layout
really fun one different layout require thinking progress part dungeon quick easy similar one bos design amazing looking however still understand put margit one first boss far harder even late game horse fine
mostly used traversal
mounted combat horseback basic aside using horse help fighting game many dragon mostly using dodge firebreath attack dragon fly pretty boring fight whilst probably one best fromsoftwares game
masterpiece
""
devs improved nearly every aspect series taken risk innovation actually anything new
think fromsoftware better feel like soul game open world
fantastic game great immersion level detail
fun mission well thought
pvp great fun could map mode maybe
warhammer fan great game

lot side quest bos battle
builder fairly happy building system love easily move structure
love easy relocate base would love able set dedicated server encounter player base everywhere
ever wanted real labor love ip

actually really good
big investment ofc
every dlc three game
even sure much total though discounted
think best race added total warhammer
especially chaos addition interesting mechanic latest dlc
easily best strategy game steam far
think disappointment first felt like grade massive combination warhammer
great mod def lose modders didnt move newest warhammer
even newest mostly positive crazy rating game guess problem
feel like sold bit
largely enjoyable eventually become frustrating series endless chore get five minute get reset run treadmill get chore
got good beat game fun time especialy friend long game actualy work ruin run crashing getting stuckt desync error forcing start also really map really painful play due lightning literaly snow blindness ai sometimes completle lose questionable thing like going longer way worldmapor atillery suicide running unit prefer using ladder laying siege althoug opened gate giant hole wall next call one good game price tag really insult deliver
blatant engine problem fixed multiplayer like soul game series something lovingly hated best worst part game
cookie cutter favorite never live hype title
mash desired piece gaming history created hodgepodge pure bliss
love hate title game truly become foundation title
never accessible title soul franchise many enjoy heart conten died saying game great
let start mechanic thoroughly improved older classic
crafting
got
death
pffft would soul game monitor word died burned screen
ash war something relatively new franchise
customize favorite weapon better suit build
scale weapon fit attribute voila recipe pure chaos
expanded earlier concept turning title redacted version soul game could year ago
truly hit home many aspect engulfed flamed frenzy hour finished game
fact game accessible people would generally hate title like maybe even hated soul game decade ago playing game realizing hey game hard
wow killed bos try felt good
euphoria say least
open world really garnished new set player honest would never play soul game
enormous player base love share died well think get sadism religion destruction behest title elden honestly ball become elden died um ya
think get favorite game came absolute mess gotten much better
graphic optimization worse machine yes clearly trying push current hardware run worse previous title
mention game breaking bug minimal realm chaos campaign meh really dlc policy driven stake shogun never least one total war game installed computer
broke tradition
make room baldur gate get act together blizzard ca least wow get regular update game ever
everything wanted game best paired sigma phonk playlist maximum enjoyment
better valorant
king fps
altho full like talk
final review top
pretty awesome game far
really one hunt secret game appreciate linear path give part
definitely even though people keep trying say
maybe one bos far got double digit killing stupid tiger vanguard otherwise may try done
lose anything respawns second away run right back try
gow star war game better reference play
absolutely hate soul series elden ring dumpster fire
remotely close either would playing wukong
fun moment annoying bug like upkeep disbanded army awful boring player centered ai aggro ignoring faction war
give try mortal empire campaign redesign
excellent game someone good soul like although id say gow style game balance great
really problem chapter end bos chapter
ca wait play get
pro quality free realistic fps hp wise large community new map updatesprons mean pro con time learn swear russian based location guess case europe repetitive nostalgic like russian army unwelcoming community first start insult mom cheater common full kid suitable kid space marine sequel first space marine game
play redacted jk freaking titus like obvious enough start using equipment regular marine
hmm
ca say particularly lore accurate whatever titus cool
unfortunately mark strong time ca blame everything happened
aware
tried playing campaign mission angel death difficulty
color breakdown expected annoying as space bug swarm faster skaven warpstone rave party fairly dangerous
fact individually might seem like problem start throwing hormagaunts start stab wound mugging victim london
termagaunts little annoying freaking shooty bug appear wield regular fleshborers since damn thing flash green like miniature venom cannon
know venom cannon explain warrior swarm mechanic overwhelming sheer number really pronounced
started take engagement carefully seriously right
ca regenerate health simple execution time either need taken damage recently la bloodborne make titus feel like tissue paper unable recover easily
need use medical stims far definitely took easy critique first game much heart
titus find enemy dangerous annoying equal measure result go thinking charge jaw hell get tarpitted harder abbadon facing block guardsman backed commissar lord
fearless said guardsman unlike abbadon titus ca like attack single round combat better hope good parrying
note parrying dodging attacking less animation locked
ca cancel easily honestly make feel lot sluggish captain titus obviously best version titus
mean thin number range hopefully reducing variant less time warrior rush talk warrior
warrior big annoying as whip annoying as paired boneswords really annoying as devourer annoying as venom cannon long snout thing whip bad make sure either stay clear wiping small form dunno charge beat death get really annoying
lash combo attack hard parry better trying keep distance shooting twin boneswords tanky
devourer basically fleshborer warrior us irritating po ever encounter
constantly skate away backline pepper cluster projectile add lot damage fast
snipe soon possible
try close melee sometimes unload every shot range die last one venom cannon wielder sniper variant
venom cannon like biological railgun except instead shooting metal projectile shoot venomous acidic crystal superheated electrical discharge yes work lore launched high speed penetrate vehicle something
really work real vehicle definitely work meq shorthand equivalent like titus
get warning form sickly green laser tracking dodge shot quite easily good timing
real problem one show fighting swarm two warrior melee cousin time thing get nasty
even particular attack hard avoid either trust mobility kill first bug variant stupid tactic tired talking bug let talk melee mutually exclusive retains general fluidity first game swap two style combat fast
pistol actually useful take slot help offset disadvantage primary also serving way perform kill shot parried
holy emperor bolters
many bolter variant cross purpose actual function point make wonder need many variant
lifted primaris arsenal get whole freaking line except assault bolters
bolt carbine heavy bolt pistol auto bolt rifle name
fact would argue simply many bolters
first game role replicated unique weapon plasma gun lascannon vengeance launcher
get effective average angel death difficulty really find unique
stood weapon plasma incinerator melta plasma incinerator like cross regular plasma gun small plasma cannon performs well enough role
plasma melta rifle basically like melta gun first game
tight aoe cone damage closer center aiming circle get huge shotgun blast melt stuff like la fusil basically lascannon scaled basically charge rifle titanfall
still good weapon clearly learned lesson first game lascannon instant shot could utterly destroy unfortunate enemy face close weapon unfortunately feel little samey
chainsword effective swing tight arc relies charge attack combo stun enemy extremely awkward compared first game attack another key altogether
mean easy start chainsword combo get hit trouble way interrupting power sword little forgiving actual stance emphasize aoe single target combat
still issue able stagger big creature reliably charge attack combo matter reliable enough large sweeping attack actually outperform chainsword regular thunder hammer took big hit last game
sluggish slow despite titus better augmentation weaker
put lot hurt enemy many gap open leave unable defend properly
compare first game hammer damage reliable stun combo aoe wipe horde daemon whatever
weak power fist stagger enemy
good game gud
yes
get
play
keel bug
give u money kill warhammer
ultimate male fantasy
war thank miyazaki masterpiece monkey oo oo ah ah played couple mission friend loving like love licking eugene mom arsecrack long shift chippy
""
kill varre spit hard fact
chase maiden go gym level strength invest fashion soul get fresh drip match drippy weapon maiden chase
good game sir
real issue tyranids ca compete space marine orks single player almost feel like afterthought look multiplayer stuff like class perk system better weapon selection armor customization
certain section playing highest difficulty solo campaign felt definitely designed around multiple player ai cutting get creative surviving
gigantic issue sure playing highest difficulty helping want mention story interesting could
space marine ending could much interesting followup
instead interesting short story put white dwarf kind get titus space marine starting point boltgun created cover half story stuff needed put game generally improvement
كسم الصينين feel cheated going back
would recommend buy mortal empire release
honestly game half made little amount faction
release date game mean game complete ready play fully
took full price upfront gave lesss half game upfront
realise guy
wanted release dlcs happens half product made available release date play less half game right waiting mortal empire yes campaign boring
going back
fun small map currently available
shame ca
taken half price u half game
release mortal empire dlc would way better
instead advice point wait immortal empire release see worth fun unit lord faction graphic would expect campaign fails many level
actual campaign mechanic feel rewarding oftentimes punishing progress
realm chaos torturous bore really offer reward particularly tzeentch realm crap shoot racing enemy ai hoping randomly choose correct portal path
random warp portal
monumentally frustrating limited army often lead position hoping lucked appropriate force right position ai go kind jankiness
expect waste army several dedicated sitting important territory
particularly necessary ai decides build stack bumrushing city battle
ai interact well city offense defense
unit defending point attacking wandering unit back forth random point
ai general bad
easily abuseable difficulty battle map many time abuse ai cheat stats higher difficulty make trying play basic tactic moot
""
infantry really anything unit supposedly counter
melee infantry basically useless face ranged unit
regular cavalry unit generally good
basically strat tends wind hide army exposing single fast moving unit usually lord break ai luring unit time pound dust via mass range
khorne leeway free army spam disposable melee yeah ultimately good time campaign ai bad cheat compete player
also bias hilarious watching ai ignore full stack another ai war come barreling player way undefended minor settlement get utterly ransacked mean anything ai playing constraint player deal campaign map beyond movement
game year decadeit dark soul soul touching gameit masterpiece total war warhammer iii another great installment series
honestly ca wait myriad update promised large map
one game series every dlc bought feel worthwhile time love base game already give
internet ruined game fixed server locational requirement playing server yet inland chinese ppl keep messing server including racist chat calling ppl commit even rmt regulation
block ip ppl stop ruining game server
monkeh dlc massively overpriced game becomes extremely unstable multiplayer campaign
maiden gore glory
ask
killing tyranids never looked felt better
serve emperor
pretty good perfect fair
great design voice acting
got normal ending game cinematic masterpiece goty suremonke reviewed completion ongoing review true successor dark soul franchise gem pick predesesors left managed add actual value already perfect recipe
open world game massive much less linear previous soul game pro con mixed together jump added
feel handcrafterd improved multiplayer support excellent well pvp sublime hint story throughout flow game previous soul
finally beta prepare die edition suffer alien mutant death duty alone terra kept grim darkness millennium shall
achievement dare
一百昏 pro new flushed multiplayer campaign feature warhammercon lot bug expected squashed rate singleplayer campaign fun chore much worse tw run terribly lot people blame denuvo previous released month tomorrow half many patch fix content previous worth atm
sure like tw game time good game also cost arm leg dlc
know going unpopular side want anyone thinking buying game get chance see review tell like never played game without passion connection universe judge game provides
game horrible certainly great campaign short
short today standard
like hour short
finished one sitting work
horrible since campaign arguably best part game short really bode well
fun combat great visuals entertaining story done end day
multiplayer well great
operation interesting best monotonous worst
essentially get play mission campaign would always order go stuff
provides interesting new perspective certainly nothing great
endless war multiplayer pvp fun well day
afterwards realize game mode map
get repetitive instantly
know gon na say oh update look roadmap
brother paying least hour campaign lackluster multiplayer get tired two day
honestly love slight performance issue starting game cut scene bt overall game experience make
good challenging bos fight without fear loosing stuff love fantasy game si must
updated
know game system completely chance encounter potential bad especially low end pc could handle global sticking valorant
initially hesitant game seemed risky make many fundamental change formula barely changed source condition zero
however seeing much valve listened continues listen community quickly make change short long term completely restored faith game
global offensive incredibly fun plenty casual competitive player
top also plenty way promote support esports fundamental step reinvigorating competitive gaming scene
however important thing game community incredibly nice friendly game difficult intense extremely welcoming
good stuff
game much better state hope get see snakemen nippon ind game conclusion
difficulty bit high good
art excellent gameplay creative
vastly different traditional game strong eastern flavor
really wanted love game seems like ca forgot everything fan loved warhammer ii support went corporate greed instead
free lord higher price every dlc bug everywhere underwhelming immortal empire constant balance problem
sad see could one greatest trilogy video gaming become testament everything wrong gaming industry
love game
worst ai ever played
would like
gray knight apothecary librarian overprice garbage dlc super fun great gripe story short liking
siege battle siege full choke point little open space
unit scale wall equippable unit drag ladder wall
battle generally simple total war title
feel like took challenge game order make appeal wider audience
graphic best aspect opinion game look gorgeous
map immortal empire patch get entire world feel game could tell story bit three kingdom reach certain goal get idea feel event around
hero sometimes hero get bit jarring
wish record mode type option like hero rather would bee challenging certain situation general retinue
daemon prince example kinda weak tends useless
balthasar gelt almost alone defeat army magic artillery spell
another solution would rebalanced size also find unit size different unit quite small important since game supposed fantasy epic tiny battle
well fixing mod
mod workshop increase unit size however ai tends get stuck gate exhibit odd often devastating behavior
three kingdom use similar mod massive battle full stack army almost reaching warrior
ai three kingdom exhibit personally find ai bit lackluster compared title though catastrophic throne britannia
bad cutting experienced player like
also tend increasing difficulty legendary due ai getting modifier boost thus prefer use ai mod make ai smarter instead
found hecleas ai mod work well
diplomacy find diplomatic option interact faction bit limited
currently sway someone giving money example trade ancillaries like three kingdom
sometimes might short getting trade agreement enough money finish deal sitting pile ancillaries could away work great personally used proton played good total war game view great one
game look gorgeous pure fantasy setting also interesting
really love fantasy stuff like lord ring etc
might find full price justified fantasy cool absolute favorite thing would personally recommend waiting sale get
art visuals music astonishing well end gameplay took everything nice first game threw window replaced botched attempt copying dark aim sight mode get stuck get melee death due unresponsive ca cancel animation back stepping like first game allowed stuck watching new health bar melt away volley chaos terminator teleported shooting thunder hammer animation see enemy hit bang face even flinch keep shooting bolter face like barely inconvenience honestly buy play skip atrocious gameplay watch fan boy play yt see game mark word worth forgot mention multiplayer latency never quarter second end good internet multiplayer server probably found dumpster fire
waited get given rocky launch still regret
certainly pay full price
game incomplete feel like sketch lot work
loved taken lot fun game made feel like grind slog
new faction feel like missing unit rushed development
potential good game one day idea worth supporting good
amazing game
finally great see fully finished game release
happy released ea like many game
def made game experience top notch
graphic story par top game year
playing series little year
wish got recognition company deserves
treat product better ca
addicted
help leg gone brother open world soulsborne game nuff said
tomb king mortal empire campaign whii bought warhammer iii started campaign compare
difference instantly noticeable especially term diplomacy system
improvement significant going back whii felt like step backward
diplomacy whiii actually make sense outpost make complete sense context game whether building getting ally
add extra layer strategy quality life improvement also great
thing like easier system made gameplay smoother
however still auto feature shame
hey middenheim built day right game world also significantly larger time around massive plus
much explore conquer adding depth longevity said campaign map leaf much desired term performance
big deal people make certainly highlight game
map struggle maintain fps battle different story altogether
battle run crisp fps making clash visually stunning far one crash battle one stopped happening disabled ai alliance grand scheme thing warhammer iii huge step forward franchise
despite flaw game wholeheartedly recommend would finally recommend game get newbie series
wait discount since price steep offer ton content
looking forward future update improvement edit turn feature top left corner character
elden ring experienced entirety beautiful art ever seen almost two year passed none major bug fixed
plus recent cash grab soc dlc probably passing new content game
third final game series allowed warhammer become cool brief year probably good modders people done creative assembly job new buggy hell minor settlement battle new faction play differently although seem much stronger style changed cell shaded style
feel little playing faction death match different art style
campaign come idea though main menu would place mobile game
fire ux team wtf game run like cyberpunk
ti cpu rarely hit fps stutter campaign map skip frame
legit struggling play game right
unit roster laughable faction like troop
think even unique unit across faction bare mind added new unit year make humanoid use exact skeleton animation run idea
play old faction even custom game multiplayer literately limited new faction right
even though campaign menu select unit spell browser actually select faction game reverts back workshop support
""
modder literally carry title creative assembly ironically super bare bone lacking like tipple aaa game day
tutorial prologue crash time ended skipping enjoy array new bug
losing battle even though troop still alive
losing battle troop become stuck new minor settlement
losing battle destroyed ai wall instantly full hp splitting army half way less content release previous title
nice monki forever really want enjoy game
fun following titus story great gameplay jive
also first warhammer game ever oh man bloody bug glitch
game refusing start time freezing crashing mid game sudden heavy drop frame screw entire experience even get past second mission swamp suddenly drop frame freeze crashand pc meet game requirement yeah saber focus
please fix
pee pee poo poo goo goo ga ga fun car go brrrrrr reject modernityreturn monke game teething issue sure game size going
first patch smoothed lot corner roadmap demonstrated long haul improvement content drop thing go
term improvement game mostly shown improvement thing stayed less couple decline overall good
map design improved campaign map one largest interesting series unit variance nice distinct faction race diplomacy better battle better magic better generally content launch either two predecessor game
main campaign iffy term goal get ultimately play fine
lot potential better hard say far develop idea
roc lot better potential enjoyable vortex campaign game
roc campaign get hugely expanded still mostly fine sure get idea together
combined map ultimately good like game able go keep fresh
one best improvement game campaign aspect
finally player campaign glorious fun
campaign vastly improved way turn work alliance etc
far nuanced interesting
playing often improves average campaign realm chaos main campaign almost feel like designed mind make race soul interesting faction work cover others race
race usually within turn giant map conquer big deal really lot fun
seen people disappointed long going take combined map game come anyone basic grasp reality see monumental sized project course going take time thing happen
kinda physic play really two game thing come game get better
end cycle amazing game likely different
overall recommend game looking forward coming later year
maiden battle improved race campaign terrible elite army good province capital basically need win
elder ring development day really slow thats biggest issue biggest issue dlc policy ridiculous paar paradox selling minor content sometimes essential faction base game price worst thing whale allow behaviour happen saying thing like ehm poor something
im poor stupid enough pay barebones dlc youre manchild life parent dont really worry money much car house pay maybe even family child definitelly wo pay kind money mere dlc
day havent bought chaos dwarf shadow change still wo less encourage everyone
positive review included game release added late september
game taught anything dream blunt rotation balthasar gelt
game decently fun wait play run better

happens roc ie
word restart long people play campaign happen almost every time
play one friend ok error wo sometimes tedious
factionwide unit suffer sort alzheimers forget order battle
sometimes stop midway sometimes wo even react first place
case molest mouse rapid click start frantically checking whole map unit command reached brain got lost track start sending command
rince repeat develope sort paranoia
damn foul chaos god bad changed minor settlement fight every battle siege wall climb gate destroy point take time consuming
still joke even good experienced army enjoy fight manually
imagine playing past round still expanding faction
battle settlement therefor siege battle
optimization game could better
tweak release ie frame drop long loading screen common current price tag damn high game still beta probably next year recommend current state
get first total war warhammer let one

heard software releasing new part even open world
first bit skeptical know software would deal new idea could say
exceeded graphic truly stunning
everything designed detail
world still fully explored well np enemy boss much
want say ca see graph difference low maximum
point view mainly play low everything run mechanicsi played soul like part pc
however say implemented well
besides love game soul like part reason
separate jump button
part quite annoying sometimes hectic press several button negativefrom point view nothing negative anymore
previously negative came frequent game crash
nothing negative anymore
price elden ring justice game everything
software really surpassed going play elden ring long time fully explored big world yet
goal reach maximum stats
also hope dlc expansion point
addition would like see achievement ratinggraphic mechanic gameelden ring opinion good game get get lot support incantation ghost

return monke absolutely outstanding stunning scenery one best game ive ever played cant wait next instalment captivated sens learn game dead five easy
becomes free
people owned became free play basically get nothing
battle
hacker smurfs galore thought bad game dollar guess
battle
royale
weird mixture various game unique idea thrown
problem feel really slapped together
character overly responsive feel like weighs ton moving around
general combat okay though nothing amazing solid foundation build building terrible bad
basic building uncomfortable finicky
least free move building camera help snapping troublesome intuitive
get exact right angle something like roof panel cumbersome took three time long get roof head decent variety thing build got pretty free range build see fit
however build radius least progression small felt limited
placing thing work well enough easy enough rotate thing around decent tech tree work gathering less painless would expect
hack tree get wood go find copper whatever else mine
nothing felt like took long amass spend minute
like crafting queue feature crafting station free go whatever wait thing nothing took long skill system bit confusing
whole guessing like pokemon type system
obtain new little critter deviant guess call put backpack skill use
found time butterfly little jelly guy
butterfly extra dp would toss something jelly guy could turn cover act defense
honestly forgot time
got around level fought one thing put sort resistance
first rift bos big thing basic mechanic able match make hard anything bare minimum mechanic fell overevery enemy came across threat like
general zombie like guy see everywhere dead even know
couple weird big cat thing tarp head
also die easily need back pedal fight ca hit
ai level game
although genuinely think game better enemy ai gamecouple larger creature could even tell fell dead nothing basic pistol get shortly tutorial
enemy seem different attack spam random bothered could see everyone structure everywhere ca go anywhere without seeing someone little base forward respawn point
urban sprawl active server stuff built everywhere goofy see
mean get going happen game build public server obscene
anyone played something like old school starwars galaxy know im talking house house far eye see concentrated around major area
feel bad sorta take whole thing
point finding cool place build even unique base design stuff everywhere everyone place look less
im sure get better later area pretty big turn pretty good
real complaint
game look ran great
best visually genre good contender good visuals
real visual glitch anything weird happening
solid might give another go later think saw everything needed see
grab free game
seems okay much competition trying better
since free id say pick curious expect something gon na draw make want keep going
lost stream really quickly real shame alot potential ala
""
right discus privilege entitlement earn playing game
assembly point wish option recommend dislike
game good dev proved repeatedly care player
care dev treat recommend game however expect listened dev accept constructive feedback would recommend
product received free best fps game ever game overshadowed expectation strategy expensive yes
want dlcs
would also say worth less
never got play warhammer bad pc even excited skip part see everything immortal like graphic play ultra amazing detailed strategy game choice unit big already forget unit diplomatic system everything need complex crusader king need game focused find build upgrade system complex like skill system run smoothly bug game get supported devs watch community feedback rarely like much complaining high level dlc price bit high euro make story mean give story mode much lore cool like amazing trailer total war make
would love make future campain effort wish future alot dlcs
warhammer iv immortal empire ii kislev waited year game worth wait
finally warhammer game suck hope future make content game sh understand potential universe
buy unless interested series deal lot game breaking bug generally poor qa
treat like early access game might ready full release towards end year immortal empire completed
even confident enough describe future copium release immortal empire staple game content anything beta
good tactical game
need lot pratice master one go chaos dwarf fan
keep climbing mountain
keep smiling
best first person shooter game available much active game updating every month
good official server
better graphic new gun update cs game similar cs opinion great thing nominated game
overall great game
overall fine total war game good warhammer
reason get play immortal empire requires warhammer play immortal empire owning game pretty good deal
game also super fun
pvp campaign joy play
action feel deliberate almost controlling angel ton metal suit
love sad say wonderfully refreshing able boot game play hour two close
rather boot daily check weekly check season pas boot game play
try open wallet something praised year refreshing see
fun game really good opinion despite lot issue could reviewpraise review enjoyment ahead dying pvp people connected ecuadorean hut abuse bug certified good time
combat mechanic extremely clunky misleading trash mob far much health back execute understand completed game hardest difficulty first two day would balance map size new york waste time money far cry expected dollar game paid wanted play early
update september focused game mechanic instead get sparring area private lobby absolute waste money unless want play easy difficulty avoid game feel like free beta game full serious update playable anything lowest difficulty orginal review game enormous potential let play lot completely different faction unique playstyles unfortunately simply many issue able recommend
launched pretty sorry state really gotten better since
lot bug still present since launch
ai pose challenge whatsoever since waste lot time running around outside attack range love sack raze weakest settlement rather going city actually matter
unit battle tend circle forever instead attacking list go
game dire need improvement bugfixes getting right absurdly overpriced dlc alongside lackluster free patch seems break least many thing ai issue persist though game get harder thanks ai getting huge bonus lieu actually taught play game begun getting regular free fix new feature point comfortable saying great experience chance going get even better
installed c gohad lot fun gave headshot one matchnext match got headshot missed every shotuninstalled c gotold friend would never ever play againfew minute laterinstalled c go relationship since c beta would install uninstalled enjoy game enjoy total war game campaign frustrating faction seem fleshed
also seems lot bug unit glitch stop attacking overall pace battle seems sure improve time want buy game maybe wait bit fix
dlcs overpriced as skip
get first game dlcs like cheap game enjoy
listen might get flak title
campaign mission post campaign pve mission
could knock couple day maybe afternoon really good friend much care pvp map mode total content aside going dripfeed several season really consider acceptable price point unless really like combat system personally particularly love
could like less issue barebones amount content
saying could improve season want buy time writing think risk disappointed like
rrraaargh
given thee courtesy enough
fight pure str
warrior
young first got know back early day holiday even got play game first time
year later friend area playing c thats joined steam january
formed team trained two year climbed ladder local due insufficient capacity private life member lack morale split seen state condition zero source even hand old mod called c promod people tried get gameplay graphic source
something really long break decided reroll c go check game evolved
took played matchmaking good mm wanted set foot
c go perfect balance gameplay graphic source source definitely luckily
efficient c player ive talked graphic dont matter explains many pro play low resolution stuff like reminds good ol day read still harsh sometimes frustrating worth effort truly stick learn time play try learn mistake better get
since year tried almost game title fps genre nothing could ever stand simplicity competitiveness
looking great first need create join every man count every round count big community involved tournament stuff game looking realistic shooter compare gun like real life bulletdrop thing like game definitely hope shared thought game helpful gave bit insight whether want join community
best regardsknight ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh start game thinking good session greeted привет
know wrong block town
try thing positively get worse
check enemy team see pro csgo rip wannabe polish may add get pit despair lie game like every hype give best
hard work start pay think going bad kqly appears nowhere stomp remorse
uninstall
month later get drunk think good idea download csgo cycle begin
game decade
hand game make feel like man played since launch day min check ran better new gpu
still significantly worse performance play least immortal empire maybe
fact lukewarm reception vortex campaign indication seek emulate mortal empire experience double vortex type game requires mod good gameplay experience deserve positive review
appreciate modding community quick make many good change change fact modding community creativity rather fixing blatant issue game ironically tutorial campaign one best tutorial ever seen game
need teach play ever tw tutorial anyway definitely best one
tutorial campaign thing compensate lacking main newcomer total warhammer likely completely fine
played many many hour fall flat well short
based seen far game kept development least another year
poor showing
visually stunning lore draw intensely
incredible experience enemy keep toe
enjoyed sekiro shadow die twice also enjoy quite familiar also brings something new genre
pretty straightforward achievement hunter
hope grab game enjoy much giant tumor inside rectum really enjoyed aspect game
graphic scenery music va gameplay much
highly recommend others
scorpion king bos hit like truck flaw fair share bug
ca downer looking good new dlc throne decay
overall fun mod friendly much replay ability
thing need fixed ai siege battle
dlc overwhelming expensive first time player also plenty freelc try
id recommend trying race see like consider buying dlc race
favorite valuable dlc opinion anything lizardmen forge chaos dwarf beastmen prophet warlock
good dlc find offer
overall game could better potential love even flaw
really take advantage mod learn game basically free dlc quality life ca added
best survival game ever
better undawn
well well well
consequence action
valve understanding game
lazy devs totally worth year wait
blaidd beloved peak company well
cancelled roughly mil shooter tw pharaoh dead arrival passing cost charging dlc less content
buy game seems like wo genuine quality support future
buy tw warhammer game buy warhammer instead one
better quality one massive downgrade across board
game time
""
one best game history
game proof project need battle pass paid cosmetic shop successful
probably one passionate game released past decade creativity attention detail absolutely one top selling point graphic
graphic absolutely absurd unreal engine engine market game make good use
yes using mean game sometimes high optimization problem although minor compared title released combat enemy variety game simply absurd
elden ring amazing game even game caliber still struggle keep game
every single enemy game unique original highly detailed model movesets small amount reused asset among enemy boss
bos fight creative enough make jaw drop
game lot different skill movesets transformation item make combat feel unique encounter
although got ta admit wish biggest problem game compared action game definitely limitation exploration map
game absurd amount invisible wall limitation terrain blocking exploration sometimes even clear path look like explorable otherwise
reason giving game soundtrack fit well theme game osts magical epic
chapter animation end different art style music different story meaning
person used main theme portrayed game magical experience sure would definitely recommend game anyone interested chinese folklore mythology
story amazing totally unfamiliar anything related theme playing got ta say really want know general theme meaning behind genuinely believe game remembered throughout year one passionate successful project gaming history
ultimate fps shooter
fps fan game
high skill fast paced round intense gun battle
one people steam game highly suggest add collection
game enough ensure idiot get ego driven power trip get people muted renamed banned etc
namely server pve
game refreshing
many feature opportunity fun combat
need work already good place
often find asking wonder limit always damn yea way let
really feel like good sandbox play
hitting right note
wipe wipe wipesno noat current state pay money less would waagh
much fun pant sitting
valhalla attack dragon wererats sentient pot people trusty steed backstab every single one demigod become one true king beneath yggdrasil
great warhammer game complete experience figure painted parade ready neckbeards complaining time
going depth people articulated grievance fluently could express garbage
wish option play without chaos realm similar could pick omit chaos invasion first second game
somehow campaign siege worse earlier entry
would pick eye storm saying improvement advertised net negative compared game somehow old bug even worse
strategy really mean much unit hardly respond look great lot visual presentation taken hit
get wanting add color game lot model look cartoony especially tree many people already pointed
think second game hit nice balance third entry seems gone bit patience never tested playing game totalwar game
monke gotyi monke monke monkereject humanity embrace monkemonke see monke monke kill said perfect game exist
elden ring elden ring
already know good like dark soul game sad tale two half
first half absolutely brilliant open world experience encourages lot exploration
really took back good old day playing video game sense wonder curiosity
second half game however really bad thing new soul game
unbalanced unfun stacking le epic bos bos making difficult sake difficult
gone memorable boss true king allant gwyn replaced boss spectacle sake fanbase
still great game though way better drivel open world game score update suggestion big update overwatch reviewer send one gotv demo manually system every hour long ban rate high still
would crush overwatch sas show skin anymore make objective waiting time anymore overwatch overwatch done demo system main menu streamed video
would remove loading time waiting time would easier skip back fourth personal need see situation statement valve skipping case til end allowed sure case data necessary remove major cheating part put together one cheating
general enough would increase ban rate lot since investigator review whole case find used bhop script anti aim external assistance separation unranked prime non prime prime player currently want play unranked amount cheater overwatch non prime match current case overwatch fresh made throw away acc playing non prime
reason ban
create new acc removing rank dangerzone adding overwatch dangerzone prevent cheating whoever verifies profile personal id get
verifying multiple account possible rank avoid smurfs
also one acc get banned current future acc person id get autobanned
esl succesful since source http matchmaking season every month new season start
player receive coin season highest reached rank received season
rank reset entirely new season drop like silver player drop silver gold nova player drop gold nova player drop player drop nerf deagle base damage hit kill body possible anymore
time decrease damage dropoff damage high remove spread sniper weapon inaccuracy scoping fix ob issue
valve destroyed usual streaming ca deal possible valve work together youtube twitch streamingplatform manually ban cheater individual buy menu people able manually set buy menu need including set thing want buy
people example buy ever
many buy sort stuff time
monke original goku instead monkey take anger god game time
game basically another copy nioh
nioh great good thing
ok game free instantly see many hacker around obviously hacking making fun u
hardly met hacker week almost every match someone hacking
please fix
u still think game good u hold l monmnke game look fantastic campagne fun
difficulty gap pve big
difficulty stupid
enemy one category higher fighting green equipment meaning every enemy feel like one category higher tyranid warrior take amount damage leaper way get better weapon play win harder difficulty
premade die way anything else like play helldivers worst
game provides epic melee stuff whole meta difficulty ever go melee mighty space marine rolling like potatopes ground folowed vawes vawes enemy imune light melee attack sm burning shooting bolters jack sh char except bulwark useless better char melta one kill special relience change game horde shooter frustrating unfair rolly polly interest pvp ca judge fun behind hard wall stupid decission sad ca get money back
alright guesscould use sex mod peace

game science absolutely cooked first game ton argue could lot different thing work still amazing first game especially transition making mobile game
first game know even better quality could come dlc another game
game truly foreign studio fact also gave sbi finger another reason love game
one best week life grinding hell game
something forget celebrate game science deserve
hit
actual game alright first despite backlash awful game
much rather play release tww original said good game either
ca pulled classic razzle dazzle releasing game unfinished patching backlash stop
every update game improved overall even bug kept multiplying
without doubt biggest improvement least far implementation mod support allowed community fill negative space design improve balancing overall
may change soon though immortal empire patch loom horizon
would recommend people buy game ie drop
""
mean worth playing cause like playing implementation ie bring breadth content game doubt shake review however excited scared turn doubt ie playing hundred hour regardless quality ca yet make comment well implemented much love shown future release
strongly believe game gotten dlc support good game perhaps even great one however shall leave review negative let honest
game needed another year dev time released content tho necessarily ie way polish
honestly one best example free play game
great survival element blast playing
rarely play game lose track time
would heavily compare game far cry series term secure outpost case rift
destroyed peace
full cheater keep getting teammate coordination sloth
never played rts game still easy mode still lot fun game mortal empire rescue
yes bug bug everywhere
also markup lord pack
game full cheater valve still anything despite fact earn almost billion dollar every year game community
anti cheat must worst one ever created used game developer
forced update product received free wukong game finally say monkey proud
knew swinging staff could satisfying
fun friend maybe wait sale good graphic smooth af game play engaging bossesconsboss rush simulator low world exploration visual camera bug linear awesome game
spent hour far
recomended update make game
make proper anti cheat system
vac joke considering mostly competetive game
ranking system updated
really shi wise game really enjoyable newplayers get disheartened considereding large chunk player playing year way day skilled
playing game requires atleast skill even silver league
reccomend player practises several casual match jumping competeve game
reccomend playing practise match setting local area server playing offline first understand basic
product received free monke campaign great mp incredible
operation broken right crash time hope fix want start playing
chapter already feel like recommend vague definition action game almost bos rush cool exploration regular enemy encounter bos
honestly love idea fighting many fight beautifully designed enemy different far found reskinned bos combat system solid game many combo mind requires use dodge skill right timing focus building meter stronger heavy attack also help stagger enemy
imo simple effective find lot satisfaction stronger foe series heavy attack thing complain though navigating world game map lot area visually stunning look different remember something like locked door left behind
enormous amount invisible wall also make hard tell since game ton secret hard find without guide make finding even harder somewhat frustrating
rate game russian
excellent game take feature soul like game time thing
feel bit nostalgic action adventure game used past
year looking great great game without woke nonsenseapes together strong
best year game anticheat bad embarassing game size
furthermore valve proven last year care community continue buy skin
bad change kept game wish playerbase ignored without explanation regardless feedback
removing bot someone leaf game something overwhelming toxic behavior player etc beautiful version csgo worse anticheat badly programmed horrendous mappool worse fps noone even cared aesthetic game begin
nice job valve gain money skin making game worse every aspect
blue casual find kid spamming dank meme music russian guy yelling kid year old asking skinsrussian guy yelling year oldrussian guy clutch last round dy bomb russian guy yell still knife fu k leaf would casual product received free amazing game year goat
good update review
give thumb
great game really
ruined insane loading time gig speed forced play others
disconnect internet play bot doesnt save progress even though get steam accomplishment offline
make zero sense
skin
cool simply different color exact armor
like devs think space marine clone something
meant unique cookie cutter
plague gaming folk forced online play single player game death pc gaming
along non stop need account account play game getting plain ridiculous
fan pick purely campaign epic amazing
rest game complete letdown
know ami know ami know amall know must kill
would recommend game player definitely especially warhammer fan
must recommend game cultist really find much slaanesh game go back play concord dustborn
oh wait basic gameplayyou play either terrorist deployed battlefield round giving small allowance purchase weapon make extra money winning round could also hold knife enemy demanding money although would risky since enemy would likely shoot terrorist team goal plant explosive near uhhm important box plant wait patiently must eliminate terrorist force defuse bomb thus protecting ever important box certain honourable opponent terrorist sure set bomb timer long enough give ct chance slaughter remaining defuse list attribute game attribute matchmaking teach child harsh reality gambling although never seem learn even later rank cool looking fast growing population player fat stack loot dropped somewhat high replay deathmatch game type could go detail negative part would make review long boring negative attribute although love single player campaign could use work
really wish longer final bos fight pretty lame
last around second time way lose taking offense old man constantly insult year old could beat blindfolded
game mode infernal played map people like game mode however personally dislike yet chance experience explain seems like normal map however real goal scurry around finding shred scrap rego normally hidden obscurer unused section map ability around different location even leave game entirely minute demolition also known jokemode added purely joke volvo supposed unlock every april fool day however hacker probably guy permanently unlocked
volvo working fix ever since demolition game mode automatically give everyone amour requires get kill weapon extremely poor damage armoured opponent

remember never gamble opening case
made method
think time quit day whole love game would recommend anyone good half good half
game okay
everything else chosen
thousand hour total war game continual disrespect absurd
faithfully paid full price game consistently fixed modders
attila mod beat anything yall could ever pay make actually care
free ask dlc including dumb blood gore mod ya always rip u

shameful accomplished money bag ball ck company
guy making rome ii knew attila guy
stuck troy model pharaoh whole game dlc
hate guy become supporting anymore
want recommend game
enjoyed lot fun moment
stupid problem game considering direct successor design choice still bug game well year release
ranged unit hard time firing target correctly
army get stuck agent frozen indefinitely
random crash happen battle map
several unit description even match actually ai brain dead siege
think main settlement siege worst total war game since empire
defender actually worse attacker new capture point system
defense work well
wall still worthless
ai ca defend settlement
epic fail make siege pain end
hate older race empire dwarf dark elf especially feel bland immortal empire
empire mechanic terrible
cathay finished race
bretonnia need attention
realm chaos bad campaign pure simple
good
id welcome argument contrary well executed original character release insulting released game unfinished
immortal empire yet
cathay finished still feel finished
new chaos dwarf feel much fleshed half assing lot content
infuriating see
capable much better job recommend product good faith keep putting game dlcs update snuff
unfinished unpolished untested
expect u accept test wait month proper change
point moved next paid title released take money
global offensive point click simulation game play travel agent sends people paradise
would recommend warhammer current state
best game
extremely fun
actually feel like space marine
see eventually getting repetitive far blast hour
game beautiful game thousand hour old account litteraly put life xdthis game still love even cheating rate increased drasticly even year playing csgo change map etc game came right back hearth unemployed middle age boomer russian speaking kid war criminal lifer together one game
perfect balkan tho poor dont recommend due game causing anger issue might brake monitor smth
final installment everything
overpriced dlcs content cut base gamegreedy sega fully deserves treatment negative review school headphone headphone come unplugged whole class panic hail gunfire heard followed message bomb planted suspended week totally worth iti rate scale fallen leaf tell storyof tarnished became elden home across screen land seed look back upon u age elden ring 떨어진 잎사귀가 말한다 그 치세는 엘든 링의 시대라고 불릴 것이다
great game good job game science posted februaryremove denuvo player legaly obtained game least performance got illegally
ist disgrace ever buying long denuvo stay thmubs stay review helpful
yes funny people found review people found review funny kehoe product reviewsnot hr record hr review time posted februarybait switch hid terrible drm would performance including drm review copy
reviewer since booted launch version game find hit fps hardware setting
performance even worse windowed mode full screen mode result frequent crash ever fun game currently crippled boneheaded software punishes paying review helpful
yes funny people found review people found review funny product reviewsnot hr record hr review time posted februaryuntil ca fix performance issue supposedly caused denuvo would recommend game
gamble whether fine performance worse normal even lowest setting
seems like copy gave content creator denuvo thus performance issue added upon launch nobody would able take account review
absolutely abhorrent thing
something tell move sega part either way tolerated
point say keep money wait launch ca decide whether buy review helpful
yes funny people found review people found review funny product reviewsnot hr record hr review time posted februaryi really want recommend game
feel like recommend game
functionally broken release
ca encourage people alpha test game ca cost money
ram vram rtx
game barely run
mind boggling huge advancement ca made optimizing
honestly still plenty mileage get second game playing fix one
positive year game incredible excellent dlcs certainly buy great mortal empire mode
optimized ui fixed importantly fix insane unit control issue recommend unit control completely broken
sure playtested build
unit stop moving stand still ignore order
get melee unit engage ranged unit thats running literally sit click entire time obviously unit army
issue would tolerable
deal crashing framerate drop ca handle game actually unplayable broken
level doomstack skarbrand dy single unit archer afk legit second got charge unit fell asleep basically ruin entire game
every single one unit exacerbated half faction represented main campaign ranged focused dr play right
wait game actually finish development cycle masterpiece similar went year
game amazing fence least know get game buck later u finished alpha testing review helpful
yes funny people found review people found review funny product hr record hr review time posted februaryas total war warhammer iii exactly stand compared total war warhammer ii due lack content owing current infancy lack expansive addons update seen warhammer ii
likely would case shipped mortal empire day one elect release without add least placeholder version chaos dwarf instead using orks game run somewhat poorly well optimized however mitigated running decreased resolution lowered texture
however entirely temporary factor interest interest immediately
unless huge fan kislev cathay chaos ogre kingdom would highly suggest delaying purchase future content time likely better spent warhammer ii still access content warhammer said chaos extremely well designed faction gameplay standpoint unique mechanic stand anything else creative assembly ever made
tried first several turn faction safely unfortunately say legion chaos far favorite unfortunate mostly looking forward ogre campaign sandboxy vortex new mechanic involving invasion realm chaos slay daemon prince opposed completing ritual warhammer ii
personally enjoy minor settlement siege battle
adverse change people
supply system bizarre best convinced entirely detrimental gameplay playing round however would appreciate setting able disable mechanic return old design
enjoy design map though really like new survival mode custom current state would suggest waiting update unless fan total war fantasy race warhammer iii barring course chaos run old cpu ram gtx extremely obsolete setup game
however twiddling setting im able run game tolerable
possible gain almost low setting blurriness strain give right
might enjoy conditionally would recommend review helpful
yes funny people found review people found review funny product hr record hr review time posted intel rtx long review
tl dr end

ryzen issue running game kill god ca break hinge door
total war banhammer war wallethammer true
buy game ca pretty solid game incredible art direction overall bos refreshing see woke monkey man stick
nice game recommend somewhat troubled history war community
ca recommend currently way company handling player base
amazing bought early assumption would continue listen player base work game via regular patch regular dlc true feel like odd direction change leadership given clearly positive image good presumably dlc sale volume saw
game amazing
would recommend play
together three warhammer game played atleast give try
thing like take alot space thats worth every single dollar
ui negative
everything else direct improvement past game
heavily improved upon already fantastic experience
game reminds certain thing every time boot get ear cleaned sound cue constant screeching yelling team consider religion thing hear time even believe came person getting eye checked play made team mate thinking downloaded game first placemy final verdict
would recommend want sanity challenged
product received free playing game roughly hour come point express opinion game current global offensive highly competitive game focus team wo
really
really think im going describe game perfect cut gem title
well came wrong review comrade essence c go current state thing really would want game type obviously cheating long time valve care
thing useful milk game money bone dry deserted
ca get fact valve actually noticed flaw instead keep releasing useless item bug fixing update game really common nowadays back day every competitive match went would atleast griefer anything insult generally discriminate absolutely nothing help team win single round
individual commonly found lower rank seen smurfs c go matchmaking actual cartoon ruin game new player giving appearance c go worth playing know saltening begin want experience highly concentrated amount salt one match salt mine followed community year old cancerous radiation level chernobyl
well friend c go game
warranty broken mouse keyboard screen headset desk window possibly hand hitting desk hard included
mean server intend talk instead time get matched people side damn galaxy
good want learn everyone sexual intercourse family diverse language simultaneously proceed lose match
tl dr c go game give everybody different experience unless playing russia always b rushed every round
cringy joke aside think game somewhat addicting pleasant long run despite initial steep learning curve
valve ever decides actually update system happy play game james
every time think relatively done game find mile area explore new enemy defeat
expansive open world game ever played
passing hour c teach competitive skill aiming mechanic transfer across fps game even genresthere game completely change way approach different titlescs one themdump time ignore plebsyou wo regret flavour original better graphic
would like
small man big enemy
played c go long time hour game
c well put together never issue performance cant recall time experienced game breaking glitch
playing friend competitively fun
making way rank big challenge finally accomplish goal satisfying
conclusion get boy together play outa game might find new favorite
battle dinasour riding lizard use solar laser fighting satanic babylonain dwarf enslave demon
game ever think maybe life really really ridiculously good looking like playing human really really good looking character since baby good game tried play arm race still ran foot
preface really like game
however support recommend based business newcomer buyer beware need old game dlc order unlock lot content see dlc list cart
time writing bit cad including last two dlc added oh want blood need add another dlc base game also note looking purchase receipt dlc warhammer increased paid back also gouging
reduce dlc old game scummy increase price next like shadow loose change fun game started playing yes perfect fun
little difficult first play becomes easier navigate
like fact whole tutorial every server join
make sure friend join one avoid redoing tutorial
overall far
really enjoying tbh
ca behavior aside game become real slog
ca really explain theory wanted faction map somehow
elden ring without doubt one best game ever released among gaming hall fame past decade among like skyrim witcher red dead redemption god war breath best feature among many unique refined artistic style direction detailed world lore mysterious yet alluring character incredible boss visual effect wide array weapon magic biggest area nitpick graphical fidelity time outdated
however mentioned unparalleled artistic design look feel make shortcoming texture quality
way color palette blend contrast beautiful lighting along sheer grandiosity land culminate remarkable difficulty punishing
let clear fan type game
rpg lover penchant medieval fantasy setting huge sword elden ring hit every spot
tremendous title age
good combatgood visualsgood storygood animated bitsgood bossesgood monke white dude start called maidenless hurt feeling recommend yes ca seems right track throne decay cautiously optimistic like potato salty game addictive grim darkness far future resource game
ingame shop provides cosmetic
""
critic regarding eula completely irrelevant shouldnt regarded
condition completely normal started phase today
far game quite fun
game loop seems like discover new area complete quest use certain amount station city scattered around area
end defeat bos go next area
meantime farm resource build base craft armor slay difficulty far really difficult
difficulty increase region
strong youll craft new weapon
nothing new kinda feel like mobile port
thaaaaaat bad
result fun game thats actually kinda addicting
kind survival game combined raid boss know mmorpgsedit input still recommend game issue
get warning click mouse fast
using furnace getting stuff may problematic might think
water pump behave weird
isnt much content think
every region like quest total maybe city town building discover
less done everything phase season
phase started yesterday
phase start next week
yes gated phase disable lot content keep playing whole season bug
running world yesterday fell troguh floor ran across void example stopping craft destroys already completed material opinion bug destroying crafting building also destroys material still inside well lag issue also even tho game mining farming
isnt much craft actually
thing improved version grind isnt really grindy wipe every week wipe good kind game week may bit short lot people boss far simply bullet sponge easily killed solo
exception wont able move would carry ammo would need kill thing lacking lot qol feature example drop item chest cant empty chest immediately
empty destroy thats far
would still recommend still fun play
beware may experience bit different
yes ok review time
first game amazing absolutley worthy sequel first love direction game went choice enemy tyranids rarely used outside rts genre small splinter fleet hive fleet leviathan ideal choice
slightly disappointed first chaos used second antagonist quickly changed mind revealed thousand son criminaly underused gaming instead one safe option black leigon first game
also loved part underground imperial tomb world ironicaly enough necron tomb world hoping future get necrons fave faction fight
hope saber interactive continues trend using underrepresented overlooked faction army future
said game without issue mainly dodge parry system work time many time pressed button indicator window onscreen still got hit got frustrating step get hit get hit take damage anyway simply gave trying use system halfway melee combat forefront gameplay left shooting aspect game feel quite weak underpowered customisation multiplayer character seems like sabre nailed first totally missed key aspect upon closer inspection
quite major thing think follows bulwark banner reason always ultramarine standard chapter want expect representing example salamander space marine planting ultramarine standard make zero sense want see fixed asap increadably annoying especialy fan shout using voice wheel suffer exact problem dont like fact insert chapter marine shouting stuff like guilliman
thats even primearch
finally chapter based cosmetic would really great imperial fist blood angel based wargear corect heraldry
finally leandros sorry spelling mistake dyslexia big editnow played game feel need add game opinion lot problem make hard recommend current state
completed game angel death aod solo reference
played operation coop least
played round pvp wo comment since really enjoy good direct continuation first
happy see show game role made sense
overall lore environment audio fantastic
horde enemy impressive set piece neat
like first loved using jump jet thunder hammer crash many thing combined made game enjoyable compared first game feel like designed coop first everything suffers
campaign filled generic objective like hold location press button etc
feel tailor made campaign experience cooperative one
everything forced load useless battle barge load actual mission
could easily ui ai teammate abysmal
focus completing object ex
defend chain
enemy almost entire ignore ally routinely rush directly player
doubly terrible aodthe game introduces somewhat fleshed dodge parry system kill shot system
opinion completely place
looking play dark soul looking play third person shooter
doubly bad timing inconsistent
sometimes simply hold defend button auto parry others precise
indicator match parry timing
kill shot system also terrible
share problem parry dodge kill shot ability used moment time interrupting whatever action currently progress ex
melee attack shooting
make game feel incredibly clunky unresponsive aod general whole melee combat system feel like originally designed much faster paced combat system cut ended dodge kill shot interrupting action neither tactical ability
nonsense whole purpose single ability campaign heal protect general combat feel like miss point made first one great
larger swarm weaker enemy bullet sponge enemy require shot damageall gun feel weak
might aod problem feel terrible use la rifle take one terminator
doubly worse carry less gun game compared new health armor system feel like step backwards
aod constantly hp regardless almost way heal combat like first game
everything touch immediately remove armor feel pointless
would rather armor health mean regenerate combat past white damage ca queue new instance operation always put one progress available
playing story like campaign suggests mean may start end one game decides
leave operation force watch useless scene battle barge return campaign incredibly assault class fun one also weak one
likely combination issue though
cant fly basic ledge overhang feel weak assume issue could patched sure may actually realistically improved
stand though full price steep ask get package
certainly longevity operation largely static variation aside enemy spawn
pvp pvp nothing special
sale game sure
much right wrong stuff make whole experience feel
game product received free would play everyday wipe every changed game would lift oof first short probably best modern soulsborne cinematic universe game gotten thus far pc bloodborne
pls
addition certain micro mechanic like jumping horse riding battle actual open world give freedom explore much higher extent compared game honestly great fun
would surprised average playtime til completion elden ring least game even entry series job fine think dark soul little better introduction series confirmed several time namco whoever else making money game
make b l u e bank money release game pc bloodborne ever got ported pc game would also absolutely bank money
fromsoftware literally one japanese game studio widely recognized loved west wish actually cared market much love
people played game know reviewer mentioned yt video computer quite literally way powerful console running game yet getting stuttering frame drop
entire thing reocurring thing soulsborne game ported pc kick ball game absolutely beautiful graphically challenging game recent time previous complain deter trying game
actually
absolutely would still recommend minor complains certain game design thing still absolute blast even half way game yet people completionists really make want explore every nook cranny warning get message know else get care steam market actually make drown dr fort night игра настолько хорошая что держится в списке лидеров уже очень много лет так что ребята покупайте и игре вы услышите цитаты великих людей azazaza mamky ebal гг изи катка ребята го обмен покупайте не пожалеете monke game good
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm guess good better day
love game stand community one
sometimes enough enough
girlfriend space marine guess everything gon na alright good wait buy goty edition game immortal empire probably stable worthwhile unless leave buggy like spent near hour game know much compared people think know game well
dmg stopped playing tell game terrible trhink valve care anymore community cancer donnt want edgy really mean almost never found nice teammate somebody actually good thought game usally find cheater brings next point vac absolute always fais find cheater way cheater get banned community report even player avaluate evidence tell cheating valve doe basically
learning curve huge u untill like hour since devoted much time game wont want stop playing sionce think e wasted much timeso still want buy game go lot fun think current state game horrible happy say wont come back
game top ofc good example need triple game good time first review steam think even tho game played hundred game
far combat technique smooth tutorial clear easy storytelling really task quest progressive wo progress game fast slow visuals wonderful sure character customisation overwhelming like inventory quick action hud setting good give amazing gaming update review come across game
give try free nothing lose
feel like berserk game great
wo find negative review revolving around actual game people shocked video game term service agreement
genuinely pathetic people play minute feel compelled soy tos crash steam review roleplay kind bastion consumer protection stupid hollow anything else braincells
game crashed launch cutscene crashed since
valid complaint lack fov slider odd also likely patched later
feel swayed negative review check hour played
ca stress much love able play private lobby
love playing buddy rando every medkit location grab everything go second battle
amazing
creative assembly done lot past month rectify previous mistake franchise
game extraordinary amount fun
gobbla nobody read review say anyone start comment like except
game deserves way better cheap lazy spam
completed elden ring got platinum trophy absolute blast diving pc
fromsoftware seriously outdone
elden ring nothing short phenomenal hard imagine ever top moment stepped vast mysterious world hooked
blend deep lore challenging combat stunning landscape incredible
gameplay smoth perfectly balanced making every fight feel like rewarding test world elden ring pure joy
packed secret hidden path lore keep wanting
environmental storyteling rich every corner map feel worth investigating
region uniqie look feel exploration never get let talk thing annoys catacomb dungeon
problem since bloodborne favorite game time
even though elden ring better bloodborne every dungeon still feel bit like job
hey still character build create elden ring better soul game
whether melee combat magic mix depth short elden ring game experience
fromsoftware set new standard genre maybe created new genre wait see dlc
played yet favor dive
regret
pain say huge warhammer fan overall found experience game less superb worth high price tag far many bug connection issue sloppy optimisation weigh game whilst bad feel like anything spectacular
combat feel stiff cagey transition awkwardly spamming melee move swinging wildly around place firing one two mag current weapon ultimately run ammunition ridiculously low amount ammo player allowed retain
anywhere near enough variety execution animation enemy variety sorely lacking
single player campaign good enough cool standout moment mostly bogged lot sub par segment bickering squadmates get tiring listen quickly
titus feel watered flat game supporting cast character stand much save handful
operation good working connect game struggle achieve best time
pvp multiplayer laughably unoptimised worst ping issue played multiplayer game year massive shame huge fan first space marine game multiplayer better ping server almost full decade ago well veritable host balance issue class score limit match far short long take get match first place
mode unfortunately also misfortune tied within obtuse sluggish interface
want customise character multiplayer mode requires matchmake mode time usually lead getting game even customise class loadout forcing sit several load screen actually ever load whatever matchmaked bad connection issue
much determine colour want space marine weapon want use
hub exists diegetic seamless way player experience game manages complete opposite since brings whole host problem ultimately ruin immersion hub first really want like game truth derived joy playing completion feel motivation trying finish last operation game fighting every opportunity stop getting wasting time seemingly spite
far cheaper price tag tuning could definitely recommend game current state baggage pricing advise steering clear one
get fun playing equally poorly optimised game least take much cash

old review moment warhammer unfinished pretty rough state compared
game hopefully better place though later also possible
sort game really thing go play warhammer instead
feb gamebuggy minute still worth purchasecba making full review u like total war grab u money idk im ur dad made review first high finishing legendary slaanesh campaign
love fun
ca say still feel way
patching fix game many problem abysmally slow
agree simply calling game trash moving actual race map etc
pretty cool play well hardly responsive push doomstack monster even moreso warhammer two already didtowers frankly broken siege battle unloseable chore due god awful ai last run played pretty much every defense triple speed waiting enemy die tier infantry tower bricked rebuild siege defense basically delay
soon destroy tower start rebuilding
fighting minor siege battle legitimately unfun fewer land battle map franchise truly lot really really bad performance visual issue people experience different level
people rig completely fine others super high end get abysmal performance campaign campaign fun
overwhelming majority community would probably agree
linear experience expand consolidate expand
turtle turtle turtle
rift cancer legendary lord spends majority time either realm chaos sitting favoured corruption settlement get rid cancerous corurption trait like replenishment severely hamstring certain faction
slaanesh run keeper secret trait literally unable replenish outside tier settlement
game design
narrative interesting impersonal whereas vortex story felt personal faction despite overall plot exact
supply line lmaothis game potential recently uninstalled
fun hardly work
difficult enough get campaign even ignoring absolute tide bug game still displaying trend poor management post launch frank disrespect game
good game
broken state ca recommend anybody buy sincerely hope changing review patch
way thing going ca see changing
game fence buying game wait
game good bone certainly masterpiece year
immortal empire released several update thoroughly enjoyable first campaign graphic card failed time
screen went black eventually came back black box half color gone
happened game including total warhammer ii
graphic card struggling far setting
simply put something wrong
know rumored denuvo optimization need done
even nvidia driver designed game release wise great
nitpicks sure ironed patch come
warhammer ii many issue launch well game refined enjoyable
confident game also receive love attention deserves take look forward future game update dlc mod
enjoyable ideal total war warhammer experience probably year whether game choosing wait hope enjoy game playing cheer
nice game cancer community bethesda sold horse armor ca sold blood effect
always start small monke hit
monke bonk patched issue able find workaround
big bummer still fixed absolutely recommend game
people cry baby game run great ultrawide come first season game fun f ck
like warhammer like smashing sh apart game
product refunded space marine feel like playing classic aa xbox game one rent local redbox week try finish sitting
game feel catered rental service worth full purchase
one way found playtime oddly nostalgic charming aforementioned reason another way found totally uninspired questioning spent game despite great visuals felt oddly antiquated
ultimately lot depth need game complicated one felt sorta time
sound like much fun theory often similar sensation mowing lawn exercise patience direct big mowing machine towards next patch unkempt grass much involved grass
said graphic great
wish ultrawide support sure package requires take month officially add
environment hoard look particularly amazing lighting also look incredible correct circumstance shame first hour game set almost entirely beige planet filled mud
speaking hour know campaign hour long
issue principle package really condensed space marine damn average becomes much harder pill swallow
personally interest online game mode someone seeking strong campaign like halo reach wolfenstien doom etc
left comparably underwhelmed
enough sink teeth
game feel though resting bit much graphical laurel justify amateur game experience
shallow combat aggressively short campaign emphasizes mediocrity package even true everyone true
draw universe endearing enough overlook inadequacy experience
lot better
mod maker saving banger mod
love game
horrible waste time
recommend completed first campaign able honestly review honestly really game prologue absolutely amazing campaign part really good lot really fleshed intriguing character mini story line know love warhammer minor element campaign enjoyable minor settlement battle enemy ai depending faction play feel like terminator chasing wherever go regardless safety point making want stop great issue saw likely get scooped next update two
expected new release sure people whinging game released great start point drop mortal empire going make game replay ability huge ca great record previous two title warhammer series frequent dlc addition expand sometimes completely change way game played
super excited see bring

""
could spend hour going everything wrong game
boil game stop fun turn feel like chore fun game
many bug balance issue bad ai programming game fun play longer hour
regardless much enjoy game business model alone make recommend
feel worth money asking old faction need refresh quality level balthasar received huge price cut
newer faction like ogre feel even look good begin
also locking new unit existing faction future paid content pack always leave bad taste mouth
name fight emperor product received free update took away best part game
lack map make game repetitive general gameplay lackluster
graphic certainly better alone ca make removed
many case game longer fun
product received free worth try
engaging satisfying combat detailed extensive base building wide range creepy enemy
hour run smooth entire time
like crafting survival horror one
throne decay believe ca changed attitude toward price dlc
option choosing would like buy reasonable price quite acceptable personally
game always fun replayable dwarf player thoroughly enjoy reworks new content added even need little rebalancing
conquer daemon as head
dont need warhammer play immortal empire nice devs go love supporting good feb play full game string word cap old review enjoyable campaign

ca get act together respect community allows make game purchase product support way game great reminds gear war take grain salt
ultimately refunded various small
performance stable felt bad
dlss turned default way turn good look many game drama game need dlss function
example remnant
ca play game dlss forced optimized setting combo high setting rt mid high setting
get around fps around
spent gaming computer last year play game max setting high frame rate
watching game come turn pc something thats comparible console
difficulty weird spike either beat everything pretty easy get pooped
two hour made area first official fire bos side bos big headed blue guy could beat either time game
combat action based hate ca dodge attack
ca tell many time would attack game ques attack even see something coming ca dodge way instead stuck attack animation speaking heavy attack feel weird try implement light attack without focus bead ca string heavy combo instead come stand still ques heavy attack
combat feel clunky fluid time difficulty spike direction
deciding factor time unfortunately game hour limit ca refunded take time seriously investment small cost rising
time hit play steam timer keep track shaders compiling minute looking option mostly graphic bench marking optimized setting took another minute even hit new game
already minute game yet truly try
fortunately watched couple people start able skip opening cinematic couple cut scene saving valuable time still left starting area hour limit came time constant little issue ca say certain whether game good issue enough make refund
going lose money game crazy
think need talk opening refund window game boast dozen hour content hour demo content
truly believe another hour might found something love could bring spend game meh hour minute
either die noob orlive long enough get called hacker
right discus entitlement earn playing game ca response censor right positive review entitlement earn making game
advice ca start actually caring customer
stop overpricing dissecting game unnecessary dlcs solely greed
want give thumb recommend
ca maybe year full game released sooner let disable chaos realm would say point
play second game
better
single play great game sandbox strategy game really want enjoy
hopefully year full game release chance fix come celebrate game honestly gotten close launch

yes
even warhammer awesome absolutely reccomend probably noticed people really enjoyed game others
fall category one mind realm chaos campaign many others despise
yes time annoying someone play vortex campaign total war warhammer quite used type campaign need wait immortal empire come pro game decent faction selection base game legendary lord different faction map large allows diversity enemy friend come individual faction mechanic every faction add flavor skarbrand exiled punting character across graphic pretty good especially higher modding community immortal empire yet
less kind forced playing soul race unless mod turn limited unit faction especially daemonic play warhammer one two race
faze know affect lot people fancy playing empire bias still strong much better release back february personally think game worth going get better progress year
waiting immortal empire would hold later year beta get set

amazing game
waiting game long time worth wait
ca wait future content improvement
good game total war community رهيبه know going wiped season every week game basically ruined
sweatlord way beginning grind memetic progression world progression unlocks every week
get want set level playing field around pvp part game people responsibility like family work supposed ever get anywhere require restart fresh character every week
season wipe changed sh time spent exploring unlocking new area map character progression completely wiped would recommend game thumb every closed playtest since first one
game much offer absolutely incredible experience absolutely ruining suspect sizable portion player base season wipe stance taking
hopefully open changing thing game went
actually going dump game launch support bc play test expected would great game support unfortunately holding see come better system season
people fine type fine time get reset like
beautiful game combat hard enough satisfying hard make discouraging elden ring good game unfortunately poorly kinda dismissed review saying bad frame drop thinking exaggerated experienced throughout whole sure whether bad optimization easy frame stutter constantly area others something deal also something heard pretty much everyone talked issue hardware rtx ryzen elden ring take lot fromsoft older title improves game way accessible lot way make experience easier also welcome quality life change hope continue expand future open world draw though fan dark soul old world design really gon na find thing note cut content still half game much notice something well bug play terrible coop especially invasion gon na bad time
even manage connect stay connected throughout whole time even got inappropriate activity detected error booted menu unable go probably caused sort false positive easy understand happened many people time later fixed still unpleasant much like fromsoft expect better triple product
never played game long accomplish little
much content game really pay attention everything understand lore
cup thing play however want
game easy hard want experience like weird dream
glad finished move next game
give empty feeling finishing first playthrough unlike finished witcher
great game best game decade
game moment
way much money product need add mod make fun leave cat everybody pass pet give thumb award フ l ヽ ﾉ play thru story
basically cosmetic tight schedule
playing lot keep try finish story season
season end get reset
play thru story story mean one pretty disjointed towards end feel rushed
warhammered two marine space great game great mechanic great everything
addictive
biggest problem community toxic cheat need team friend experience ten time better
duty
serve emperor
mid ring absolutely insulting disgusting pricing policy ca latest dlc
problem base game right
review negative simple ca effectively abandoned game last year
worked fixing glaring issue time time utterly failed keep word bug fix blatantly lied maintaining sufficient number devs working project tried pacify community releasing roadmaps intention ability follow overall left game lacking state
mention one among countless issue absolutely unacceptable people paid buy nakai dlc btw recruit kroxigors know single unit supposed use
call embarrassing would worked hard destroy remaining goodwill left disastrous launch game absolutely deserves get coming including limited low sale abysmal player retention
hopefully community effort make understand change attitude towards game order
personally though hold little total war community desperately need competitor bust scene light fire ca sorry buttock
goated time spent playing game could spent studying applying job making friend irl getting gf spending time family working becoming better man generalfrom time spent game got extremely racist homophobic vocabulary free russian lesson anger management issue borderline autistic tendency sleep would never uninstall game correct
please love holy practice deathmatch casual well perfect mouse sensitivity jump competitive
people thank
give mental issue wanted space marine game
delivered space marine game
wish could pay
dream come true
emperor
nough said great capstone series
give total war
honestly like forgot every single lesson learned past two game
get rate another year two seriously campaign somehow worse play
new darksouls type game bit learning curve
still die horribly often totally get people like game
nice butt
total war warhammer go one great rts franchise
scope game never matched rts insanely beautiful graphic
best fantasy rts tried true battle system massive unit variety
player build defensive offensive balanced meme ridiculous replayability campaign
race
faction unique starting lord location world extremely high production quality
sound ui detail everything exudes extremely deep multiplayer scene quite dependent game meta knowledge micro
unique faction mean unique matchup everyone always learning
embrace monke maybe goty game indeed beautiful control pretty easy pick
man monkey weak
take dozen hit rather heavy looking staff take trash mob kill pretty easily hit
made first mountain far open world confined narrow corridor
boss game basically grind trash hallway level beat one bos repeat cycle forever
temple town shop replaced one stop everything shrine system zero exploration
guess china answer elden ring except open world
kind people like sort thing sort thing kind people like
looking actual adventure game instead elden trainer one hype damned
really know happening time crab pretty sick great graphic great campaign great customisation
buy
emperor
𝙂𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙩 𝙜𝙖𝙢𝙚 𝙧𝙪𝙞𝙣𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙢𝙪𝙣𝙞𝙩𝙮
bought every xpac soc
earned idiot crown wear right speak game franchise history since saw happen
way back tw released hesitantly critical thing
usual microtransaction stuff figured gross mildly tolerable game enjoyed
locking unit behind
less tolerable
unit basically swinging sword one another nothing ever connecting
oh like liked zoom watch lad fight anything real incentive play multiplayer except momentary fun
still think currency mp battle eventually used buy faction suggested year ago could saved u timeline
hear team charge fixing game small cut workforce reaching like
money even go
saying thing like right discus privilege banning content creator justifiably upset
lesson dev studio
strike gold something like total war treat like art
pour make something proud treat like business product rot left brand leaf bitter taste fan mouth
course sure one making bad decision receive golden parachute go ruining project
franchise could something incredible done everything creative art
enlightening
enjoy hundred thousand
gave year
locking progress server seam cringe worth time spent game wipe would give grandma virginity play game first time update april decided change recommendation positive view recent news regarding layoff ca rampant rumor around total war warhammer iii scaled originally planned lastly addition shadow change pretty good
despite fact multiplayer campaign barely function despite random ctd unit seriously bad pathfinding around gate ladder warrior chaos cathay tech working properly hero enough skill put skill point still love game
lot love lie thanks modding community love work ca warhammer team put message sega
let game die get chance redeem whole reason due ca leadership incompetent touch greedy dirtbagspunish game make money despite best effort gun laying golden egg
update feb posted review ca made public statement apologizing quote wording apology corporate really make point owning mistake also promising better
vein cut price total war pharaoh refunded owner promised add content shadow change match asking price
happened late december
currently coming series blog post detailing added every race time writing cathay tzeentch update due next week
however changing recommendation yet whole ordeal going since game released
like consistently good good long honestly recommend game
plus still riddled bug
original review november sorry many hour entertainment game truly love given good conscience recommend
unfortunately creative assembly treating money maker always make money matter essentially abandoning process
idea support let haggard poor dlc team would wager less twenty people maintain patch produce content time increasing price absurd amount lesser quality content every dlc ever
meantime team stretched super thin glaring problem community addressed mere day via mod left game month time
imagine buying faction dlc focused specific unit faction completely unable recruit said unit three entire top thing came statement response community backlash latest price increase basically saying want money buy dlc drop support entirely tldr ca abandoned game
qa major bug game month end ca came ultimatum buy dlc absurd price drop support
pleased game convinced offline ca use ogre got epic address banned host list work fine long case playing steam want give epic anything even data yeah pleased gameplay get dont graphic audio audience pc requirement run nasa spare computer story isnt nothing greatly make cry smile alot playstyle little bit person character character ranged difficulity press bunch brain learn hard soul grind care necessary bit grindy sometimes grind bit game time enough cup price buy spare money left throw money rubbish bin game necessary want wait week construct toaster premium currency normal premium currency normal way show big get game big terrarium main campaign able completed due error crash broken game near functionality previous game series
still playing game doubt ever able finish campaign without major update game
pro look better compared unit map new mechanic really really want play game waiting finished play mostly finished
updated review reflect good work ca made last patch
longer win siege sneaking unit via backdoor longer required defend completely different area base order successfully repel still massive issue ai far passive longer build massive empire
ai longer confederate even empire rarely seems confederate elector count prevents faction becoming powerful
might ok lower difficulty legendary player need challenge
also ca say much despise making minor faction free win ai
glorious finding survived game
faction every single playthrough removed ability minor faction sometimes get upper hand larger rival
finding marienburg wiped empire mousillon conquered bretonnia joy starting new campaign
none bring back aggressive ai empire none whipping boy minor faction restored faith
shikanoko nokonoko koshitantan nokonoko koshitantan nokonoko koshitantan nokonoko koshitantan nokonoko koshitantan nokonoko koshitantan nokonoko koshitantan nokonoko koshitantan nokonoko koshitantan nokonoko koshitantan nokonoko koshitantan play die
smurf hack game mean kid n playergarbage vac sh monke new faction fine addition total war warhammer however campaign absolute
game really discourages fighting faction expanding
also realm tzeentch worst came
ai straight cheat walk end
follow path go portal throw different location
also somehow made siege even worse
think good idea build tower etc middle battle
think done battle preparation phase
guess resort autoresolve siege battle
least made military alliance somewhat useful build outpost recruit unit ally cool guess
man really dig new update
added late game encounter really darn pog system looking forward
however still baffle siege battle remained worst dogshite came
whether unlimited tower range able build tower mid combat game design imo
played volkmar generally loved campaign
wish easier get special unit elector count
unlocked book late game event usually start time elector count unit practically become obsolete come way late make difference campaign
take way long recruit
wish could recruit military alliance maybe
simply lower cooldown special unit
hundred hour almost every single dlc purchased full price since tw wh
love could convince friend play
lately would want even could
responding community patronizing language blaming increased cost without acknowledging cost certainly going toward game future track record abandoning game broken promise playerbase great reason ca leadership change career path
senior executive really much meaningful good sure damage
give dev team money time
stop plucking golden deeper dive dlc writing top
alone make anyone new franchise wince
new person would playing pared outright incomplete unbalanced version small percentage total game
mod would help
ca pay problem
update core upkeep game anything dlc get little attention
includes everything bugfixes balancing especially single player new free content qol pass especially older
reworks faction far dlc introduction seems get implemented without accounting impact existing faction
includes obvious thing like broken faction mechanic going unpatched week month also basic campaign fun sniff test least fun campaign start happened neglect dlc added hood core gameplay mechanic diplomacy trade addressed overhauled dlc lord faction left functional rest ai cheat lieu meaningful challenge etc
even map
modding community left carry load creative reworks revisits qol change fun
reason negative review currently three lord three least played faction make sense corporate balance sheet
even made hope would include reworks comprehensive retooling faction question whole make attractive play
win win ca player base
without without unique new mechanic core faction overhaul maybe even frankly three faction would least excited see dlc one lord always going stretch especially without freelc meaningful change faction universal mechanic
friend new game
friend stopped playing looking excuse dust game
part trend wanting nothing company game particular
game actually good fun
hate review considering tos people educated enough know read reading game one thing like game short term season
week enough time anything especially people got day grind
change return back game clear company trying regain trust consumer good sign
love game hope continue path
live love lie insultingly greedy dlc price
buy product
great game boss challenging fun beat important get marry ranni absolutely understand many rave review game
opinion get straight point blackmyth wukong solid game mean outstanding game year positive aspect graphic atmosphere taken away game
graphic far best ever seen game
texture detail balance general look game simply animation incredibly well done example animation change swing attack dodge move compared normal attack
creates high level realism soundtrack soundtrack wonderfully composed greatly enhances bos fight overall cinematic presentation cutscenes animation end chapter absolute masterpiece
though understand relate story fine cutscenes fight like intro final bos
actually main reason found game aaa title without extra cost bug cost trap additional content locked behind negative aspect story knowledge chinese mythology therefore perceived story accordingly
intro absolutely fantastic really hooked highly motivated learn god court fight
unfortunately becomes completely irrelevant
go chapter chapter searching relic chapter basically contains storyline
storyline neither interesting exciting
even develop connection interest certain aspect story chapter end different new storyline new character begin
character span across multiple chapter
result least motivation continue playing
end game eye completely nonsensical term story underscore cryptic disjointed boring story
feel like game trying hard like elden ring fails deliver story like fromsoftware map level design level design complete garbage
wander around hour map constantly get lost
time place also look similar almost find way around anymore
since game relies hud indicator generally think cool know go get lost even
problem world least gave reason explore
everything loot consists crafting material
give motivation exploration
armor weapon unlocked part story found fact invisible wall border map make better often think oh must continue run invisible wall
opinion belong aaa boss gameplay boss topic
firstly apart intro final bos exception find boss completely forgettable
boring waaaay maaaany look boring
case human animal head
get wrong attack visuals fantastic
think getting boss like fromsoftware delivers wrong gameplay one biggest criticism
extremely monotonous boring especially game least hour playtime
combo limited feel like three thing time
look boring long run almost killed desire play
dodging feel satisfying also partially random
often happened bos clearly hit ability dodged second later game registered perfect dodge
also hitboxes random know bug poor hitbox design
hammering away bos three move minute die hit clearly miss lose mind
fight bos spends time flying unhittable basically playing dodge difficulty big soulslike fan love game easy
different kind difficulty compared soul series example
elden ring feel fair difficulty
learn boss pattern move ability make try
wukong get feeling
game certainly easy really fun difficult either
feel artificially hard every bos rush endless combo every second bos turn invisible creates six copy ten tornado sweep across map touching one catapult air still dodge bos
time boss aoe attack love dash across entire map
feel artificially unfairly difficult
like saying minecraft hardest game spawn wooden sword room endermen
fun hard boring lazy
boss wukong disappointed looked forward game much
really never want deny much love went making game
sometimes passion love alone enough
game art
masterpiece
much fun
love concept main idea feel terrible mobile rush ported pc terrible trying many thing
please note game also ton reg file win startup recommend using revo uninstaller rather steam uninstall cause steam wont touch cause yk install steam start
follow autoruns remove start right click delete fella show thing following
already uninstalled game tap install pause revo find insane clunky little get explained without reading fighting pve randoms steal deviant able get first case fell cliff due shock wave mmo ton notification random thing mark read would random graphic setting issue always show setting need manual change file along setting people restricted server access
server menu population display v actual population highly incorrect often say server full population low addicted game heroin highly recommend even friend play
look forward come next fun
se eu assustar com essa p dessa galinha vou dar um murro monitor excelente jogo para quem tem resiliência de morrer jovem de ansiedade para quem aguenta valve te trolar tempo todo nele você pode conhecer um lindo mundo onde sua mãe é xingada você é chamado de chorão quando usam cheat e termina gastando milhares de reais com skin pixel na sua tela

hello
name bo human addict
logged morning something quick min
four hour later friend asking another silo dungeon
thank
counter strike hacker counter strike player deeply frustrated current state counter strike
despite potential game plagued everywhere hardly join lobby without encountering multiple blatantly use wallhacks aimbots delivering headshot smoke ruining experience everyone measure despite numerous report steam valve seem take effective action
report button feel useless serving decorative element interface
loss game quality fun challenge game offered gone
instead time spent annoyed obvious cheater hoping valve finally take effective counter strike potential hacker problem destroying need implement effective measure urgently
questionable investing time game worthwhile alright listen people
played warhammer space marine let tell absolute spectacle
imagine world chaos reign unstoppable force
yeah feel like first graphic
stunning
environment drenched grimdark aesthetic crave
step onto battlefield like stepping painting one drenched blood glory
almost taste power oh love taste gameplay
intense brutal
space marine superhuman unstoppable
charge fray every swing weapon feel like symphony destruction
visceral combat
poetry motion folk
playing let talk enemy
guy nothing fodder glorious rampage
hero legend one everyone look
know say fighting humanity even end space marine game experience
reminder power everything universe either god dust
grab chainsword unleash chaos
mean space want hero better ready step fire trust glorious
god game disgrace
obvious people work game actually play
right selling product feeling best
feeling dy within first turn realize hollow game really
word shakespeare sell market
like act scene line need tyranids
game still frequently crash
negative review big company ca make total war game supposed pretty experienced code stuff fix crash problem
great warhammer game everything expect space marine look amazing sound amazing play great
issue atm server hope get fixed soon
bench playing
enjoy nothing say tudo reutilizado retorno de pedro alves fromsoftware integrated different core mechanic created year also added basic crouch jump new mechanic spirit summoning guard counter enhance core gameplay deeply
new fromsoftware soul formula game accessible title ever get
optimization issue least
fromsoft artwork fine ever
sometimes stop companion torrent take look erdtree greatness magnificence might say holy game look beautiful despite fact graphical quality never fromsoftware primary concern
mounted combat best one ever seen game
torrent double jump made mounted combat far enjoyable expected
although admit sometimes get frustrating boss knock torrent one hit
spirit summoning fun boss way hard malenia godfrey radagon without summons especially melee user
lot aoe area effect movesets insane health stamen pool
sometimes boss never stop attacking
use spirit summons feel rewarded least case destroying malenia tear mimic
even though boss great loved theme sure
fromsoftware one signature bos theme
even ambience music try tell story
soon entered caelid know rotted corrupted place core ambience music
overall elden ring exceeded predeccessor changed meaning difficulty software magnum beautiful piece art
honestly game year
triple gaming deliver
agree sends big message budding chinese developer worldwide singleplayer game profitable
prevalent gacha game online game hopefully wake call invest instead gacha like
challenge since im dark soul fan im different difficult game fan mostly rhythm game however properly paced balanced
time camera weird large aoe hitboxes frustrating deal defensive option lenient
havent encountered bos took try take
especially want share peak moment spoiler fought heavenly king fight blurred cinematic gameplay everything flowed smoothly
experience
nitpicks tho like getting point point b pretty slow
especially chapter map size open
need mount cloud early least
encountered bug higher quality global illumination turn sun shadow lighting unless pick low
wish lore bit journal descriptive character instead story snippet
first time revised review game
originally given game negative review felt con outweighed pro
patch continuing play game feel elden ring deserves revised review giving positive score
however plenty con mention game breathtaking look
many moment wanting take screenshot enjoy scenery
even place elden ring still look great visuals top notch
software game really made game incredible eye
absolutely jaw dropping say soul game always linear well designed afraid software would handle open world
got ta say excellent job
pretty much almost go anywhere like exception elden ring took previous game placed one best trait anyways
much variety build go lot way fight ash war incredible since truly spice combat fact fight horseback fun overall
also every part world filled single place empty
many secret discovery unique boss hidden lore brimming
impressed say ever employee came spirit summons give raise
super fun concept best solution somehow ca unwilling play online
fantastic concept well executed soul like going hard
would even say elden ring hardest soul yet devs given people many way approaching fight
game reward player exploring getting stronger finding better weapon loot coming back bos overcome
build far superior depending optimize every build good enough long experienced patient game beaten even lvl character
go fight learn quest perhaps depth previous soul game well since many npc interact telling story quest one actually move around world impact story
fan favorite others npc well written definitely loved dynamic including fact outright help fight would otherwise struggled
completing quest line reward loot even lead change secret would possible despite elden ring good game great lot issue game even patch fixed improved problem explain game give little hint progress certain npc quest next go time apart main mandatory boss key item essential item forth
understand soul game past held back secret linear easy check every corner miss much
""
game open world devs went way hide lot stuff point need guide go
get want replay game invest properly executed
know fan say reward player discovering stuff fact quest marker completion entry anything let know gone take game lot since hate missing big one
ca seem friend much
help stranger use password game often disconnect downright crash
people cheating often pvp using meta stuff make die instantly bleed build honestly feel like devs balanced well
game amazing pve pvp
unstable exactly good
plus side helping struggling bos game let
game library issue stutter game time crash stutter hard
random nothing fix
upset due fact often quite terrible experience
graphic card date newer version game library besides infamous skyrim problem
personally think need patch fix since many facing issue game obsessed certain build strong make fight trivial even
bleed build hyper magic build destroy pve pvp
strength build hindering sadly many enemy fast hit harder tank heavy hit
also ash war outright broken
also meta game rather earning stuff easily run around collecting upgrade get weapon even killing single bos
know knowing possible make wonder handicap struggle overpowered start
rather struggle forced like previous game even method game many opportunity make feel need meta keep pve game great good would say
lot downside mostly hiding important information key item forcing scout possibly become overpowered win early
exactly best like benefit people since get level weapon fighting first bos tutorial bos
game balance questionable lot issue multiplayer meta disconnection crash
otherwise game fun engaging much content awesome boss much variety build want meta
giving positive score close still negative like first review hoping dlc come game waiting baited breath
ive played hour far defeated boss say feel ive already gotten money worth
game play feel amazing ive performance issue
continue play maybe edit review later worth buy
yes loving far product received free best game give trust factor green good free game far
horor dan dont like horor monke good
fromsoftware game played past minute loved
addition open world make difficulty bearable casual player keep challenge dedicated still want
open whole new spectrum possible trying new thing limiting subsequent playthroughs extremely satisfying
even mention multiplayer touched game possibility endless
buy fun
actually feel like game
played handful hour still enjoying wukong much first hour played honestly somewhat surprising typical fare usually keep game science sure include sardonic thank kotaku et al
award acceptance speech give number player temper tantrum drew game decidedly
well played
joining negative review dlc waaaay much
stop greediness
promised return monke experience interesting got compelling environment would cool allowed actually explore invisible wall interesting parkour monkey
go linear design ca explore come back particular bos trouble
important minute load every bos feel dodge attack combo deal health repeat try get hit random special attack deal decent damage animation even hit learn adapt dodge earlier cringe performance issue chapter one worked fine system chapter two straight as probably time test upgrade feel meaningless guess item skin look neatgoty
good day recommend current state fix performance issue good game trash anticheat cuz everyone either say smurfing cheat using aim trigger spin must say steam go destroys friendship get screamed every minute
like dota gun
enormous expectation put thousand hour dark soul alone
sadly er tainted design decision fully thought refusal question ideal framework first established demon soul ended wishing played later steam would finally add neutral context excluding discarded run multiplayer completionist almost entirely solo run lasted around hour beating every bos barring malenia without open positively elden ring inherits dna particularly combat crunchy brawl responsive control animation characterised aided expanded enemy weapon ability variety magic diverse signature storytelling return requiring piecing together environmental detail item description vague information decipher full picture avoiding interminable cutscenes overbearing hud land geographically impressive
fuse aesthetically mechanically diverse biome vertiginously stacked layer threading interesting discovery challenging navigation aided time day weather system add subtle gameplay thumb great meaningful
incredible fantasy brawler shine premise cursed world blighted existence artificially prolonged age fire unnaturally lengthened gwyn tragic legacy follower
ringed city dlc literally warped smashed series together ash remained end world time manifestation cosmic decay realm prohibited moving
creatively defiant metacommentary rejected pop culture engorged commercialised nostalgia humanity obsession past impeding new better world built using ludography show stagnation blocking progress
innovate avoid hypocrisy repurposed old combat mechanic weaponry new rhythm tonally shifted quiet hope face graceful sadness crushing desperation fix cursed world euthanise start anew instead retaining series unrelenting melancholy heart ignores
retroactively invalidates message moving unsustainably tired world repurposing year content deviate uncharacteristically clumsily
wish played made laugh cry stuck mind year ultimately something bigger powerfully resonated
er contradicts critique indulging repackaged nostalgia way disney maligned star war trilogy left people feeling worse towards franchise new film made story shockingly conservative almost identical plot point setting character theme back catalogue

want killing enemy brutal combat great d template alone earns er inherited praise emotionally philosophically challenging story pick d enough
release roadmap today game worth next year save money buy sale year two
first game absolute joy play
story mission fantastic cinematics really enhance experience
way operation work tandem mission also impressive
highly recommend tackling story mission order operation operation first spoil maxed two class comfortably handle hardest difficulty ease
pvp aspect bit design invested many hour particularly nearing end time game aside maxing class helping friend
really hope add another couple difficulty beyond upcoming lethal mode well extra challenging enemy mission
wish could experience first hour game somewhat lacking due limited number operation absence significant challenge reach level class
excitement start wane completing story also disappointing horde mode coming
however would definitely recommend game
expect staple gaming routine completed story operation much left keep give
product received free got game free promotion graphic card bought watched trailer never really looked
went expectation hype whatsoever frankly get game terrible level design bound hit invisible wall even place trying reach part level sometimes invisible wall prevent going specific angle reason matter go path also intuitive actually going around level trying find missed find small gap crawl progress hidden inside cave nothing tell found pure chance combination invisible wall level lack map find path make exploring combat feel wrong sometimes input character move related input right roll sometimes heavy attack ridiculous delay make feel terrible use
fight could start heavy attack bos start attack get punished anyway
barely damage boss kill regular enemy way easily make boss actual challenge well except actually finding unfortunately boss terrible arena design sometimes attack fast enough get attack right dodge
story relies way much base material read book none make game look pretty fun would play

sad day write review
twwh humble opinion best strategy time
grander strategy
paradox title accessible title
civ series
game quite like one
let get thought way explain recommend game although sure already heard despite loving title dearly
let start saying good game
phenomenal even
core every sense word fun
brutally challenging far accessible many paradox title example
dipped range strategy game steam epic gog growing playing cd copy game still day generally speaking love genre
grew playing age empire warcraft moving away rts game favour style game
eventually moving onto grand strategy total war
let tell blast
adore game spent many night playing one turn late work following morning tired overslept
sat watching video lunch break legend general fallen asleep total war stream consume life period time
regret single second
bought copy full price friend play share experience others bring community
mention despite low playtime genuinely love game even playing consuming whatever way annoying friend push
""
think highly
well experience quite like
easy learn hard master
despite perception incredibly easy pick play even little confusing first
game tutorial really excellent job teaching core need know rest pick play
unlike paradox game feel like need youtube guide open mandatory training play although suppose subjective based skill patience
research external work invested game good incentivises learn complicated good want improve get better term
unlike casual game like civ campaign two go motion actually keep atleast small part brain switched
even lower difficulty get smashed often feel like incredibly unfair ai
game actually end almost feeling rogue like nature play turn realise messed turn start using knowledge gained progress time getting turn realising made mistake account something turn repeating
incredible loop never get dull boring based simply fact every faction play uniquely
skarbrand blitzkrieg anything sight new personal favourite empire campaign slowly build playing politics managing multiple state affair
firmly believe faction anyone everyone find something someone like game
going brush gameplay lie great
ancient chinese say work
overworld map basically relatively simple style game
city ruin town etc various size location colonise control region setting conquering politicking way others
much say
big fun paint map colour type ordeal particularly unique game
battle game blow away
hundred later time thousand individual unit modelled animated smashing rts style battle
watch giant smash way tiny little nurglings small creature clump together make large monstrosity massive great unclean one charge rank lizardmen tactically chundering excreting
phenomenal type person watch ai battle youtube absolutely adore
hundred battle map hundred unique unit thousand animation sorry count one lot
immense scale spectacle way franchise really rival
importantly fun
winning feel great losing feel bad watched pack rat men slowly swarm empire city man holding line best faith steel binding
exciting gorgeous
never enjoyed getting as handed much
onto recommend game
two reason one ongoing issue state dlc recent action developer
dlc game kind egregious
going people say buy one want huge fan mentality
main draw game specifically immortal empire map faction across three game play one unified map
huge really brings grand grand strategy
spectacle genuinely incredible feat faction map
however around playable lord buying warhammer alone give access around lot gameplay get wrong around half chaos themed rest take pick slavic stew ancient asian hotpot much variety term visuals aesthetic
get full experience choice playing whatever want need pay hundred pound get every dlc every game every dlc game
bit much
something total war fan put something financially supported due disposable income enjoying game
however new player imagine looking game thinking want complete experience access everything game finding spend well option play race
like try race either demo campaign lasting anywhere hour try refund realistically
something looked past long time recent event support model anymore
recent event
heard reason everyone reviewing negatively
creative assembly forcing unwarranted price increase already quite minimal dlcs
third price game might add three lord one particularly excited asking addition real new unit issue coming one add serious bug still refuse fix ignore frankly quite disgusting response fan criticism feedback vaguely threatening cut support game fan choose pay dlc
company revenue increased last year release update speed would generous call slow claiming need keep market excellent strategy simultaneous team play marked improvement earlier version especially combined assault
enjoy huge map fact computer faction varying result interaction making new dynamic time play high elf eliminated meet expand instead
variety plus scad faction make
try game future submitted refund request time
game stutter frequently especially bad audio mostly cut scene
audio lag extremely delayed cut scene
playing run pretty smooth time still suffers occasional stuttering
look forward getting future optimized game play fun satisfying story concept appealing
pc stats msi superryzen mobo hard game competitive
amazing game buy
waiting update jump back game hogtied bug poor business practice
chief product officer said buy dlc want keep supporting game continue support want u buy
new dlc way overpriced get could get much money anywhere else ca ripping gifted may yet strive
content little lost lust
seek ease yet crave renown
yearn freedom yet aspire buddhahood
always want
yet nobody nobody
upcoming dlc better aaa game 시대가 온다
game
hate every second product received free game good great day dlc higher cost pricing bad bad
haah headshot potential brother review pinned
game good imagine best competitive fps
stupid special power skill run without making noise regen life
everything play aim intelligence teamplay
superb huh add cheat majority game
team opposing team
sprinkle inactivity valve nothing make game c
best fps world ruined cowardly player retarded company
ca play singleplayer game offline
pay blood fighting game dlc price roof ground gain freelc listening community loose crappy business praise mod community never forget medieval warhammer mod good please opinion based angel death difficulty played solo
may issue lower difficulty good game game alot issue recommend even slightly interested pretty good parry system sometimes issue multiple parry come
time one right another pop seems cancel sometimes get hit even trying parry attack
dodge always seems work problem game really wonky hitboxes get hit dodging wonder even hit espicaly boss oh god bad boss invisible hitboxes hit even ar even close
carnifex worst healing system awful angel death melee restore health becomes pointless take much damage never get back enemy jumping
health injector rare many section game laughable
fury mode becomes main option healing want avoid combat stand recharge feel counter intuitive actually meant forthe gun feel great sound really really weak
know mixing issue something lack real oomph bolters sound like firing semi automatic pistol something kinda suck gameplay wise found using almost weapon one point another getting result
lead alot experimentation exploring system really major bug level glitch cant pickup gun item looking cargo elevator also sometimes ai totally bug refuse rez walk towards get distracted run back forth meter tick infuriating
sometimes ai totally loses stand still nothing large period time
also randomly acheran giving speech hanger walked watch space marine came behind trapped reload entire game got stuck really game fall trap difficulty wise alot game turning thing bullet sponge alot damage opposed real difficulty
ghost tsushima mastered honestly angel death lowered health pool enemy kept literally everything else would way tolerable actually fun
put clip bolter run get full reload another couple clip zoanthrope get go becomes point hilarity
although remedied krak grenade game seems keep forgetting grenade pickup basically become extinct certain part game campaign time becomes kind slog many major set piece stand thing prevents meter top corner going
distracting watch meter want actually look whats going screen annoying feel uninspired like complaint though entirely remedied section game jetpacks
honestly think built entire game assault troop feel amazing
quick movement escape horde jumping melee picking enemy air
feel like thats game played
almost turn fast paced becomes glorious
pvp also fantastic think keep updating map unlockables real leg stand like solid maybe biased fan finally good game
absolutely love csgo
remember going cousin house younger saw playing either c csgo always begged let play
never year later finally got game got join fun
game amazing
love communication aspect community time
worth money
recommend
product received free damn game alot thing need learn good game game alright book
okay kind disappointing compared
new faction okay kind bland
also disappointing include older faction
story interesting make round invasion progress got stale quickly
released roadmap change making next year mostly fix balance change addressed game came interesting new content horizon
see game getting better least year insane power gameplay
fell lantency class maxed
spend money game till issue resolved
spending money result negative account balance well item lost
far customer support helping case people involved bug
issue store allows purchase loot box take away charging twice
also cause money balance go negative
going take money item purchased least refund money take item back put loyal customer account negative
seen day since happened customer service helpful
spend money game till issue resolved reject modernity return monke game unplayable good chunk people want play
constant crash trying every fix found online
ca even enjoy game brand new install
game look interesting glaring performance issue preventing even playing game ti good
أغلب سيرفرات الدنيا موجودة إلا الخليج العربي ومضطرين نلعب على الاوروبي على بنق وفوق ياخي سيرفر واحد مابيضركم دامكم دافعين دافعين أو أعطونا سيرفرات مدفوعة مثل أرك وباقي الألعاب ودعنا نستمتع يارجل like game
like lot
recent patch broke game performance lighting making fix ca give thumb
game way better back compared state new arcadish feel
new update focused releasing new skin content update though made game worse
original map remake cartoon looking character remake sound degrades new crappy menu arcady looking team select newly released battle royale mode move making csgo killed game imo really fun game want feel original csgo like way better leaving csgo crap
stupid game infested load hacker regardless prime
emperor
free fun
enough pve fun far
see pvp could mess spend money god roll weapon cosmetic really nice base building amazing
wan na chill enjoy really good pve experience would recommend
also free
would kindly message friend code found helpful could get reward emperor protects brother
bad new trade system
disable new system product received free cool story nice grafics upsetting experience first time
therefore let joy nihil
every person gave game positive review launch deserves bug broken feature overpriced dlc
ooooo elden ring publisher went nut trying hike dlc price failing fix bug month month fact update break even stuff well away game work consistently stop trying price gauge
ave dominus nox
everything knew would great ascetic great game
ca wait immortal empire
u get bored playing always use stockmarket buck game ca even play thumb game get fixed
cant pas cut scene number requirement met plus changed setting nothing
smh
pretty good game honnest
hate game
try finger hole playing minute video without communist party would new china brother hao view without communist party would new china brother hao aka red song king good brother chinese communist party ccp founding political party people republic addictive fun gameplay would recommend reading book journey west make feel like playing back xbox day right way fantastic game fromsoftware probably best game ever made alongside bloodborne
gameplay formula mainly stay expanded exponentially world get play unlike game option challenge fairly limited farming become really good reading bos movement elden ring provides plethora option
explore world find new weapon level buy find several unique item made work boss like quite accessible lot love mean game become easy oh probably hold largest amount boss game ever released
staggering unique well recurring one
recycle say take much experience give feeling growing becoming experienced showing struggle effort well worth item weapon well magic give many option many build thing mess around character case something like well resetting ability case want try different build
addition great mean remake different character case want try something map huge enormous even direction go stumble upon something interesting
thing either quest collectable crafting item various dungeon enemy portal weapon ca put finger game truly something special going
downside like mention wish part start game well feel fun challenging everything rewarding later part game become absurdly difficult stat game quite important unlike bloodborne instance
elden ring provides fast moving ability spell still match bloodborne speed mean chance getting hit quite high unless going shield
thing enemy late game one two shot make feel effort put game naught bad surely fun
exaggerated difficulty spike could reduced little bit maybe
boss super cool found issue camera sometimes
big large boss love fly across screen
lock system useless situation since mess
wished would innovate part bit take risk zooming camera pvp game good broken build shot cheesing cheating list go
either love huge fun care unless invaded playing
likeness mode depends player
mind fact good everyone
last negative say isss huge complex dark fantasy special
bloodborne rock front dark soul elden ring masterpiece game
perfect flaw game unique brings something new table remembered
csgo multiplayer shooter
unlike previous version often difficult get one offer variety mode appeal skill level
large community well supported workshop ensuring game around year short either play good bad guy must either kill team complete objective win round earn money thing faster
around year spawned many game much looker based engine original half life
however valve polished much community consists lot awesome mapper churning brilliantly imaginative beautiful map almost daily worth getting already counter strike source
yes
cs always counter strike source engine
csgo feel far like standalone game
valve carefully listened people wanted made appealing game
best feature must competitive play
leave match suffer temporary ban feature
win mode ranked paired people skill meaning game challenging fair regardless skill level
match exciting occasionally scary frustrating rewarding part game improving rank one satisfying experience video game ever
ehh pretty cancer still fun questionable performance unfortunately cloud fun absolutely game
quite capable computer use graphic setting sparingly get constant fps
therefore recommend game moment
dollar get prime acc honesty give additional fun ever
wanted game could shoot people becomes free dont get refund
need prime acc people cant pay play hacker
b abt vac unhackable pure crap
move make free big as invitation hacker poor start hacking
hope gaben choke pudding christmas
incredible game
felt want finish game badly long time many achievement thing along way
combat feel great understand use different stance together along spell spirit
story amazing make want watch show listen audiobook really understand everything
said chapter one bos chapter great
scorpionlord secret bos chapter along first final boss chapter feel unfun
lot flying moving game take learned entire game throw away even punishes
along chapter feel unfleshed first instance see boss literally granted mini boss
case still loved game time
plan going least couple missables think tired game rate solid
incredible fantastic fair except instance thrilling length feel great
excited future dlc
game fantastic need work communication graphic map character economy unit aim realistic unit movement anti aliasing ai diplomacy rational decision making ai hud tutorial time load synchronization launcher understandability getting new developer mention affordable
like girl cool game absurdly overpriced
definitely go high sea would illegal
dlc way expensive base game feel incomplete cant recommend
product received free definitely well rounded game interested go hopefully continues get content added ill edit review ive seen pvp dlc pricing lack bug fix ruining game
emperor
best game ever lot controversy surrounding launch personally still annoyed continue gimped mod scene half year launch overall yes great game another great entry series
long term plan sound amazing ca credit substantially open communication time around
already good expect become great time
somehow bed deserving second review bomb elden ring open world game set world ruled demigod populated beautiful environment structure allowing player traverse land discovering secret engaging battle mayhap get problem low fps capped pc user solution internet help rectify issue addition also fps stuttering time annoying game still much playable
said let u get think great dislike elden boss fantastic looking fantastic flashy move set however main boss attack fast dodged insanely long combo always sort aoe attack always keep moving making hard hit melee weapon
malekith black blade fit point vie stated ranged ability difficult dodge attack due wide range attack also making hard run away heal dot damage time hit blade
trend continues boss making quite boss giant boss also quite hard battle hard see going attack using melee due needing boss duo boss fun fight considering kill within hit must focus attention enemy considerably increase difficulty cheap enemy game fantastic wide variety epic design making world feel populated however made quite annoying rotten stray constantly staggering lesser kindred rot spammable ranged attack bladed talon eagle hard hit melee user dungeon fun area explore containing resource help player giving better weapon useful material
however dungeon boss large area placed mostly referring tree spirit enemy
fighting small room extremely difficult due combination third person camera large bos small room making quite challenge know going mention aoe attack bos basically reach entire long read boss quick many aoe attack avoid handful enemy annoying fight duo boss hard fight without summons possible hard keep track giant bos attack small area big boss hard fight world elden ring fantastic needing always rush head towards bos first always explore grind level get better equipment trying battle boss addition better equipment also use summons dramatically make fight combat game decent many different attack light attack heavy attack rolling light rolling heavy jump light jump heavy sprinting heavy sprinting light guard counter block parry unique weapon skill applied weapon
also switch two handing one handing weapon well dual wielding weapon type well mounted combat
also introduction system
familiar sekiro like posture system
hitting enemy enough cause stance break leave susceptible critical hit also applicable boss
attack cause stance damage others jumping heavy attack counter hit charged heavy little different game rather rolling pressing button roll button rune boss enemy little low
rune scaling also improve much enemy progress difficult area boss drop rune
rune get boss enemy increased permanently aside issue game exceptional one best maiden pick simulator ever played solid definitely would recommend anyone want get franchise anyone masochist
nice game full toxic player warhammer space marine despite fact review positive yellow type review hope eventually add steam though starting doubt
game look expensive polished good overly long action game set warhammer universe excellent cutscene direction beautiful visuals
combat look epic gameplay gamepad really well done
joystick vibrates even reacts walking giving character space marine suit sense weight
warhammer space marine screenshot warhammer space marine wooohooo however positive end
really bothered
first combat feel quite repetitive
smashing enemy fun first hour quickly get stale stop enjoyable
moreover noticed difficulty seems bit broken higher difficulty level combat turn unpleasant mess
constantly spam parry even enemy still flank make life miserable
lower difficulty one notch game becomes easy uninteresting
warhammer space marine screenshot warhammer space marine wooohooo variety enemy small pretty dull requiring special tactic defeat
multiplayer pvp mode way terrible like recommend
feel like sake special operation run parallel story considered positive aspect let try different space marine class include progression
however add much depth game though make bit better
warhammer space marine screenshot warhammer space marine wooohooo fan warhammer universe want switch brain enjoy action shooting couple evening would recommend
best high expectation got way
personally love game although still need balancing part newer game
personally favorite qol added simultaneous turn make much easier enjoy friend
threaten player like game
game great except balancing network single worst thing matchmaking operation
probably worst ive ever seen getting loaded game people class class people changing mission originally queued starting
leave game row tactical already change positive fix
elden ring initially sucked immortal empire like predecessor best biggest content rich strategy game ever created
learn use ak pull mouse good mouse hit one tap
game
game good greatest game ever made period
debate
think know enough conclude agree either ignorant wrong xd warhammer space marine launch good video game feel look bad as playing also held back pretty hard opinion feeling repetitive gameplay never really evolves first mission last
game decent story singleplayer mode good operation pvp mode surprisingly good game launch missing simple mode like mode feel like brainer sort game ca help feel little bit disappointed missing among thing also design problem opinion come shield regenerator execute enemy system make compete team mate getting health back played know talking feel intended lot like design flaw combat health system operation replay launch keep somewhat short right launch content give solid likely easily go even future content
definitely play operation pvp mode much longer know
people complain game hard game chaotic
game chaos like chaos go back warhammer
blast
none reported issue end
went pretty low expectation gave shot cause free play
regretted minute
let ship game completely broken underdeliver empty promise make sure main focus graphic missing c go content utterly broken movement would thought would result massive rng input lag even bother testing right
also huge fan idea game shipped upgrade c go valve basically forcing play able merge review c go pretend like everything alright
valve really cooked

never felt like ripping another human being head
uninstalling reinstalling became daily routine millionth time clueless teammate cool skin guess skin skill matter feel like everyone need play game least acouple time thrill clutching fragging etc unlike anything experienced
take back good old gear battlefield day clan battle either gb underground rule blah blah blah
true fps fun age
casual player fun mod competitive def enjoy

decent world concept unique skill interesting character design feel like lacking something
kinda surface deep
pretty surface thats get
get sale save time money
good old tyranid smashing time
continuing building first game ca wait see continue add game
ok expensive dlc little behind lot bug patch bringing new one disrespectful player baselooks like ca want milk much recent expansion game rather continuing success warhammer ii valve turned game sausage fest game taken rare item playtime incentive system give game cheap feel
system clear indication time move year creation original break free stale c formula
bring something new engaging table please leave hat home
game decent first came year blast teaming randoms making friend play competitive
competitive mode really brought best game offer
upside tom clancy rainbow six siege may answer new competitive fps standard breath fresh air people waiting
please feel free thumb review c go game ever played quite enjoy playing game recommend current pricing structure
get point purchase three separate videogames still complete
although way thematically appropriate game workshop product make less greedy
writing review ca gone back warhammer level incompetence one
loved warhammer loved warhammer much much
highest hope warhammer far ca provide
game stagnant warhammer constant path improvement admittedly come fairly bad game
difference however urgency ca action
warhammer released content good fast also charging reasonable price dlcs mortal empire came much sooner immortal empire
warhammer like year since launch game similar game launch
provided less improved less yet charge also removing free content
change point feel like game come back track far feel like back warhammer stopped playing ridiculous dlcs realm wood elf call beastmen dlc overpriced yet still cheaper new lord dlc
come pricing look dlc tab recognize ai free stuff acknowledge game rarely getting update somewhat lackluster state realize point game want game
essentially went game knowing expect
advised many cry complain disagreeing review honest factual
game offer fun ever however recommend game anyone deceptive
could spend hundred hour grinding farming upgrading collecting deviant nothing
apparently every new season much worked removed deviant one major one
known would never started playing game
teasing player punishing type system wipe
people play game many want farm deviant item continue losing every season
game alot potential extreme turn believe one feel way
combat bug least worry accept game bug yes server lag
never wanted leave review game loved passion starting
involved game production creation inception starry studio netease game exptional global plain wrong
spent game via microtransactions felt cared player offering solid product
angry enjoy money need far
edit overture made shadow change update patch nontrivial step right direction
community letter preceding certainly sounded like coming right place amount content offered free update feel like commensurate material change studio looking truly change direction
stand downgrading outright concern wariness hopeful development headed previous right discus privilege normally like getting involved dev drama go
price increase dlc bother dev response recent criticism indicates level delusion bode well aspect ca work development community engagement etc
huge fan tww series know make future purchase unless clear change direction
product received free game made nolifers u leave aside week progress wipe game cool af
idk pvp pve another level
negative thing game already said progress restart
every aspect amazing
still unplayable
denuvo destroys game performance
played thousand hour plus
think clocked decent number hour offer genuine reliable game
reason would recommend game would two say community horrible
people show sign mercy new including time

constantly get disconnected mid game fail find server matchmaking
probably disconnected time total playtime
keep crashing latest hotfix probably best visuals aesthetic seen game long time
like roulette fun turn russian
everything amazing game time estrogen nice testosterone игрулька во
one greatest warhammers ever warhammered game best one
dude story cool wish china real really recommend one
term agreement indeed full trojan authority
ccp chinese communist party demanding much player interested game
passport id linked account steam psn xbox id include password also running game ram consumption spiked kaspersky flagged trojan indication probing every registry key pc support gaben read
please thorough inspection game term agreementsedited playing hour since last friday august played hour new updated term agreement remove clause passport id id card therefore make fair asian region
play first time term agreement already make fair ask passport id id card vulnerable scam
disregarding overpriced dlc actually pretty awesome game
immortal empire feel like fan deserved
seeing dragon get shot rat miniguns dinosaur wreaking havoc poor dwarf extremely fun
sandbox element player base seems healthy enough
multiplayer need balancing actual ladder system instead ranking would nice
try achivements
ambitious refreshing focus cinematic action hyper dynamic combat away usual open world fluff gotten way control since mid little linear cut straightforward chapter contained area almost retro nostalgic way really miss beat thanks stunning epic cutscenes frenetic unique bos fight constantly pushing player forward chapter yearning
sometimes pushing little far ahead detriment story time offering incredible character lore along touching moment lot research journey west chinese speedy dynamic although quite precise usually pretty clean readable
sometimes turn messy weird camera movement even weirder hitboxes
somewhat uneven localisation least english frustrating amount invisible wall
definitely spent long time cooking ultimately feel like great first step chinese aaa gaming
fire ah game word amazing ring latest soft entry entered gaming scene one biggest hype train ever seen
dust settled station mostly agree game definitely lived hype albeit small caveat
first great game wonderfully illustrated world building inhabitant design detailed local flora gigantic enemy feel unique alive
almost guaranteed player would stop awe surroundings every take world npc one meet along journey also feel colorfully animated dynamic questline player follow tradition soft game
however careful character questlines either easy miss messed bigger world also mean much bigger variety player build character
weapon definitely strong suit game one hidden every nook canny world awaiting adventurous player seeking beaten path
special effect weapon spell incantation game feel extremely beautiful way badass
good beautiful game pc suffer performance issue like soft port pc
patch released iron major problem remain
serious personally random feel unique bos fight quite epic rather unavoidable game world scale eventually resort reusing enemy boss turning boss early game later game common enemy vice versa
though ruin experience whole get little repetitive see biome change enemy game also serious balancing issue later game content way overtuned forcing player invest heavily hp order survive
boss ahem malenia feel frustrating fight due unfair unfun mechanic
spell player utilize also feel broken turning part game cake walk tend stay away finally size occasionally feel burnt exploring world vastness
policy along intentional vagueness game disorient discourage newer player adventuring
hence found game enjoyable short burst rather long playthroughs time
game great despite flaw
take goodness previous soulsbornesekiro title mash together open world frame unforgettable dish new fan definitely enjoy
matchmaking bad trash turned omega trash update
game still isues mostly performance

""
peak gaming try finger hole
game year thank game science masterpiece dlc less money please war hammer till really good
work linux game developer completely touch game launched huge amount content impressively bug free part insane roadmap downright inspiring visuals audio
pc gamer gave favor pick game easily greatest content gotten year also simply fantastic game
used saw panickedi started shooting randomly headshotted use pro mushroom picking simulator amount content promised actually shadow change dlc refuse buy lowering astounded company stay business
would good consumer bought like like grim grave aforementioned dlc shadow change contains legendary lord separate different faction handful unit faction along subfaction mechanic three legendary layman know talking legendary lord one playable faction usually legendary lord made arrive faction pack style similar various smaller warhammer dlcs pretty much buck new legendary lord
dlc particular priced
chaos dwarf dlc game also met mixed review creative assembly want survive better start going back direction vampire coast tomb king dlcs gave entire faction full unit roster legendary lord entire campaign fully voiced designed faction
especially prevalent vampire coast dlc dude handful unit price plus five buck addition alot content dlcs even missing various campaign scenario cutscenes campaign content vampire coast come version dlc one cornerstone buying dlc first place
know everyone loved mortal empire believe legit point regarding fact alot content straight building various occupied variant important capital present generic occupied one
various landmark building even warhammer cylostra opera house
come ca literally made character move landmark building anywhere nobody going whine essence seen gigantic money laundering scheme relationship afraid going get war total war warhammer dlc policy put
throwing dlc crap u going make anything better come ca paradox interactive need nickel dime u already get nickeled dimed game workshop various legitimate retailing location website buy actual figure tabletop game based need invest new mechanic eventually ca talking legendary lord mechanic talking legitimately change actual gameplay
people literally calling total war troy total war warhammer freaking game little difference unit roster one game workshop licensed game
empire special building province shogun dipped heavily daiymo diplomacy improved empire started term varying difference map
everytime creative assembly game release fixed differently named version slightly altered formula game later
example rome attila
starting get cavalry even compare earlier total war title cavalry total war attila last game felt like cavalry charge creative assembly charging upwards freaking dlc game pretty much prefabbed engine literal engine total war empire
let sink
want release total war pharaoh engine
give break
actually invested literally title point feel like money wasted empty promise hear hear single sight
like putting pr law team unity technology
mortal empire game become better
looking forward see chaos dwarf
watched content game whatsoever game getting
smoke mirror
still hope properly informed scope game whole game radar almost year somewhat concerned got delayed year man incredibly happy decided game feel insanely polished
played game solely low graphic entire main campaign still one atmospheric gorgeous game ever played
familiar warhammer capacity somewhat tourist know lore tidbit like love aesthetic wished long sort immersive experience take place franchise world form turn based game must buy instantly
campaign amazing around hour content felt perfect short bloated
finale drove edge genuinely incredible high note add plenty satisfied surely make bunch loreheads incredibly excited happy see small complaint would seem game generally scaled individual player given bot companion actually useful
recommendation getting game friend go veteran difficulty experience game way advise higher difficulty solo
impossible feel overwhelming enemy ever focus anyone tasked using best gear leaving real room customization experimentation first time playing game
aside much else care oh aside final bos seemingly letting go preferred loadout main campaign
seemingly place happens sure intentional
granted played course first day ultra gold edition owner surely get patched week operation incredibly cool lot replayability many player customize class specific space marine many level fashion
still waiting friend get since got base game without headstart excited play mission note wish kind chaos customization damaged way
also going lot content coming least next year half developer actively released roadmap explaning addition full enemy class operation mission entirely free paid dlc coming form cosmetic plus talk adding full playable class future
see talk actually go anywhere ca say idea stand yet game excited plenty experience unlock
extremely grateful everyone involved creating product clearly made since come officially day born
excited see come future great game
miyazaki game award graphic forget reality look long gameplay watch paint dry audio deaf audience grandma pc requirement check run rich ask nasa spare computer game size floppy old eat hard want entire hard drive hold need invest black hole hold data difficulty press easy learn hard significant brain dark soul grind nothing u care necessary average grind much need second life grinding story replace life game time long enough cup infinity beyond price free worth u spare money could also burn money bug never heard minor get ark survival game big terrarium bug
genuinely enjoyed game like space marine long time
feel like prime xbox era game grew playing gear war game ez win
gg game fascinating game game science
first ever journey west related game ever played far surprised well game
firstly gameplay one best part game
lot system play regarding transformation spell heavy attack option
skill purpose use diffferent situation offer large flexibility whole lot fun play
monster considered hard proper use system pas quite easily
story good deep
story journey west
different view aside form main story focus darkside regarding story journey west
story well written presented cinematic form greatly help immersive experience
chapter also short drawing animation present summarize background story current chapter might highly relevant chapter even make interested happen next
game also give menu list enemy fought person met along journey along long background information
music also well chosen suit situation well especially music transformation definitely lit
story game also content downside might ruin experience mentioned definitely map
mini map game making hard time memorize walk around map without idea going
graphic view game good help unreal engine sometimes might experience lag spike playing monster lot effect like fire lightning might destroy gaming experience
camera also frustrating especially playing large monster small space
spot might need improvement fantastic game interesting gameplay graphic story music
flaw game good overshine bad give good experience
mentioned alot side quest hidden bos game find miss bos enemy list make sure run whole map patiently miss good content
recommend every action game lover
good old fashioned fun per usual nitpick ganging smallest thing review without people reading actually taking time experience
pro con like free play
astounded character customization get comparison game buy
decent amount content place explore fun little thing collect lot many early release game buy claim
game completed hour less new content continues released decent pace finish current content least
enough comment free game
new feature astounds
better yet pay
enemy bit easy starting zone make pace feel slow combat little dull
base building could also use touch piece snap together
curved crescent shape snapping underside ceiling otherwise enjoyable move base away first zone everyone heavily crowded
also little iffy seasonal reset play limited work family feel might reach end reset little starved finished game tired hell paid early release slow moving promise
still breath fresh air worth giving chance
cool turtle pope skull skill throne despite dying lot fun exploring beautiful world
gon na lie vac garbage overall kinda enjoy game
operation every breathing new content see balanced fps game
support server like esea faceit give better solution higher level player
overall hour recommend game
perfect nothing perfect
b clear killed smoke nade seriously point resurrecting glory mysterious valverating ive played every soulsborne game date far best game put
take great thing previous game mash ultimate experience feel good around
story hitting hard lot dialogue interactive story fun
well brings back relic past game
feeling new fresh
game isnt perfect mean minor glitch stutter nothing seen worse game issue easily patched
game already sunk hour writing review reached little halfway point game much enjoy previous fromsoft game love game feel play looking game reward persistence drive maybe give shot
may game thats alright everything
overall personally love ive seen far ca wait play since release skyrim craving open world experience rewarding combat build theory aesthetic real sense accomplishment item dungeon completed etc game delivers entire experience way never quite seen
new genre fromsoftware game
takeaway
combat extremely rewarding unforgiving
first glance hard delve little deeper realize combat game art form take practice practice
satisfaction higher game played last decade
light attack heavy attack block parrying sprint attack sneak attack play little different allow really pick method avenue approach
""
item game armor weapon craftables ash individually potentially game changing build changing really flesh
rewarding find item game one could weapon choice desired build
""
open world absolutely stunning feel scary yet exciting
every new enemy seen need studied practiced learned optimal combat
new enemy scary immediately know capability
bos fight hard others many enemy type require come back later time stronger tool hp git gud
roaming new area thrilling begin truly balance manage hp fp stamen combat
lighting cave torch lantern immersive feel
character building straightforward
level beat enemy use rune xp currency see fit either purchase thing level etc decide attribute increase
trying new weapon new armor fun interesting
need know
game wo hold hand
labyrinth many thing kill
know exactly going existing
""
everything see kill become careless
slow steady usually best method
slow smooth smooth
ash war summoning crafting must experimented understand
hand
ask world supposed ever able complete
many many
puzzle secret abound exploration good memory key
""
multiplayer experience pvp pve bit confusing experienced far necessarily mandatory
single player experience strong spent hour game writing barely left starting area limgrave
nightmare consist runebears traversing mist bos fight
startled pillaged rekt absolutely confused many time would change
remember first time saw giant attack titan flashback began trying summon inner captain levi
blast
absolute blast
greatest feeling accomplishment start beat boss new enemy first attempt
feel ability reaction time coming play practice creates thrilling experience
struggling enemy type hour come back day later realize much stronger faster gotten rewarding experience
cant even start t xd big dude gun product refunded dlc price politics really go
one far best lot graphic atmosphere pure masterclass story endearing p pig fight diverse boss like
game design absolutely perfect
deserves title goty
adhd friendly review
stunning world character
level design could bit better many poi given instance
friendly bos design hard boss
amazing
gorgeous storytelling simple easy follow
fluid responsive
poor lighting lot area go darkness sudden flashbangs screen overall game amazing ceater ruined still fun
ultramar listen story like chill art direction go hard price pvp pve entertained hour time posting roughly worth blood golden throne skull skull god
gahahahaaoh hell naw titus tweakin
ca respect community almost august got brother playing game
much feat seemed dead set playing soul game
honest fan soul game either
rpg aspect gave enough hope give try
far cursed loud time care admit
get real embarassing living hotel work purpose come room people like hell man
brother summed game perfectly
skyrim insane difficulty
highest praise think given anything
picked game thinking like soul game
take heart
soul like aspect soul game
good rpg pretending soul took rpg took hand holding fetch quest ramped difficulty took away easy mode indicator oh level wait said ever want
would get close superior many game played recently
still funny graphical situation
thing like look tree much wind
look like giant duster moving randomly
though buy rpgs graphic alone expect modern rpgs modern graphic
real reason character world capable much better
sorry small including music well thought placed
normally turn music game right
game leave
music subtle almost add atmosphere rather distract
many time realise music died likely fight getting better still lesser last thing say disheartened die
happen
lose lot rune
game make git gud
time fallen enemy joy feel defeat
unmatched game ever played
feel like actually accomplished like rpgs especially old style hand held whole way buy game
may curse sleep enjoy
better waiting proper one
game clearly playtested run several game breaking bug hour example tabbing crash game always without resolution sometimes work sometimes doesntgame remember resolutionsui multiplayer stop respondingui scale change itselfon top performance worse second gamethe core gameplay seems interesting played enough really comment due issue encountered
literally restart game first hour play
far ive enjoying game
ive friend help bit seeing isnt usual game someone doesnt normally play open world game well outside day
caught pretty quickly far little help
also run perfect issue crash far ive enjoying
def rec trying
free reason
especially downside add yet
originally couldnt play multiple character changed quickly
im hoping people change negative review
dont believe game deserves
first game kind
getting trashed love every second
two week played hour game
would highly recommend anyone like creepy game survival game third person shooter mmos
game scratch many itch well
would recommend
come join u meta
edit release ie fixed one glaring problem game new warrior chaos rework load fun
release least stable relatively
therefore changing recommendation
se old buy game yet come back check current campaign riddled odd design decision bug could avoided looking warhammer second
example issue unit responsiveness missile targeting worked fine warhammer
performance campaign map way worse point one friend could even run damned thing warhammer ran perfectly fine
troy ran buttery smooth look slightly railroaded vortex campaign see nowhere near popular mortal empire campaign think solution must make new campaign even railroaded
would forgiven campaign side thing confident would soon get immortal empire combined campaign turn nowhere near completed
comitted releasing beta version
probably barely functioning version possibly late september god know long take full release
paid full price three time get combined map muster wait several month tell wait several month get beta test promised paid top dollar
change working promising needed implemented way slowly
really suck many good move game better diplomacy better siegemaps player campaign multiplayer simultaneous turn name
feel like playing campaign matter much
wish dlc team best luck warhammer sterling job warhammer post launch
great arpg probably one better goty candidate
overall experience let questionable control input mechanic less polished last describe game sentence black myth wukong reflection labour love reverence paid original chinese mythology journey west
throughout gameplay feel reverence detail devs put absolutely recommend game enjoyed seikiro devil may cry nioh series gow lord fallen nier automaton series etc
game build legacy others also proudly stand one memorable arpgs recent year thing black myth wukong carefully composed curated guided open world experience
option explore untrodden path eventually path lead back one
enhances game experience actually know background context chinese mythology journey black myth wukong take place original event journey west plenty liberal interpretation new world building based version monkey king
game best mid way fall flat rushed last chapter
many review talk polish game near end bad
look like placeholder pas though solid object like feeling rush finish distinct extremely jarring compared chapter game reward adaptive gameplay freely respec skill gear iteration learning bos mechanic failure exploration methodical slow play
game plot often interweaves side quest seemingly random encounter lot hidden information requires reading text via journal tab
english translation good overall story telling obfuscated full riddle adversely impacted translation need retain event memory bank connect fair amount dot throughout play
chapter whilst self contained overarching connected side quest world event even seemingly random picked item hold important core narrative lore add context
also numerous npc background story contribute different game outcome also help explain overall story
""
hidden zone chapter associated bos fight story directly tied end event chapter bringing fulfilling conclusion chapter arc whilst also hinting constant time shift mechanic employed game story issue game process player control input
issue general input lag game fails register input due animation lock input even animation seemingly completes
best example gourd use mostly able triggered even dodge attack
medicine
taking medicine requires player stand perfectly still player animation happening also game kid play mainly pc save file accidentally erased
version definitely playable including p portal via remote good story chinese voice better english nuance emotion conveyed keep english subtitle keep
enjoy game need cultural awareness listening aptitude essential want rely subtitle yet bulk context play game gathered text well
give overall story ymmv especially take time fully comprehend side story including bos lore tying together performance playing across range pc hardware including maxed setting including ray tracing high everything cinematic dlss
average uncommon dip peak around
laptop desktop pc currently action
also play legion go tried asus rog ally played fine setting yielding game without frame amd hardware afmf toggled via amd adrenaline software cause severe stuttering issue especially chapter
chapter also less performant chapter overall average fps dropping easily
traversal stutter game launch better technical state game played
game launch also playable actually enjoyable something taken granted modern aaa release
remember game science started devs started really recruiting people worked covid china never developed aaa level arpg game barely experience across team managed deliver product almost par like gow captivating world better overall graphic original story content variety depth first hour thoroughly enjoyed chapter
chapter far worst actually subpar aaa level due lack polish glitch enemy hitbox issue low fidelity asset boring level design bland copy paste create false sense scale due flying ability lore reading minimum character description scroll defeating one losing critical lore often interesting background
""
rat prince backstory read take maybe min max offer great insight act encounter made experience fulfilling defeating bos around game seem trending towards expensive game development less value offered customer missing content lack content even content locked behind day dlcs
includes game like jedi survivor starwars outlaw space marine show widely industry shifted favour monetisation core game value
often important diverse game appears npc rather diversity matter like actual human being worked project cultural representation etc
e g
people google english va paid worked black myth wukong even female play male deity type npc etc
diversity va cast dev team overshadowed ridiculous manufactured outrage either embellished social medium post year past outright defamation biased inaccurate gaming journalism gobbled swath public either misinformed people hate review bomb boycotting game without even game chinese developer vile seems
justification generalisation bias confirmation
devs harmed one making releasing game
buy game logic real life diversity cultural value great gameplay value money appeal
gameplay enjoyable level game still feel like player something still game dire need optimization though frame drop input delay get unbearable often run completely smooth hour unplayably laggy next server ping pc top line better recommended playing low made big difference run game steam launch parameter locking fps somehow odd really seem locked fps option lot could massively improve game solid core feel complete launch
year subjecting game trust generous term come conclusion debating whether group koala could better legitimate argument
forget comparing classic like c go game like comparing tricycle spraying bullet left right center missing every hit suddenly got team full russian offering extremely positive criticism
like tutorial play
thrill victory
oh boy wild ride
win match rewarded whopping elo point
lose
well say goodbye point faster say
let talk pc requirement
could pc cost small country gdp game still make perform like powered hamster wheel
lag
bug feature
let focus positive system masterpiece nothingness
chance face someone downloaded every cheat code known mankind
player hour
like gaming god smiting hour mere mortal every click enjoy subjecting digital torture highly recommend giving game try
like bad relationship toxic frustrating somehow ca quit
total warhammer impressive game
offer hundred hour entertainment
scope game simply staggering
warhammer fantasy world available sandbox campaign paint map diverse selection faction play uniquely campaign well battle
animation game fantastic unit nice attention detail part
truly fun great game
however fun great cost lack invest custodian team fix bug present bug ruin campaign nakai could recruit signature say truly going ca suspected higher ups giving devs enough support
hard recommend anyone get game predatory pricing especially recently amount dlc
end spending like dollar deep pocket care bug stand response ca suit get game
short version dark soul jumping horse
long version one depth game ever world detailed easily miss little secret dungeon
environment beautiful numerous time check time playing
gotten lost world exploring
soul vet already playing
fence give try easily one contender game year already march
pc issue yes stutter bad long driver updated record believe anyone saying beating game hour unless following guide skipping content make game special
reference completed everything limgrave beaten first major bos
explored little bit caelid red area east went south weeping peninsula
almost hour barely scratched surface game
think shes malenia blade miquella love grab arrack tracking
thought game july
overall think coming initial review game need initially quite annoyed coming fresh thing moment safely say gripe game solved
mechanical issue faced sorted
ror unit adding required spice game
intercept enemy mechanic added turning current campaign chore agreeable fun
balance unit fix aspect helped ton
example gorger went god mode decent ironguts actually hit tiny still one aspect need bit fixing chaos prince
direction ok quite underwhelming played
going start quoting legend man speaks see recommending game friend also leave initial review removing would unfair thought far may

elden ring release one influential international event year far
overall bmwukong amazing game
gorgeous graphic engaging mechanic character
encountered graphical bug lagging hour play possibly due hiccup connection laptop temperature
otherwise run well
constant infinite loading joining server cant play properly operation cause game pretty cool game fun
sadly hotfix release game constantly crash startup first warning screen
problem seems intel series work game currently tried everything fix
trust everything
even wrote game file long ca play game sadly get negativ found resolution
got ta install intel extreme tuning utility set performance core ratio
worked fine
finaly die emperor
becoming worse ever holding game hostage point recent statement shadow change price increase
sad game followed played long time
cant even express complete utter disappointment anymore lost faith game
guess wait around reasonable price buy dlc year even bother look ever game great dont buy deluxe editionthe adventure wo come pdfthe ost wo come flacthey come extract one one opening selecting itif want use artwork wallpaper screenshot losing lot qualitynot worth extra dollar review amended post patch continues special
ambitious dive storied varied setting
interest picking combine content fully developed expanded year aaa done visible tangible love people making game
pick trailer feel like made fan wargame bringing miniature battlefield life inside computer
stand total war warhammer alone offer ample content varied enjoyable piece content tied previous main game dlcs flcs simply make much grander
consider feature unit character release tied game always available ai meaning even anything beyond base game still present campaign likely hostile used still
project size feature many lot rough spot discrepancy bug piece content shape newest coolest
however given time developer change
episode game history made think would right thing changing better
sure significant bug still kicking around past total war warhammer release anniversary bewildering discouraging
anyone actually wondering game worth fancy ca recommend following trailer enough
kept hope bleakest time uncertain time video total war warhammer iii immortal empire launch trailer view immortal empire available total war warhammer iii player
immortal empire culmination entire total war warhammer series
old review outdated written prior patch announcement shadow change dlc special
ambitious dive storied varied setting
interest picking combine content fully developed expanded year aaa done visible tangible love people making game
pick trailer feel like made fan wargame bringing miniature battlefield life inside computer
however total war warhammer issue slowly diminish undermine ultimately degrade experience
talking purely bug technical issue come hand hand video game development
issue attitude responsibility viscious stand total war warhammer state absolutely requires patching polishing attention
however studio attitude towards patching actual fix reworks happen outside dlc release time part
feel publisher feel responsiblity regarding delivering finished working product point game bug making content inaccessible unplayable many month community mod able fix within day bug appearing
cause viscious cycle community hoping change fix revisiting various outdated part game left hanging next dlc might introduce patch thing being fixed inadvertently many others broken
despite believe player would agree game amazing experience journey
despite issue neglected year despite cycle staying true viscious always hope sometimes even delivered upon game becoming closer closer perfection complete broad fantasy strategy humongous announcement dlc shadow change killed hope
content excited everything else regarding price got massively increased compared previous dlc type lot content people asking hoping important general gameplay new faction missing reworks bug fix announced far feel lackluster even release date pushed back far could keeping previous announcement
happening top fact total war warhammer released sorry state took close year get thing somewhat decent shape many bug spelling mistake system could fixed judging modders work within week studio axe another one game middle game dlc cycle making community fearful happening game update dlcs longest time felt like right kind like old expansion pack passionate devs industry got swarmed pointless dlcs chopped content fomo crap horse armour
shadow change situation feel like might
trailer still amazing game still gem ca recommend title seemingly might receive care attention necessary properly polish finish round development
current sentiment stemming experience series attitude community general
love wrong change review proven wrong studio thing need change first
fix na c pls valve nobody read review drink beer every like get

мне все нравки значит игра топчик play total war warhammer ultra asus tuf upgraded ram gtx gpu amd cpu reason giving bad review ca even play total war warhammer medium graphic memory running low
clay model stand front screen begging end miserable life
legit want use low unit count low everything ca even run shadow lol warhammer need serious optimisation performance legit warhammer running like dream ultra looking pretty heck yet click warhammer everything look like half melted ignore memory tick box run like time looking worse warhammer product refunded got refund cause kept crashing upon launching minute
shame
looked promising matchmaking game invented autistic child ipad
product refunded great game fair warning arachnophobes
big spider game research buying ultimately returned due
handle others like bloodborne
join list skyrim hogwarts game wo play
though great game wish phobia could play really want deal spider
like even slightest
love one skull skull throne
understand people satisfied stuttering frame drop
however issue like stuttering honest easy look pas minor combat story environment level design music perfect
like would expect seem like put big bos monster tight limited dungeon space though
seems like copy pasting boss see similar bos usually bigger version dungeon counterpart personally still enjoy sekiro combat system combat system elden ring better dark soul alone would make want keep playing dr minor performance issue almost perfect everything else
graphic forget reality look long gameplay watch paint dry audio deaf audience grandma pc requirement check run rich ask nasa spare computer difficulty press easy learn hard significant brain dark soul grind nothing u care necessary average grind much need second life grinding story replace life game time long enough cup infinity beyond price free worth u spare money could also burn money bug never heard minor get ark survival game big terrarium bug
cyka blyat simulator exciting experience anyone enjoys solid challenge without hopelessness follow game
title certain aspect make familiar anyone experience genre wukong play like fast paced action bos run
ok guess comparison thief joy yes game like would probably given better rating due nature game one genre much less best impossible take reference point case much pain ca recommend poor performance dissapointing graphic start saying seems game greatly optimized pc even high end graphic seem oversharpened good general
pc suffer problem performance great even highest setting game look awful best way describe look way sharpened almost pixel looking close expensive pc want imagine run lower system
combat never clicked ambitious yet mastered nothing one pain selling point
combat initially seemed extremely fun much variety interesting idea however despite ambition try different thing never came together
lacked spark satisfaction game like sekiro lie p much want compare immediately noticeable take inspiration lot game one would think great going best since took everything made game shine bring single game
well good great taking much game mixing seems like forgot made game great every single one game excelled mastered something much forgot master end result okay combat reason leaf thinking something got ta missing even seems new feel lot like game played
average bos design tedious difficulty bos design could expected literally company meaning generic
interesting nothing made say wow
difficulty boss felt really easy others felt like complete chore adore difficult game sekiro dark soul sifu etc
name played generally found enjoyable way game unfortunately
found bos felt difficult like finally
reason always ended way sighing wanting soon possible something almost never happened game reason boss felt straight tedious even none took quarter time difficult boss game took factor made think way odd hitboxes big health pool odd hitboxes repetitive move oh forget
odd hitboxes dozen boss fought one stood tiger vanguard
progression reward felt meaningless one would thought going much grinding reward would amazing well think twice guy cause
lot reward given straight useless spark point given improve ability felt often changed nothing
single time feel powerful game neither get like zen mode feel like game clicked fight way without trouble finished sekiro know perfectly mean zen mode boss always changing finding way screw different
conclusion even trying play thing compare game felt like ambitious game promised much excelled nothing making impossible look back game took inspiration performance half cooked combat mediocre bos design tedious difficulty story telling care enough completely unenjoyable seemed like tried could guess depends kind game like play compare others similar genre really easy see lack
would wait
want early access game tag early access
good masterpiece tww ii level fun
buy
product received free emperor
dark soul game
probably pinnacle three total war warhammer game vast amount content since three game linked norsca first game
yeah play third game
warhammer fantasy like rts game must buy pretty much perfect game
go list issue game beside still strong recommendation issue huge map world map immortal empire continuation second game map already huge size improvement first game big enough conquer part whole map still feel finished said campaign
like love covering map rule supreme easily dive campaign still finish
played really finished one campaign fully achived short long victory full map campaign victory high game economy scale well
usually hit tier main building time start getting close short victory due bonus short long victory grant penalty large imperial taxation growth snowball end insane economic advantage end high eld campaign could probably lose army single turn really ar still value certain setup seem premiere good balanced army certain unit always case
clear minor thing auto resolve still better second game way better first game
take grain salt
perfect dream warhammer fan لعبة الأحلام لأي عاشق لعالم مطرقة الحرب black myth wukong arguably one best game played year
game gorgeous combat addictive fluid present decent challenge especially new game game similar nature
however game sometimes feel like leaving black myth wukong based classic chinese novel journey west expected bit comprehensive story
many story beat often left unexplained leave player dark wanting know
always bad thing personally felt important story beat felt underwhelming due unexplained
despite fairly simple put piece together quite literally understand purpose destined one
chapter culminates animation amazing key character ambition trial tribulation
certainly bright spot come storytelling
story left wanting know character
suppose invest original novel know mentioned combat black myth wukong incredible engaging easy understand
part thanks handy array transformation spell earn throughout game
truly amazing boss unique manage find way separate others
find stuck boss present decent challenge new journey
personally wish story related boss difficult
game also best fight sequence ever seen especially certain sequence related true ending
biggest part combat understand weapon skill correlation armor wearing especially late game
better understand easier fight
also important mention character skill leveled throughout game
said important acknowledge skill need skill
something really figure playing variety different skill truly enjoyed black myth wukong hope rumor devs planning trilogy true
certainly plan going back run collect handful achievement missed
people coming play game wake elden ring dlc certainly find good time
new player also find enjoying game
biggest recommendation people take time take world
handful boss quest missable careful enough
game take people thorough anywhere complete

term different majority modern game accept gacha wish machine used unlock blueprint powerful weapon gamble
two way receiving currency playing game available free battle pas tier
literally way exchange real money currency
earn claim bafflingif dislike game find fun performance issue connection problem
valid reason dislike bit actual review game nowthe game mindless masterpiece mean
combat slightly janky challenging
base building slight jank
enemy engaging damn game funif looking something turn brain need try hard looking sense solid consistent progression give game thing glorify game however
ability craft storage container base
enter building menu base build menu furnace weapon workbench etc
automatically pull resource storage crate territory
forgetting put copper bar metal scrap
accessible game also really good job drip feeding enjoyable content
play little bit get tired running everywhere hey quest unlock motorcycle fast travel
getting tired collecting wood charcoal
setup electricity eliminate need charcoal furnace
lot looting want spend little time base new system build defense wave enemy try attacking base nice reward
tired collecting wood ore want shoot stuff
unlock auto logger auto miner passively gather thing one thing give hope future game
lot attention detail innovative stuff come core survival game system seen unchanged many one criticism seeing pop seasonal reset stuff
turn totally fine everyone
people thinking end world need relax little
rust every month game came year ago
still consistently remains top active player steam day
devs said game keep blueprint reset arguably way time effort farm chopping tree hitting rock make
season reset material wood ore etc
moved thing called eternaland basically big private oasis invite friend separate main game
personal player housing wo using two month period trial run
bad feel next reset stuff get wiped
still motivated play
find two combat difficult downtime damn game free try decide
stop reading review
like like
okay big fan warhammer im really trying like slightly better rest race added roster

campaign ok multiplayer pointless without chat hard get game organize player sheck afk
waste alot time really crap decision get rid chat
completely ruined multiplayer
monke bam bam much anticipation finally chance delve black myth wukong
take visually stunning yet somewhat uneven art directionfrom moment step world black myth wukong hard impressed
game visual design nothing short extraordinary
character model environment special effect meticulously crafted reflecting deep respect chinese mythology
art direction capture otherworldly culturally authentic aspect source material
whether detailed texture grandeur set piece game feel like living breathing work art
clear developer poured heart exciting repetitivethe combat black myth wukong start exhilarating combining element modern action game like sekiro nioh
action variety ability transformation provide thrilling experience
however progress excitement begin wane
combat system becomes somewhat repetitive light attack combo used extensively
despite initial variety stance combo lack depth needed keep action fresh long stretch
bos fight though highlight
encounter feel unique sheer number boss impressive making battle game engaging design visually stunning lacking substancewhile game environment visually striking level design often fall short
chapter particular feel like barren wasteland desert snow area lack depth density
repetitive nature combat exacerbates issue turning exploration sometimes tedious task
shame visuals promise much actual level layout always atmospherethe story black myth wukong rooted rich folklore struggle stand
relies heavily mythological background without crafting compelling narrative
writing vague might leave player familiar source material feeling disconnected
however game atmosphere remains captivating driven strong mythical element
setting ambiance create immersive experience even story quite hit impressionsblack myth wukong game clear high noticeable low
visuals spectacular bos design atmosphere enchanting
yet repetitive combat lackluster level design story quite engage detract overall impact
good game fully realize potential
rate solid enjoyable experience room drawn visually stunning game engaging bos fight rich setting black myth wukong worth checking
prepared repetition along way
curator page monke review realm chaos patch still enjoyable expand empire due really obvious anti player bias ai patch fixed fixed issue discus still lesser degree
ai programmed expand empire avoids nearby enemy come straight
avoids direct field combat go around sacking settlement
whii campaign ai seemed logical aggressive trying expand going around sacking ca worried keeping legendary lord alive make confederation easier player ai way lord remain alive player encounter later part another faction
also grow faction leading meaningful war large faction
emperor game
mercy receive gift defy filth xeno mutant
life
pleasant surprise best described better version recent gow game small semblance soul tier quality production major bug least play
look amazing highest setting full ray tracing tho demanding however performance pretty good scale well lower game power fantasy way stronger boss feel great however one optional bos real contender one best boss gaming fight make work bit definitely going go people head think try understand character really
want feed story without effort understand meaningful downside huge amount invisible wall place seem like able go shadow erdtree even dlc would pick goty
luv emprahluv chaptahluv primarkluv racis like leandrossimple
like dark soul sneak around nasty enemy instead ragequitting minute final bos
game truly great extremely enjoyable
exploration top notch figuring lore cool
miss much stuff second playthrough stretch
said final bos fun sure isnt testing skill leading previous really strong good boss tho loses half star end still make one better game year game good doubt found game b hit mid game anything
fun thing become drag fight lot used boss fun fight understand could make every bos unique maybe enjoyable much invested beginning enjoyed technical problem locked fps really
ultrawide support know latter many ultrawide monitor included fps without using mod backwards engine using showing age aspect pc port good could
even death still serve game year live die repeatthe game masterpiece nothing say malenia cool bos
screenshot elden ring yamλto freeman god daaamn screenshot elden ring yamλto freeman let goooo screenshot elden ring yamλto freeman everything wrong modern gaming

emperor protects truly incredible game thing enjoy
pacing art style story everything absolute joy experience
may little repetitive enough variety combat enemy encounter keep fun
felt like landing hit like freight train whole campaign going enemy could hit back hard
also impressed ran budget gpu campaign starting dip towards end
mmm monke combat feel underwhelming shallow lot grind content bit thin ground
game fine paid battlepass paid cosmetic promise update later fine
democracy failed emperor
switched review positive light latest improvement still need talk thing
obvious leadership management issue baffling delivered solid product past
tw wh game series favorite strategy game time
think game top definitely put hundred hour
would ca management push terribly bad idea recipe success clear
competent people team listen listen total war community deliver great product everyone clear example bad decision new siege system introduced
made sense could admit mistake
eventually dialed back like regular siege
another example realm chaos campaign mostly unplayable eventually abandoned
never finished campaign important
game huge around playable faction race
race different faction often provide unique gameplay mechanic unit roster
play hundred hour still experience fraction game
getting base game dlcs already hefty investment wait sale best dlcs base game sale
one want commit time money game see game amazing good shape thanks total war community
get play let hope ca get stuff original review great game love
unfortunately seems ca management made series bad decision think ok make customer pay mistake
also think ok ban people speaking criticising
well
there game breaking bug porlogue
devs skill issue money matter
privilege
great game natural evolution franchise finally deserved game warhammer world pve fun
pvp fine
campaign well design
example campaign mission group space marine completing objective support main campaign
coop pve supporting squad
armor feel tanky feel like giga chadspace marine sigma malestrength brotherhoodno woman allowedbuy enjoyemperor protects usually really play open world game
dropped witcher skyrim dragon dogma sorry everyone really like go
felt kind done open world game big title way
still playing elden ring say probably best experience far playing video game
fromsoftware never dissapointed
considering creative assembly us engine game make excuse total war warhammer run half fps compared total war warhammer looking roughly
addition poorly optimized game inferior second game
cash grab finest
game essentially dollar entry ticket disgusting incestuous orgy ever conceived sociopath business degree
paradox could learn lesson want actually playable fun fleshed version game total cost easily including past game dlc
spend less time money planning trip disney world planning get full version know bought game including essentially waking en masse bout stockholm syndrome
wallet empty game unfun
make mistake
purchased game release day played three hour
absolute crap uninstalled forward one year friend recommended try
well got say game come long way vastly improved release game basically improved graphic mechanic
still need work many area current state game highly enjoyable worth mediocre price long time c player like beta game yet add friend list reminisce old day maybe throw copy way
coming back edit review many year later csgo gone free play improved lot year
glad see game still kicking strong
story supremely good wish day blood blood god though
animation seem like collision like
story amazing new map great faction fleshed
recommend fix majority performance issue stuttering crashing
run current gen game run elden ring barely get consistent fps higher
area even bos arena game drop like really ruin updatemajority performance stuff fixed great game thx highly recommend
also get seamless coop ur gon na coop cause better netcode somehow love game one major issue game come bet cant repair found big issue found ak bos already half broken havent found replacement yet
know could craft new ak near powerful one currently
please devs see make found repairable
game friend amazing graphic fight massive epic marine suit customize ability feel good bit repetitive enemy variety fun game tends despite game rather game
need tune unit responsiveness battle pathing
sick unit deciding contested ladder look much faster wide open unblocked gate
absolutely order unit run around circle purpose skipping entire shift clicked route decided actually going count completed
get completely deleted artillery
also still really fixed siege battle
wall tend kinda barren feel wrong still setting known extremely well defended city
would good fallback position something consistently viable across various walled map
ai also cheat given mechanical cheat like often allowed retreat zone ambush retreat zone exists outside map inaccessible
fun engaging skaven get paint purple watch cut limb reinforcement
engaging
great design
offensive ambush general bad mechanic zero counterplay aside good enough individual army win every battle watch completely meaningless unskippable second cutscene leader walking interesting deal another stupid rat ambush
performance honestly terrible
maxing high quite campaign map
campaign map zone edge border aliased corruption like ridiculous standard expect quality life third game
ragequitting b every session getting sick clawing every shred satisfaction
mention questionable notion campaign difficulty impacting auto resolve instead battle difficulty setting
surely auto resolve meant represent battle difficulty thereof control rather wanting diplomacy map blobbing economy challenging bug thing campaign quest battle spawn ca teleported
ai also appears play different movement rule kinda teleport behind fun engaging game march stance
also like nonsense double jeopardy battle assault lose immediately mechanically b defender unit get completely wiped break attacker unit make sense half time defender unit run enemy territory also nonsense keep retreat
chain nonsense quite yet game cause frequent bluescreens every ten hour playtime
game happens exactly click button
weird thing ca required first two game good chunk immortal empire content also still absolutely insists worth full aaa pricetag
hold mod improve
mod much cant anything unit mind ear full cotton
might well build monstrous infantry doomstack every unit behaves like also disables mod every time game update better write one reason fullscreen two three pixel short
hoping go away amount debugging troubleshooting actually made game strange bugged pixel lower left column along right
game including previous two game completely baffling
told sight mind fool task seeing seeing wise men turn mad saw
enemy emperor still draw breath peace
god war china ca getting greedy
sleeping big floofy cat literally improves sanity real though game issue definitely need work still lot fun current building pretty basic probably jank part game hope see variety improvement story interesting
fair seems like gameplay primary focus
design particularly unique one creative amazing first gameplay feel like mix rust division
thankfully pvp required
enjoy casual pve experience small instance pvp thrown via event occasionally wipe concern many definitely everyone think keep thing fresh allowing keep thing like currency skin blueprint etc main time sink
leveling gearing building fairly quick easy especially experience would consider negative
anything make game approachable new player start every writing monetization within game purely cosmetic
let hope stay free play game quite happy
looking forward future friend together give try losing nothing time
fun worth
samey combat get somewhat mundane
hope go combined arm route using etc
alternatively fleshing story meagre hour would also good way retain player interest
would say would get money worth game

even first battle beginning campaign take least min load big fight
started auto resolving everything mean lost slot fight
like give thumb fixed quite people game make past first cinematic
tried stuff people said online tell addressed developer yet
disappointing looking forward game
update review ever get fixed
recommend game due fact may unplayable intro cinematic crash fixed game still rampant crash
expect restart game every minute
game many strength unfortunately fails crucial aspect veteran intended difficulty fails delivering power fantasy mowing horde foe brutally destroying worthy foe consummate skill
armour generating mechanic work even horde enemy much damage often depleted immediately
health regen mechanic work constantly getting downed scrounging medicae pack spamming ultimate ability much possible get health back core game play loop
titus feel sluggish enemy bullet spongy
combat feel said huge warhammer fan loved graphic voice acting musical score atmosphere shame actual game play get love enough overlook flaw
never enjoyed soul game variety reason
generally enjoy game tend feel shallow unrewarding
yet greatly enjoy elden ring
like hour even finished game yet getting close
intention putting time soon well game ever played think successfully adapted soul core combat tough open world game always go explore level find new build find wall
thing suck hit da brick
world feel generally rewarding exploration filled way tweak build upgrade item heals genuinely tool disposal make game easier
ever feel like throwing wall probably

drop resolution fix
aside game buggy seen game breaking wise game highlight faction best point lore novel
one gripe textbook chaos antagonist short fought tyranids would loved see since biggest threat current main antagonist talkative made wish fought khorne faction instead even orcs since alot comical much entertaining
currently hoping new enemy season talkative bunch like orcs note guardsman pretty badass would love see new mission maybe different space marine chapter like imperial fist black game good fun holding line battle brother cadians make adrenaline run
lack dialogue opposing faction kinda dulls experience bit
already impressed less hour gameplay
fighting smooth scene stunning
optimization bad game
get steady laptop insanely beautiful graphic
真的很惊艳 best game ever see guy hit every shot run bullet turn around kill one shot damage dealt exit c okay gon na go everyone
game bad
issue cheater
since game became free cheater populated
main thing get ride cheater trust spam report report even cheating lot wo get banned flag false reporter toxic get kicked leave brand new steam accountdo play mirage overpass stick less played map like nuke

reason hour game due mod losing play game much got questionable design decision somethings addressed lot issue still radio silence developer help either nobody know situation addressed fugg vulkan life beginning creation game good competitive team later competitive mode mm battle cheater best cheat
creator game care player updated case
new operation bad updated disabling vac patrol
game officially bad never playing campaign really fun great gameplay stunning scenery wish impactful interaction pvp fun right well especially friend pvp especially quite bare bone moment map path unlocking new gear bit grindydespite complaint one favourite game year hope see continued update online elementsfor emperor
keep short like buy dlc making thing right allow beloved game die like ca greedy want even money feed pharoah hyena game make even close franchise made lower price loose money cow
p ok new dlc throne decay amazing ca great give dumbs coment shadow change still stay
game supper suck game incredibly fun play
home building combat decent exploration nailed allot feel game different game play failed arbitrary server wipe advertised game advertised promotional material leading launch
far good reason given server wipe player level playing field game largely pve pvp aspect make zero biggest negative thing game server wipe mechanic honestly character zero persistance beyond thing find make time invested game meaningless
massive time sink farming item finding item collecting energy credit leveling crafting item ect
wiped level farm item build better gun help farm item help build better waste time current design
hopefully future change offer server game mode character feel like wipe mechanic solves problem never existed cheep gimmick try finger hole monkee good would recommend totally love game
though flaw still beyond expectation
setting game sound display device screen prompt choose keyboard mousethere problem controller issue solved
product received free thx going recommend
stability issue yet
older architecture ram

sadly game barely gamebreaking bug remain predatory new dlc less content cost previous one feel like cash together public announcement necessary step financial reason posting record longest time tolerable
latest dlc half content roughly price ca recommend game anymore since buggy barely maintained enough
hope get another marine testament audacity love
insane think person shooter middle first obama administration famously killed studio touched getting sequel
equally insane game sculpted meticulous care reverence material legitimately bring millenium breathing screaming bloody life
space marine bleeds love source material bleeds competence almost every angle play space marine see might greatest squad based shooter element cooperated one another
reliably bully two people playing reasonably assured good time
game built ground impression coworkers able make quick intelligent decision obey order work perfect sync
space marine fantasy writ large small group transhuman warrior overcoming ravenous alien horde coordination brotherhood grotesque act
play game go obvious multiplayer point control point king hill protect npc bit imagine would like work two others equal world get
get two infamously terrible ai companion ever graced medium game make compromise
bring ai companion alone
carry every objective carry every important item need personally hold every point without human controller marine sometimes manage use gun successfully often abandon heart swarm chase ineffectually sniper
overstate enough game completely based around interlocking field fire ability trust people behind work synchronicity
trust companion keep swarm duel synapse creature death living space marine fantasy
ca die horribly miserably consistently

master duel get catch perfect parry perfect dodge respond time burst catastrophic damage invulnerable enemy die quickly badly

game close great far kinder much worse game experience badly hampered small mistake bring whole thing

playing game pullin pen blinker healing soul way therapy couldnt first first console wasnt friendly button took min first bos think im bad got ta dogphobia enjoyed far
get harder ill cry play good game really greedy company game tough brutal really visceral combat
love warhammer enjoyed first absolutely love second game
scale impressive feel like fighting huge zergs enemy play blast update playing campaign favourite game series buying dlcs since first game reason got gaming first place amazing journey year discovering warhammer fantasy world total wat game year content reasonable price perfect
game came along started bit meh realm chaos campaing best beareable
inmortal empire come free new dlc introduced insane ammount content multiple race little less regular race pack
point everything amazing game issue still franchise love put thousand hour chaos dwarf came
one less legendary lord usual exchange one legendary hereo
aswell came news usual free legendary lord accompanied dlc release going replaced legendary hero
important part price went euro
bad thought yeah one less legendary lord least got legendary heore race quite fun play
yeah get free legendary lord heroe nothing right
yeah gmae may little messy filled bug big game thing happen
fool
early augost shadow change dlc announced lord pack go introducing legendary lord featuring race
announce new legendary heore dlc would come new unit old lord pack usually came
well reality new unit beocuse one generic lord option one featured race old lord pack usually came one aswell maybe even one per race another one new generic heroe option nothing new last one legendary heroe last race old lord pack also included even legendary hero nothing new
change price revealed
increase exact
additional best increase content delivered
probably euro
feel extra greedy
tohught
even close
f cking euro
""
whaaat
""
joke
straight pitiful ammount additional content compared previous lord pack way shape form justify increase price
new dlc nowhere near much content previous race pack even one little overpriced love game want succeed want keep recieving content year come price
betrayed player base asking much little alll due greed
sadest part dlc dlc going foward
free legendary lord legenadry lord per race pack high quality euro lord love game want recomend really backstab
ca
real problem price mean greed overcome game thankfully position buy dlc could spend euro want probably would put docens houndreds hour dlc wont becouse money sending mesage
buy game dlcs wait
drug may best game ever made though might bit biased since love soulsborne much
combo best part fromsoft past game mashed one delicious full course seem lot people experiencing performance issue least rig tested game major issue stuttering nearly ever rtx gtx ti xeon gtx ram think might run well rig mean wait optimization patch always release one around month game release
love god worth review bombing especially game run like complete dogwater get rave review regardless
people want elden ring fail swear
ca ignoring historical fan nearly decade treating warhammer fan bad giving dlc ridiculous price less less corporation wont stop treating customer like unless stop supporting
save money manor lord buy pharaoh ca
time learn place
good lol ez skin ez win ez life nifty year old rt u crid understand wipe mechanic
much effort building craftings wiped
im still maidenless perfect game emperor sanguinius life
would binge total war warhammer latest game grand strategy franchise player command army containing thousand soldier real time battle also managing empire turn based world total war game played following previous warhammers shogun rome three kingdom troy
enjoy real world historical game warhammer game favourite variety provided different race help keep lengthy campaign interesting
immortal empiresi basing review immortal empire campaign map three warhammer game combined one giant world map featuring every faction appeared franchise
time spent playing grand cathay faction led zhao scale campaign incredible
eliminated faction cathay rebel skaven dark elf ogre nurgle chaos two faction vampire thought good idea declare war plus couple beastmen army raiding got alliance three neighbouring cathay faction
one defending great bastion reminds wall game throne chaos army north two expanded south land previously held lizardmen
helped keep border mostly secure allowing focus fighting u settlement earned short victory confederated ally close long victory
taken hour turn reach point often fighting multiple battle per turn
still faction map
western border high elf fighting skaven greenskins attempted invade empire twice
also defend north western border multiple attack another chaos faction led archaon everchosen final bos first game
meanwhile land far west even imagine long would take get large empire belonging tomb king dwarf wood elf slaanesh empire
hail mighty grand cathay
screenshot total war warhammer iii varied factionscathay playing style feel like typical total war campaign capturing settlement constructing building upgrade economy fund army extend empire
army good round mixture melee ranged cavalry unit
also unique send trade caravan capital city friendly western empire earn big profit
enemy army especially ogre mountain attack caravan pay attention harmony building general research event favour either yin yang
balanced get bonus income growth control public order unbalanced start get every turn choose direction set wu xing compass control wind magic
almost entirely positive thing let get bonus depending planning next turn
reduce recruitment cost want raise new army increase replenishment fighting lot battle increase income economy struggling increase control avoid rebellion reduce corruption capturing territory held vampire chaos faction also spent around hour playing skarbrand exile khorne whose tactic feel different
honest sure fully understand play starting success
army lack ranged unit focused strong melee cavalry biggest difference economy work
earn much money building unit expensive recruit feel like capturing territory waste time never able support enough army defend large think correct tactic couple army quickly rampaging around map one settlement next sacking earn enough money pay upkeep razing either earn skull needed research new tech spawn medium size temporary army free automatically disband turn give short term boost military cathay building expanding khorne focused destruction feel appropriate faction belonging blood god
illustrates different faction unit look unique offer varied playing experience provides lot replay far game crashed time suppose actually pretty good hour playing time campaign still labelled beta
noticed bug problem framerate
even though hundred faction army settlement map end turn process move quite visual design animation different unit really good
like appearance world map change based level corruption green grass tree scorched excellent game veteran total war player likely enjoy
scale immortal empire campaign easily worth full price purchase assuming already previous warhammer reaction game story campaign tried yet quite negative new player would probably fun starting warhammer strong story campaign
amazing game bos fight nut
wary finger hole fun game quite
highly recommended please add lamenter style cosmetic
cool game
seamless co op mod server elden ring server monke dark soul regardless fun around best game ever got cat passing touch click like pet
フ l ヽ ﾉ 二つ good expect game good polished combat variety build free infinite respec change combat style anytime want boss really unique well
surprisingly lot hidden secret side quest best part backtrack side quest even completing would nice exploration instead linear progression path personal preference
also chapter playtime completed pretty much everything game offer except maxing spirit equipment need get enough knot voidness spirit upgrade
like game give secret stance require lot work bad ca last long said definitely need new playthrough highly recommend trying get new stuff play
scaling onwards bit pretty much hit cap scaling scale harder make bit great game prob goty

confidently say game fan action rpgs chinese score combat story sheer joy exploration black myth wukong delivers front
game unforgettable journey stay long uncovered last secret
game damn fun friend
combat level design quite simple fairly hesitant purchase due people saying playable steam deck however got running consistent enough respectable
granted caused space marine godawful eyesight lot brutality beauty game lost run playable
many hacker toxic almost got people still cheating strike gaben isnt able pay functional anti cheat system speechless
absolutely love art direction game original style reference journey west refreshing game company focus game play story politics also breath fresh air often stale tech industry well done game science keeping real couple gripe playing game mentioned
inability replay cut scene
one chance see bos cut scene triggered bos always see bos spawned area found take little bit away ability keep story front centre game player experience usual way would replay cut scene time give player option skipping cut scene play want get straight action
many many many time game wandered open area find smack bang middle bos fight didnt anticipate didnt time buff didnt idea going bos bit problem time mean definitely bos might health manna focus forced bos scene ability actually prepare beat bos
cut scene bos kill scene found often jerky transition smoothly would assume technical problem way handle going rendered video playback real time action
npc enemy often replenish health run area spawn still see
many time ive almost taken tough enemy run away heal order able finish find return far away enemy beat sliver hp totally replenished hp make game bit annoying wonder anyone else experienced minor ui issue
wind spell fire protection buff assigned left stick rt basically mean time moving move left stick likely trigger move trying trigger spell default moving hold rt trigger spell like imobilize instead end using wind charm first would better assign left bumper seems assigned nothing
half way chapter really enjoy game apart technical quirk could improved better game play experience
respect game science creating completely unique world game player immerse story enjoy overcoming challenging rewarding boss enemy alike would definitely recommend anyone like kind game soulslike initial experience chinese proficient art line music particularly shocking
watch english clip online believe translation also pretty good
though read speak chinese line unrivaled video game history
flaunt exaggeration something probably truth
notable flaw path design reminds team ninja work love ninja game lol apart detail largest action game history video game date
reason giving try gamer
run like warhammer
poop every ai friend chaos faction
working reason bought game big part
sit infinite loading screen
tried every tip trick get working still fell short
trying verse mode load others get server unavailable prompt
hour content played hard difficulty setting could probably beat day easy watch update
hopefully add extra mission side content buy till

die try hog rider card unlocked spell valley arena
fast melee troop moderately high hitpoints damage

hog rider card cost elixir fast move speed boost forward mini tank like ice golem push
time also function tank lower hitpoint troop goblin still fair amount health
cheap swarm complement hog rider well nearly fast usually force one card opponent hog rider struggle swarm damage defeat quickly obstructing path
barbarian particular fully counter without strict timing defender part though wary hunter kill hog rider hit placed right top
however place something front hog rider hunter splash damage hog rider hit card front hog rider conjunction freeze surprise opponent allow hog rider deal much damage anticipated especially opponent counter swarm swarm effective counter
skeleton bat immediately defeated spell spear goblin goblin minion low enough health defeated follow zap giant strategy effective building hog rider take destroy building giving opponent ample time articulate another troop deal lot damage freeze time allow opponent set massive counterpush
reason player either go hog rider freeze unit backing counterattack match end need deal much damage good idea send hog rider simply destroy building especially building targeting unit available defeating crown tower becomes substantially difficult
spell simply waiting lifetime building effective
exception elixir collector placed front king tower
hog rider placed bridge destroy collector positive elixir trade though damage princess tower usually mean survive deal damage
however opponent sends defending troop opportunity gain spell damage deck several card might worth simply send hog rider one building
deck shuffle card rotation quick enough arrive next hog rider next building arrives opponent card troop like musketeer flying machine snipe building preserving hog rider health possibly allowing get tower building placed middle counter hog rider understanding placement hog rider type building placed help hog rider bypass certain building spawner elixir collector larger hitbox defensive building mean passive building placed tile away river middle opponent side impossible hog rider bypass placement hog rider get pulled building smaller hitbox passive building mean defensive building placed three tile away river middle opponent side hog rider placed left right side arena may able bypass due smaller player building already placed center arena opponent try bypass hog rider edge arena use certain air troop push hog rider towards building jump river effectively denying bypass attempt
must already hovering correct placement quick reflex required correctly perform bat skeleton dragon minion horde placed right front hog rider soon minion skeleton barrel mega minion flying machine electro dragon baby dragon inferno dragon balloon lava hound stagger placement one tile right hog rider placed left side arena vice also use ground troop achieve result
something like ice golem deployed hog rider landing spot obstruct path force go around unit cause closer building instead crown hog rider kite fast targeting troop due fast speed building targeting placed fourth tile bridge slightly opposite lane
also stall grounded unit placed right bridge
pull towards deploying untargetable jump bridge
landing pull back
useful player need deal damage lane defending
also help separate troop behind tank large tornado placed second tile front player king tower staggered two tile towards princess tower activate without damage dealt princess tower helping defending future push
also method mitigating damage dealt princess tower three time may result king tower health low enough targeted directly opening possible threat back door three crown
better alternative pull hog away princess tower attacking range three crown tower negate damage long none already distracteda powerful combo hog rider musketeer valkyrie typically referred trifecta
musketeer defend troop valkyrie protect hog rider swarm high damage unit
hog rider used deal damage effectively countered lightning musketeer severely damaging valkyrie hog rider
minion horde also effective enemy zap musketeer
even musketeer defeated hog rider valkyrie enough time severely damage hog rider placed behind valkyrie give boost stay front hog rider protecting hog rider combined goblin barrel awkward opponent defend
timing hog rider tanking tower shot goblin effective way deal damage
however barbarian barrel shut minimal tower damage positive elixir trade long goblin barrel placed directly tower

friend finally came losing vertigo magic cringe compared first game real disappointment
campaign thus far solid completed yet coop campaign true single player choice strange number coop single player two bot
heard campaign short eternal war hand
three map eternal war control point map changing game mode let play really bad deathmatch map clearly designed control point control point moved spot every second gamemode
spawn spawn location team switch spawn point periodically match real rhyme reason
spawn immediately get killed spawn point switched enemy team member spawned behind
map also much smaller first game instead gameplay
dreadnought game mode design note pvp seem begin end halo infinite make worse
khorne marine even inexplicable grappling tried first mission figured good single player good
gone horde tyranids instead walking clearing clearing fighting pack three five tyranid warrior
assault marine jump pack nerfed point uselessness map designed enjoy one piece equipment working nothing like game top chaos marine pvp get next customization option
assault marine night lord night lord painted red
reward really get pvp unlocking new colour customization option might well even exist queue decides put chaos big disappointment probably going reinstall space marine wait patch short total rework doubt pvp salvageable
game amazing
sadly pay twice get content involved
""
much
game great though like strategy
played game hour uninstalled
gameplay changed felt campaign quite rushed
game forcing make rash quick decision sequence happen
sequel
period

one best action game ever made
recommend enough
missed game played game
absurd skill tree open world b pure game
missed
know warhammer worry
need know anything
would recommend watching short recap first game direct sequel
would recommend first two warhammer title since ca access immortal empire without
base warhammer overpriced give like normal total war title way global domination race objective ai easier objective thing
immortal empire main game mode use playing total war title full domination
run lot better warhammer since playable
monthly patch balancing multiplayer feature game mode trying hard make thing spoiler wo
wish ca would drop competitive multiplayer scene mode focus everyone wanted first place immortal empire whatever learn way relic
ca tell immortal empire actual game rating went mostly negative positive
indicator fanbase want one thing guess nothing
sure ca sell positive review game mode try promote still anyway
spent hour game since launch got level everything going really well

nobody read review eat tablespoon ketchup every like game paid get angry depressed day second happiness beating bos yet im masochist goty embrace monkey game became one favourite time happy getting appreciation deserves peaked million player
truly unique ignore whatever journalist saying game diversity shown one care
game based chinese fantasy novel west matter
people talk actual game masterpiece say least
boss fun unique cool animation special design
cutscenes intro boss phenomenal
skill mechanic game amazing seen game
scenery absolutely gorgeous everything game literally unique word explain
genre mix say action rpg
personally performance issue would say really well science really outdid first big game like first game ca wait see store u future
let think future enjoy masterpiece everyday see gem like come
find anything else cause smile good reason
fun game even though game dlc feel bit expensive get
titus deez nutz emperor

much love artist programmer game tester engineer level designer writer animator love marketer people top
taking fantastic series using every scummy tactic squeeze much money possible mistake without accountability every team consists russian guy speaks year old kid slept mother anyone never played fromsoftware game
prefer combat environment variety weapon skill elden ring way go
hand want relaxing want less punishing game elden ring may afraid elden ring hard
like challenge many thing make process easier
elden ring heavily high punishing game
course story lore etc people come elden ring dr try like want variety build play want game high punish ezyou try want prefer enjoying environment want relax gameplay challenging trying game workshop pricing model see
bold strategy cotton let see work em old school c player disappointed see game evolve downwards year
giving multiple chance grow matter radiate vibe predecessor
nostalgia taking wheel find ton thing made c cs great wrongly implemented go
game main focus skin revenue last year anyone think otherwise sure live thick little bubble
competitive matchmaking system new weapon therefore strats learn russian development focused aesthetic terrible matchmaking balance hit registration hitbox feel like lack custom skin mod see awful one played game made valve downhill
right discus entitlement earn playing game enough said elden ring game fromsoftware product one aspect another clear elden ring smooth sekiro boss like dark soul story good bloodborne looking way anything make sense simply order salad subway put one star review saying refused sell ring lore still fresh vaatividya still work lore far barely piece together coherent explanation happened set foot land
offer similarity idea dark soul used open speculation story game thrown fractured world hundred year shattering war demigod came victorious leaving land stalemate
tarnished stripped grace greater exiled coming back land resurrected yet guided grace stripped one goal become elden elden summarize big land say always ring world made five main part surface level already sound like enormous place
wait part legacy dungeon big structure player get lost hour still surprised revisiting place
also catacomb minor erdtrees ruin village
densely packed give hour upon hour additional content go
still enough
literally major underground location bigger last one
dessert whole legacy dungeon floating sea near coastline land big pleasant look
answer go back look last two game made fromsoftware sekiro dark soul precisely fountainhead palace irithyll boreal valley
fromsoftware seems like dragging player countless swamp catacomb difficult boss whatnot build hatred towards another location might need go finish game every negative emotion leaf body presented called best area game aesthetically case irithyll case fountainhead palace case nearly every legacy dungeon elden ring
progressing world game like going best location one soul game another best location different game
think also beauty elevation elden ring exceptional job
land flat constantly changing elevation progress game main part map also location part
fromsoftware creates dark fantasy personally think currently one industry better elden important part especially advertised action rpg
reminder tarnished nobody simple task become elden lord various demigod stick wooden shield
game easy
hardest fromsoftware game still hard especially expect
dying lot
elden ring like game difficulty slider one difficulty get gud
fortunately tarnished elden ring provides lot different mechanic ease pain magic summons broken status buildup bleed cold cheesing last least pc modding
already mod change difficulty lowering health attack damage nearly everything elden ring
experience game best way though go learn fight optimize build try better feeling fromsoftware game beating hard bos get bored
think chance get bored game even simple combat mechanic also variety build easily probably even weapon armor set fresh elden bling many configuration new addition ash war
enough let talk variety enemy
remember seeing total enemy god war winner game year
unique enemy type game vastly different except reskins many though
also rat back madness status make life even miserable
actually lot enemy hate passion go reddit vent see vast majority player also hate malenia blade ashina hasitation game rightful choice game year
alexis good
spell miracle game look awesome nglcons bos fight suck
many shot move
good design lazy cheap
cant tell git gud vigor bos still shot previous fromsoft game played sekiro slave knight gael twin prince isshin owl many
great end day want satisfaction defeat boss
dont feel anything beat boss gameupdated played beat infamous malenia
holy
bos move fast belong soul game
like face sekiro bos move like normal soul attempt dual boss yes looking godskin duo reference demon prince smough ornstein headless ape
good dual boss bos aggressive one still attack slower pace
meanwhile dual boss game boss attacking aggressively time
yes harder
fair
overall review still standsoverall masterpiece game constantly crash
worth purchase current state
unplayable infinite loading crash often love total war best one
intro looked good without ultrawide hdr support game look limited washed
continue ready
would recomment wait better price final product especially uwqhd screen
product received free fun elder gamer fast response
enjoyed soul like game purchased one recommendation friend
bit worried purchasing game
however far enjoyed game offer beautify graphic amazing audio story timeline journey west may bit hard follow
issue since good knowledge around journey fight epic challenging feeling impossible
feeling difficulty boss linearly increased
spent lot time one boss beginning following one felt much general recommend black myth wukong anyone
switching positive
ca made big stride bug fixing amount content put dlcs
throne decay night day compared shadow change ton free content side
bug around year
pursuing routing unit wonky range los working artillery spreading shot etc fixed
price point dlc still quite high longer applied broken game get negative review loved trilogy well hour game ca burnt goodwill glacial pace low quality patching
basic feature reported multiple time year left unaddressed ignored
community bugfixes changed one line code fixed problem ca done lord pack pricing moving similar amount content banana
justifiable reason level price hike especially considering poor support received lifecycle
someone happily paid increased price chaos two problem get addressed possibly move thumb right unacceptable
product received free game world
graphic amazing
build style great
customization character upgrading weapon perfect
completely amazing open world survival game everyone definitely give try
start playing early good stuff come
third game trilogy game
create new game engine improve graphic major way didnt deal creating entirely brand new game mechanic
take learned previous two game create new content game engine
somehow year development managed thoroughly disgrace month release total war warhammer average concurrent player game
yikes throne decay recommend game friend
hopefully ca keep fast patch good dlc game still much offer
product received free great game ruined cheater point playing everything get wipe every month great fps ruined hacker devs give crap pretty skin make money
greed greed rat man yes yesdlc pay pay game good cosmetic expensive like skin way much
using lenovo legion laptop ti cpu two run flawless however stuttering god awful release
said game heroin controller needle
addicted worth buy
edit original edit save tldr throne decay released ca proved release good dlcs still
worth
would say yes
price still high overall
would also say empire dwarf got reworks needed new fun mechanic
dlcs big patch bring
hopefully new start ca warhammer
original soc review stay wo forgotten hold ca higher standard whatever launch soc love series warhammer total war series general
playing back rome borrowed disc crazy know friend fell love series
followed warhammer
know anything world warhammer fantasy like many aspect
real reason review
actually review time writing written war warhammer also known total warhammer game want suggest everyone
ca making really hard every step stair make seems follow falling flight made
game rough state need proper care mainline series get
know golden goose
seems treating like middle amounting game need help
content feed
game immortal empire ie since lot people care realm chaos terrible state need community patch even playable instance
gameplay bug maybe calling feature
able recruit kroxigors paid dlc lord warhammer impossible champion chaos lord also paid dlc upgrade daemon exalted many unit almost faction get benefit red line buff even though stated monster hunt still unit fire say obstructed run right enemy even though line sight perfectly clearand many many many bug
ever wanted see many fixed community continue play game love go see big community bug fix mod workshop
though still playing likely installed anyways
fixed mod complain
ca let fester get bad
putting resource game making money need recent dlc pricing desperately dlc pricing buck usd
really
lord different faction small amount unit split faction
ca think shadow change really level chaos dwarf
even overly priced race pack
old break lord lord faction dlc new reworked mechanicsroughly new unit new generic lord type per factionnew regiment renown unit ranging per factionand maybe flc lord might unique way playing legendary buck usd race legendary generic lord type set magicscompletely new faction unique mechanic unit roster built ground upall roughly buck usd shadow legendary lord one kislev cathay tzeentch unit kislev tzeentch cathay push
legendary hero generic hero generic lord cathayand ror unit kislev tzeentch cathay buck usd
really need price increase one lord pack
champion chaos dlc buck came four legendary lord ton new unit
yes reskins fine since unit different flavor chaos
sure people would able stomach even though really aught getting offered shadow change even say ca better
sure many many people play game want better
wo say stop shoveling money hyena even though fanbase probably wo care game please give total warhammer money attention deserves please stop trying nickle dime u
given lot rope rope getting real short real fast
especially bartholomew said
smarter wo giving money people threaten u
yo father probably one oldest people playing game
single father son
son got game christmas uncle installed computer started playing
end week hour game
horrible already hard find way spend time son always friend watching youtube
decided make steam account get game see could maybe play alongside
loaded game picked character world started playing stuck supposed
asked son help hosted game join
loved best time spent son since wife died
game ever since brought son closer actually spend time together outside house together well
game reminded fun everything brought son many happy memory
quite strange invisible wall problem make crazy
map lack easy identified object path finding
performance surprisingly good game unwelcome resource hog rest pc becomes noticeably sound great overall design voice character especially like attention small detail like background conversation combat take getting used start flowing much better campaign lot fun pvp pve mission
tl dr rating rarely get urge platinum game devs gave u secret bos fight became game worthy review wukong chapter start fairly linear map straight forward fun boss get impression chapter start open
chapter massive ante keep picking till someone played soul game lot face issue boss term difficulty boss good challenge
wukong focus mainly level design enemy design variety
exceeds expectation
every chapter end animated short clip
clip astonishingly well made deserves special
enemy variety design many enemy boss game none really copy paste boss except frog even different elemental effect
storytelling based existing lore
spectacularly done
quest design also quite fun
exploring well hard miss
level design chapter fairly straightforward linear
chapter massive sprawling interconnected level
fun explore
chapter basically big circle boss spread around
secret optional boss good level challenge
one fight extremely special easily fun year
jawdropping
get platinum run must weapon unlock component craft piece armor also available
still fine since speedrun take hour
annoying thing obtain certain item need either get lucky farm single enemy hour
waste nearly hour killing enemy get thunderflame seal curio tiger tendon belt curio
know drop rate item terrible
shame practice game company lean away
suck fun thing mindlessly run loop killing enemy hoping get item
area map look like easily dropped explored invisible wall
kind immersion
technical issue lot people texture popins lighting imbalance etc
got lucky get major technical issue
face lighting glitch
english voice acting as
especially sun wukong
thankfully character ddoes speak game
part wukong speaks intro end chapter cutscenes
chinese voice acting hand sound exceptionally good major issue game tbh
fun game overall
especially coming studio first major release game science done spectacular job
hopefully come level quality
terrible business practice general creative assembly sega
average game marred terrible monetization dlc model
worth plan actually buy dlc
basically stating buy game going maintenance mode
want
add insult injury also upped price dlc quality quantity content keep going greed awful monetization pair could care less actual quality game player feedback
rather make decision order turn quick profit watch playerbase limited goodwill accrued year come crumbling
piss brain excited game
supposed ultimate total war ca abandoned product spat face form ca wont buying
emperor
举头望明月低头思故乡 c rip played small penis girlfriend live
none thing changed game pretty good got perma banned grinding zone much acid
wasted hour life able play anymore
seems little silly good
sure grind much future player
keen would rather spend real money instead time
think work
think love making
think reading
everywhere
game impact greatly enlarged brain equal part dopamine rage
nothing else say buying game make elden brain
good
hacker feature
big head guy f

love game
revolver update amung global gun nerf ruined game forcing shorter round time bomb timer havnt touched shoot foot valve give damn
""
game core loop crafting combat
crafting feel like chore combat underwhelming
melee animation varied really interesting act shooting pretty graphic pretty nice
high quality reason reminds korean animation sure vibe get
performance solid give shot
might like enjoying gameplay even though playing know hour game might get better hour willing wait
case front loaded good stuff instead constant tutorial hour
game badass
old school badass
thank justice saber
leik flashbback good old time gaming
great atmopshere straight story like forced thing time constraint wait mortal empire come modding
right bad chaos realm chaos portal mean conquering new area give huge area defend chaos army appear middle back line
need hunt portal close assassinate hero spreading corruption kill army settlement battle annoying fight
""
play ai never want fight open
every battle settlement battle
unit pathing settlement battle make rage
troop get stuck single file conga line degree corner
get practice micro management go
worthy successor first game gameplay feel tight get hang look clearly made team familiar passionate source run smoothly end machine max server bit jittery affected badly
ignore fake post people trying start fight
real lgbt playersas gay gamer year find game well done
visuals performance also buddhist source material enjoyed well
worth play set setting within spec
note high cinema work set dlss time farm spark start cicada scene pay
skill chainsthe game character descendant consciousness wukong
need change
story
perfiction faith ca
right discus entitlement earn playing game ca pr department launch perfect update destroyed game also pay extra blood pack wich outrageous buy game lowkey fun asf though super earth lost carry emperor
would give opinion game according creative assembly discussion game privilige right
overpriced value
dlc policy lack bugfixes make hard recommend
previous game better experience
good game kill enemy man fall matter xenos heretic renegade die
sun wukong favorite character mythology
loved watching journey west kid remember masterpiece deeply
far game developer made game based journey west
game science first chinese game developer dare make symbolic work
really amazing
matter style work reflects look forward buy every platform
also hope break chinese game direction design fixed game balance fixed patch ca stop playing day night addictive
goty achievement 孙悟空是神话里面我最喜欢的角色 游戏科学 不能修复 游戏平衡 补丁可以修复 好玩到停不下来 每天早晚都在玩 全成就三周目 absolutely love game much fun play friend
would absolutely recommend leave cat everybody pass pet give thumb award フ l ヽ ﾉ give skeleton good inferior warhammer every way except diplomacy
campaign terribly tuned almost never get field deploy army way want
map feel claustrophobic due lack reward relative risk come expansion leading endgame faction might control region army
tiny unit roster uninspired faction mechanic etc others covered really disappointing effort seeming cash grab fence whether recommend game realized need think recommend
still black myth wukong close getting recommendation game recommend worth anything
snag sale worth price
also important support game like stellar blade show country known producing solid game
limit leeway allow
wukong close solid game
sadly continued playing less less fun
maybe expectation high developer first real video game
maybe expected jank issue game
game present level aaa title maybe completely unfair expectation high wukong
game start strong wukong talking insane amount trash literally massive celestial court
""
ready board character
ready story could grow brash character across long journey
wukong intro enjoyable punch mouth got stuck mute monkey personality character charm
looking back think destined one probably meant character project onto
fine good sadly monkey swinging around staff last time checked fell little flat
start put disappointed mindset
help feel like would better include glorified cutscene toward end game instead leaving player jarring character shift right start story
fact lot character fun watch make destined one complete lack character even annoying deal story progress
get writing character focal point long story hard come based one iconic piece chinese literature world
something mute monkey could done
fact despite based one iconic piece chinese literature ever story much
concede might entirely unfamiliar journey west think forgiven expecting standalone game tell story
second third fourth game series
sure knowing going
putting firm grip narrative instance story dump come form music video dropping middle area biome
mighty biome mind
granted kind better pretty screenshots instead practical intuitive level design
chapter area big
felt like spending time running around trying hunt secret since wanted get much game possible became annoying
granted appreciate developer put huge area missable secret game cool help future critical path stuff
make worth player time effort engage side content world bloated game like assassin creed star war outlaw side content worth engaging huge plus
still level design became almost unbearable chapter trying spot small area flying around cloud looked bad belonged game
know made pretty environment
pretty indeed
please make inevitable sequel game trim fat make area smaller add better indicator pile rubble worth climbing let people focus best part game combat
combat best part visually impressive set baggage
robust set skill tree really build wukong plenty option shake play style
probably many skill tree option unlike path exile looking wukong skill tree make want puke
low bar clear clear wukong
biggest issue combat work half time
idea worked game long hanging hat combat somehow aerial heavy attack connect
insane many time would walk stationary enemy jump air use heavy attack hit connect
game spent year development
issue hitting aerial heavy attack game decided take nap job
enemy hitboxes hurtboxes general good
many attack would miss enemy bigger apartment wiggled inch left
course rule apply
interest fairness destined one decided expand hurtbox twice normal size either side
exception rock game
enemy attack often conveniently miss rock solid form
rock solid one first spell wo work half time
bug use immobilize spell bos work bos hit anyway spell cooldown
giving developer benefit doubt saying bug intentional game design immobilize spell immobilize used inexcusable
even spell work chunk boss let use
use immobilize essentially plot armor kick say get use spell
nope matter many point invested spell
get use bos game say
top bos fight horrendously designed tipping point making realize game fun
despite game getting easier went thanks upgrade devs made sure study manus father abyss make sure got spastic flailing right
least worst single attack boss arsenal lost mystical art random fps loong erlang two bos fight exceptionally bad making sure stocked elden ring flailing combo along plenty poise trait shared normal enemy reason ensure got annoying possible
decide much fun got play game much make sure take air year letting contemplate sin winning hard
know
perhaps line game theme
disappointingly wukong game numerous small irritation surround core something could much better
game take around hour complete much content possible numerous small irritation start mount pile point game best purchased sale least issue get ironed
please return csgo
game sucksedit getting better
thanks devs year dont know pro player game suka blyat simulator like warhammer feel warhammer huge let term roster variety campaign mechanic could choose ignore vortex play game warhammer punishing playing game way way ca want hopefully flesh roster fix campaign flaw better still add immortal empire cant reccomend current state
game wasnt ready release show immortal empire released game finally become enjoyable enough rate
blood blood god
skull skull throne fun emperor provides graphic forget reality look long gameplay watch paint dry audio deaf audience grandma pc requirement check run rich ask nasa spare computer game size floppy old eat hard want entire hard drive hold need invest black hole hold data difficulty press significant brain dark soul grind u care necessary average grind much need second life grinding story replace life game time long enough cup monke price free worth u spare money could also burn money bug never heard get ark survival game big terrarium bug

playtime length long finish game depends mastered enemy give hour complete story total hour want get game completion full achievement

wow
gamemode overlapping main story customisation progression space marine playable class pvpsummaryone game worth game could learn thing two story fun hooked wish could forget replay mention miss first cutscenes due massive lag playback
issue occurr moving game ssd emperor
great certified elector count classic got ta say dissapointing game
totally boring unplayable random people take someone ton patience play
action limited requires lot boring camping accompish anything
need friend nothing better make game even bearable
worth money
excellent game
campaign non stop moment epic memorable scene packed densely laconian style blunt conversation phrase smell sweat screen character regains faith brotherhood
moment bored thought game padded fun way campaign
enhanced badass combat look like effortlessly cutting craziest monster rapid succession playing well getting face kicked
parrying doging gunstriking armor melee movesets provides much avenue swing big around without feeling like getting everything free even little enemy destroy go afk
basically forced regain health hit line gunstrikes execution regain armor protects health ranged
feel good everything parried stomped ground like tank inching forward mass enemy without feeling easy
like sekiro elden ring everyone moveset generous window make right choice
hope add health regain execution would make game feel like turn brain dead execution drone even understand gunstrikes ruin skill ceiling make gameplay feel pve coop mode alá darktide add whole bunch rpg mechanic play mission view point another squad
get dozen class level passive skill tree lot weapon variant even exist campaign getting full access customize armor even skill tree weapon
skill tree enough impact make feel like god progressing ie
regenerating health kill perk
provides enough complexity enjoyment feel like fresh experience right campaign much rpg element though skill ceiling gameplay rewarding could easily recommeded make easier
sometimes scratch bumhole sniff finger immortal empire insanely fun
sheer variety scale make far away best total war ever
enjoyable game played long time
remains true story warhammer universe
think might game today touched woke nonsense
giant killing machine gay space marine f around
attacked internet
think need support production today
let come gameplay combat mechanic good enjoyable especially fighting large horde fun
storytelling good think campaign duration quite sufficient
pve pvp mode enjoyable operation mode part liked ryzen graphic card normal setting often fall fps put lot load processor

viable ip might lord ring game throne modern warfare
need invest time whichever way choose go improve gameplay win back customer lost confidence
first changed dota completely
valve taking away game like giving something different return
maidenless easy lose mental health insane dlc price lately
well hi thanks stopping hour gameplay reaching lem rank consider expierenced player c thinking buying game might find review start
surely looking highly competetive game
compete player unlike example moba game winning always option
beacouse game personal skill thats important thing
game teach teamwork course scream son solo win every round goal game
solo que competetive put random game random people team random people enemy team
different nationaliy different character react thing differently
time game teammate best friend
supposed watch back coordinate tactic execute best situation winning round communicate much course bad day meet people speak language bad day well try grief loose game purpose
thats rare percentage personal experience
need always stay positive calm team come game mechanic
c go isnt complicated original compared fps game
aiming crosshair guy holding left mouse button like tomorrow still hitting
try chilling bit tapping mouse
dont run shoot stop aim fire
way go c
get frustrated lot curse throw screen window dont worry master game better feeling headshoting awper deagle trust mentioned deagle high variety weapon game
pistoles different certain situation
shotgun smgs rifle
even light machine gun
choose negev since worthless
always felt mlg quickscope power vein
buy awp power one shot kill unless hit leg
poor buy go tasty headshot
completely honest gun need master first place
managed learn spray pattern long range potential power one shot headshot compare rifle power well except negev deagle gun mainly play good go play
game mode
yes course
old popular arm race everyone shoot level gun end kill someone golden knife
get demolition
something like competetive allowed buy gun level instead every round get kill
deatchmatch practice warm reccomend starting game also get famous casual
full unranked new player sometimes bored globals mostly people playing c go fun gamemodes
seems boring
course plenty community server allowing play battle royale deathruns bhop server surf hide n seek zombie mode lot cool stuff havent managed discover wait game seems cool must catch
yes
dont know russian oh poor soul wish luck since yelled lot
also meet cheater obvious one spinbot around killing wall boost rank noob paying meet trying boost themselfes slight aim assistance bhop script barely noticable
rarely meet cheater regulary fulfill duty part
""
system implemented game allowing player watch demo game somebody got reported
person got reported pov see
completely anonymus also help catching people somehow avoid vac system
dont think get access easily take thing wanted mention skin
like csgo economy
money buy key key trade skin skin get skin
since skin must pro player right
thats silly skin used game cost joke
loose money opening case get kinky knife skin always wanted
dont get addicted since spent way money skin wanted
well forward playing
nice half hr boot intro screen slide show nice game goog tell simp without telling simp watching falter path even moment
show mercy little played release post immortal empire see game developing right hesitant get game release rest assured game vastly improved since especially sandbox campaign disliked chaos gate mechanic

xenos
heretic
filth
enemy next target practice
reload deliver repeat galaxy cleansed
combat pure undiluted rage made flesh
kill enemy annihilate every pull trigger emperor screaming purge harder ear
story simple human dy
need context reason xenos exist enough condemn
emperor fist galaxy punching bag
pro combat feel like emperor constantly alien head pop
graphic gothic aesthetic good might convert ecclesiarchy
seriously skull necron fashion show
immersion warhammer get
every word every bolt round every alien scream emperor soundtrack epic orchestral score make every fight feel like holy war
game might double manliness thanks intense action con keybindings might feel like designed heretic fear
adjust control precise space marine aim minor bug crash honestly probably nurgle trying mess game
purge system brother
tyranids scream enough smash
could use would obliterate xenos heretic screaming emperor crack cocaine soul game
game mostly linear bos rush
would say closest comparison would ninja enemy difficulty feel rightno penalty dyingcombat mechanic well designed easy understandwide variety skill spell item equipment let tailor play stylebeautiful environment overall visual styleanimations extremely detailed fluidsounds directional
hear enemy approaching behind firing arrow invisible barrier everywhere
hard tell allowed traverseenemy pathing janky often get stuck vertical rock facessome camera issue backed wall corneroverall rating buying full price brainer sale game buggy mess
mid low range card bug causing texture load character model invisible
unacceptable game like poor programming ca accommodate minimum requirement dont chance valve cheater private power cheat common cheat without cheat
game amazing far buy play cant wait workshop game
one favorite game ever played grabbed attention held iron grip
anytime figure wan na hard resist siren call elden exploration game absolutely treat really feel like discovery made every little nook cranny

nothing wrong privacy policy human
stop parroting twitter reddit read
obligatory return monke
game gave cancer good type cancer treat like competitive eventually get good game sick win worth still cancer doe ill eventually die horrible death least got sick scope yes really like game
lot fun
current state play warhammer wait mortal empire campaign released warhammer
like game opinion best game yet
open world dungeon location explore also level bottleneck opening next part story area feel keep flow particular place time never came across chest people talk encounter enemy everyone talk find chest people miss
kind wild different people go area totally different experience miss certain thing
game generous bonfire aka site grace surprising difficulty still feeling like first chapter start presenting later chapter player
health stats important ever time around
good point vigor get lot stuff keep mind tip sure bos yet want cross fog unwittingly put summon sign help people many time want learn bos pattern even get free along way
shame like dark soul way want brutal fantasy adventure yes recommend
currently tech issue know addressing pc exceeding spec might want wait moment aware turn setting
extremely easy game also hard either russian strike cheater offensive
honest rating
cheating smurfing
player russian since could afford game went
see russian either ducking mom cheating maybe
bet rogier get many maiden dark soul better fun sh game yet still dumb keep playing bc tf elden ring latest game developed fromsoftware company soul franchise
time fromsoftware took departure standard world approach game development
instead opted approach heavy reliance soul game mechanic
learned elden ring would developed soul game worried game would turn
however elden ring turned something far better vast world filled activity secret sidequests enemy boss entertain player hundred wonderful sense exploration unparalleled scope bos battle difficult yet extremely satisfying beautiful graphic show noticeable improvement older title dark soul great map system guide player right direction help search secret activity
wide variety weapon different ash war allows diverse intuitive efficient weapon upgrade system wide variety spell incantation talisman armor choose stellar design con performance issue framerate drop got better compared launch version still need work mostly fair overly difficult feel little cheap overall think elden ring masterpiece offer new possibility genre become somewhat stale recent year
similar breath wild five year ago elden ring prof genre evolve become something truly remarkable
disappointing fun
want grab discount
emperor forgive speak heresy recommend game surely ruinous power corrupted gift emperor
play like button masher fighting game press block button bright light icon flash press dodge button bright light flash
like third person fighting button masher genre looking shadow war weak little guy get interrupted repeatedly enemy making attack right enemy face chain sword enemy act poking face stick
compare game like bolt gun feel weight space marine feel like space marine game come like clunky third person button masher fighting game rather tactical third person shooter play role genetically engineered superhuman fighting horde xeno scum
game felt weaker enemy special xeno enemy usually spammed b move like third person button masher miss prompt uh oh go health
honestly game frustrating though scene beautiful atmosphere universe absolutely immersive overall amazing look game ca get beyond clunky combat system make feel like playing elden ring spam dodge roll away enemy bunch special group around basically dead
know whole able play favorite space marine chapter something seen much video game honestly pve mission moment pvp tacked seemingly last minute campaign absolute joke claiming
space marine sim
combination clunky control auto hitting enemy overpowered ability mid trash combat make feel like member astra militarium horus great bushy bum devs decide give tzeetch beastmen invulnerable shield really broken power attack
like giving every tyrannid grunt shield saying ah ah power attack amount time surrounded shield guy getting ripped apart thousand sun space marine distance power attack whole horde shielded enemy completely ridiculous
horde game want low level enemy easily killed focus high level enemy
instead turn mosh pit lose health focus power attack shield man keep hitting every single second
rush b stop game ok true gem assemble previous game dlc state completeness
love series likely go one time favorite
said recommend game assembly time left game breaking bug month upon month recently allowed critical part paid dlc kroxigors nakai hunter beast broken point essentially half dlc unplayable
worry still happy charge full price time
recent dlc massive price hike debateably less content
top freelc offer nowhere near benefit historically accompanied dlc devs artist amazing work create fantastic experience properly staffed funded recommend game essentially scaffolding hang great dlc dlc support failing deliver
game treated money pinata leadership company fund project recommend product creative assembly blatantly given least amount attention possible charging much want make sure clear recommend game dlc possible buy may get critically broken fixed month
even content worth price time excuse multiple instance content left broken month

monkey
game
elden ring elden ring begin one
fromsoftware journey demon soul way leaf u incredible foundation could considered best game yet utilising familiar soulsborne format spinning open world
game utterly jam packed thing discover fight oddball character weird esoteric story motif
game insane vision incredible finished hour expectation probably tempered
context time beaten almost every game fromsoftware modern lineup exception demon soul due owning
gone way seek greatest challenge bell run sekiro queen yharnam trophy bloodborne
elden ring start dissimilar dark soul seem incredibly familiar magic meter returning along split bar flask weapon art exchanged new system called ash war allowing chop change various skill variety mundane weapon creating entirely brand new playstyles strategy
magic stronger ever spell slot completely independent stat increase magic bar actively encouraging seek magic use
make game first stretch incredibly replayable experiment various ash spell weapon combination compliment
even better exploration first playthrough rewarded next skip surprising number boss encounter find strong equipment spell early use base new run
best character building game world never stop absolutely breathtaking look seems elden ring eventually buckle ambition attempt top came
game relatively challenging limgrave way past altus plateau leyndell royal capital skyrocket difficulty
recognising game somehow challenge dozen different player character build hundred potential ash war combination becomes might fromsoftware hardest game ever put code
difficult boss reused regular enemy impunity
input reading rampant gank boss common place enemy aggressive staggered combo extreme delay attack game play relatively slow dark soul character
lategame healthpools absolutely titanic difficult stance break even character high damage number begin struggle without help summons bleed frostbite especially bleed given status proc scale infinitely matter big healthbar open world format benefit hurt game almost good design runtime last two area gauntlet less five absolute hardest boss game
time done monster four could beat without help certain extremely strong spirit summon fatigued incredibly tired rather feeling accomplished
advice play dirty humanly possible struggling
life death battle hitch absolutely fantastic ending say elden ring still worth money time spare either
go expecting anything another dark soul time word switched around much bigger grand time
never played soul find game incredibly hard hard want destroy controller damn hard
course gamer usually review game biased nonsense ahem journalist made give honest review
amazing
wukong worth every penny
graphic great fee like anime protag jump complete certain move
reset skill point anytime shrine free allows play different style try
also bos hard go back beat mob get point get stronger
linear game path make feel like small open world time
great game play
bad part gen intell po chip reduce overclocking play without crashing
also set global lighting lower able see dark area sometimes black screen
crashing download intel xtreme utility reduce overclock modifier
reduce mine stopped crashing
happens every day acceptable
fun brutal game engaging combat improving game many wysbest warhammer game played since dow run well pc got wrecked frog wearing clothes fantastic game play fantastic graphic continuing fantastic story
really hope dlc game
pro graphic good
attempt made faithful lore
decent visuals combat good amount finisher gore satisfying upgrade system provides level gameplay clunky
space marine move like space marine rather like fallout power armor maybe even less agile
want different kind boltguns kinda suck
low ammo weapon
remember last little guy vermintide would damage fight
guy expensive gettingui cumbersome long press confirm window common control obviously made mostly decent job randomly glaring error
instance iron warrior main colour gold
commanding officer cadians accent different troop reason
speaking cadians done dirty
way capable holding line tyranids unless given plot armor
banter space marine probably something would occur either
flavor text wrong minotaur come mind
scaling
vehicle small csm big compared primaris
copy homework
sure change bit look different
game mode operation pve linear map objective map enemy
eternal war pvp interest playing
obviously tacked end
chaos doesnt cosmetic customization color
instance want green world eater
yellow deathguard
csm weapon even though reskins primaris equivalent absolute cancer
restricted taking class mission player pve must unique class
maybe primaris maybe gameplay choice
sure seems like random injection hero shooter something isnt
game gon na short lifespan
compared title released recently simply probably keep playing several friend request assistance get money worth
game gone sh ever since game gone free play amount hacker smurfs gone thru roof never made game free play made way get prime pay full amount game free play
dont ever rcommend play game unless better way ban hacker stop smurfs making new account elden ringlet start saying first game played created fromsoftware well except killing first bos really count
caught elden ring hype really interested game even release
even come mind even look thought would right game
oh boy mistake
month ago finally decided look game almost instantly decided get interested game start actually made enjoy much
hyped trailer medium rumor
went game clean slate
amazing
first time hearing awesome soundtrack menu exploring crazy world land let tell barely scratched surface world world really feel alive
crazy previous mostly linear game devs managed create impressive open world
map huge area feel empty place
location really feel different tell let say tedious location looking mountaintops giant get bit annoying playing game several time
nevertheless even depressing hill deserve special place gamer heart
wo mention location would sin spoil behind u let move onto people inhabiting land
npc player
make feel really alive never met guy
well certainly care thing anyways
crazy
world constantly evolving npc
people meet adventure interesting get
many time could certainly say okay npc good surely stay way
craziest thing might meet even half npc playing game sake reaching kick as bastard look cool
damn wish born cool bos
hey tough luck foul tarnished
get shiny gear kick as change
ambitious surely foolish margit goat ring unique ending
gon na say
though expect elden ring expert first tenth playthrough
lore fromsoft known hidden every possible way
get new weapon
thought lore disguise
got completely useless pot completely useless
oh wait got ten paragraph lore description
honestly really want know atleast bit lore interested certain character recommend look external source youtube video useful lore site
warned still numerous mystery even notorious loreheads still uncertain
hey beauty say think currently long time better entry point fromsoft game
even though elden ring still exactly help get still kick as every chance get fun as kicking
wholeheartedly recommend anyone even bit interested genre game might even time announce dlc reveal say fromsoft
pretty please tldr game year need add anything else
wait actually
waifus
fromsoft boy truly outdone
negative review herecy video game used feel like woke medium tried convince u needed political topic gender ideology lgbtq representation beloved form entertainment
listen people complaining game running
work perfectly fine even early access devs constantly fixing problem
go game trying enjoy soaking atmosphere tailored devs understand devs going anywhere
already blast
best game thus far
blue ball
blue boy edit changed dlc pricing something manageable changing back review recommend game
keeping original review easily change back recommended pull anything else like warhammer fix dlc price go back favorite game
seriously though thing wrong game cost latest dlc
look like introduced fun mechanic game sorry already faction added see skaven especially snikch tzeench daemon
community understand needing raise price future dlc making sudden hike previous cost nasty
chaos dwarf dlc price raise risky thought arguably worth new race still expensive let honest variation existing game race
moment cost dlc return reasonable level review changed recommend ca recommend favorite game anyone
someone also play sigmar table top take lot complain cost
emperor
many way die east
immortal empire added faction balancing fantastic
fantasy total war fan inception till middle finally gave shot
trilogy spanning campaign probably best total war experience ever made period
hope historical side eventually get samae treatment lot fun expensive justify point
buying whole new game every dlcs get whole worse developer response showing believe customer shut keep playing sometimes since already bought lot dlc wo buying previously recommended
would say done previous dlc added extra content free current dlc ton content reasonable amount changed mind
best part game gameplay graphic beautiful animated sequence art mural end chapter
part total war community show support game love
hope see many dlc update
imperial guardsman space marine inquisitor walk guardsman say ow
marine break right bar reinforced inquisitor accuses bar heresy
bar refuse confess even move despite sustained torture inquisitor executes guardsman failing defeat bar combat
challenging addictive thumb
game work
mid dlc except mesmer
gameplay race option prologue overall experience strategic game fun impressive
game beautiful immersive
rage quit kind hit turn chaos campaign mechanic kick go downhill
portal exciting realm fun thematic faction rush time preventing visiting realm experience feel long unfair least last battle drain fun
finished made fourth soul deciding worth finishing playthrough keep dropping earlier earlier playthrough tried
overall feel really fun game underneath campaign kill enjoyment
played immortal empire campaign review kinda stand feel ridiculously unbalanced one faction next tried many finding mix fun frustration
base game fun playing army trashing unprotectable smaller settlement sometimes ai uneven enjoyability different race mechanic make playing game frustrating experience
really know global offensive cost less source nevertheless great game successor real legend
little hard adapt come game like battlefield cod recoil sight dedicated master time
fan shooter must play game warning addicting hell
game realy make go oh wow map design realisation almost thing see far distance reach combat fit well dark soul game wich realy likeand find realy difficult wich exactly play
thanks lot dev team game realy enjoy far nice game week update guy play multiplayer
waste hour time broke save
game ca launch anymore even verifying multiple time
get want denuvo molest soul many cheater still good game
secret ending awesome secret ending bos going achievement breeze nice recommend game flaw solid fun experience
start well game broken
loose sheer bad luck due game spend hour right move campaing get squashed randomness making ai faction settlement opposite side map able win faster
nothing latest patch nothing fix realm god broken especially chaos undivided faction really poor excuse faction daemon lord really weird jack trade
give joy play really
cathay weirdly overpowered kislevites bad time
playing khorne dominate everything dont get started broken auto resolve strength still risk loosing force something might cost play
game weirdly consistent really demanding play battle matter got bad as lord chaos faction lord get nurgle corruption trait never loose trait lord actually broken since force never regenerate even city
always end getting trait fighting nurgle
broken mechanic cant cure chaos faction cure wait till sale empire called break ui
warhammer ii beutiful uis everything weird dark red color scheme doesnt match dont get started siege battle sure needed get form fix warhammer ii
constantly tower weird tower defense like mechanic work
tossed bin remove sense suspension disbelief cause freaking tower back second later shoot troop back doesnt even make sense use artillery tower better used troop since win destroying troop really
broken word
broken anyways fix game ca took money give promised
absurd well immortal empire work ambitious especially multiplayer campaign
know developer including creative assembly pull something like successfully risk hyperbole peak strategy genre overall probably best representation fantasy world video game
open world dark soul love game absolutely despise ca managment moment
f devs people work hard
since day biggus dickus seen badass titus vaginus
lived expectation year ago
would recommend even full price
also far intro game ever seen
first soul game ever played currently hour loving moment gameplay loop melee chip damage way high tool either preventing replenishing health
edit melee fencing defence type significantly reduced problem idea trying keep getting armour replenishing health sound one
chance replenish rare top armour little hp therefore regain insignificant often immediately lost
parry odd
found holding parry button delivers better result also successful parry timing done hit would land unlike famous parry inherently bad idea think quite novel interesting
especially imagery parry prepared better parry time
however utterly bed small enemy horde
predicting horde attack time see enemy wind prepare parry parry highjacked random enemy prepared turning perfect parry parry
lead getting stunlocked cardinal sin game like
absolute wank
edit completely removed using fencing defence type weapon
using one remove time parry make successful parry actual parry
although make game much much playable fun remove stunlocking kinda liked preparing idea would like see delegated rare bos heavy attack gun feel like term damage
rubric marine tank bolt round face unless ammo rare mentioned absolutely useless burn right
feel rarity maining melee class obvious everliving jump pack operation
give could fall map spawn top player npc happens
good reason neutered also customisation kind poor
guess come later able change superior
ca change lens colour thigh armour colour
fact mark x
give gorgeous mk helmet please make pay loading screen abysmal absurd
sometimes faster task manager game existence sit loading edit new fencing weapon feel kind op
know sound like complaining one problem mentioned fixed way
engaging stimulating either reduce damage minor enemy deal melee one tzeench minion take whole bar shield increase shield hp shield hp decent event like helbrutes hp raised helbrute damage slightly increase shield regen specific enemy execution
rubric marine give shield much damage deal increase health recovery taking damage lifespan
go away far fast actually act purposeful way regain shield
get nearly gun strike unexpectedly even though always attempting bash stun enemy
make bashing leading gun strike consistent minor enemy
use prepare parry mechanic minor enemy
play like strong strong enough put space marine back buff jump pack operation
go far active much campaign pvp
oh slam would op nerf slam damage going keep playing game every hope higher class level experience better ca good game slog hour get play nice

long story short go unbalanced autoresolve paper bag infantry either killed quickly sent halfway across map chariot get back angry armoured bear smashing nothing game worth money wait discount decent patch next year five
ca ever read next time listen fan youtubers used sell broken game thousand hour game personally believe know need change probability make money thats truly care game player want broken overpriced early access launch make excuse
p sorry review place never best writing explaining think point making clear game currently worth
gameplay basic
like bad version god war made even worse adding pointless stamen play lot action game probably think fun
one beautiful game played cool art style
light attack combo one time going throw ca recommend game action game fan
launch kind hot mess
realm chaos campaign repetitive questionable mechanic
reason pc max cyberpunk play thing hardlock every aside gameloop total war know love
immortal empire campaign week launch
included race really nicely designed
upcoming dlc look extremely promising ca warhammer dlc team keep
quality life upgrade fantastic good luck enjoying tw game without quick deal diplomacy
even look nice
sigh
ironically game space marine developed orks
tenative dropping ball latest future game seems much hopeful
next level

never liked soul type game recommended game friend never amazed visuals general gameplay elden ring
game absolute masterpiece wait dlc

negativity surrounding game come lot people willing give chance also want take time learn game
also new game long queue time server launch day

release pretty rough state however trying recently serious issue fixed least campaign good fun though sort campaign designed repeat playthroughs hopefully immortal empire release month give u sandboxy campaign
really fun game fan seasonal wipe tho
im probably gon na play wipe move ambitious warhammer game date
eight faction many multiple lord choice offer compelling varied campaign
rough edge previous two entry initially
time ironed expect
although human well made entertaining game recommend player plenty spare time happy rush game complete week season end
human need private server season server wipe number reason including casual player want take time explore map far much content cover week player work limited play time player primarily enjoy base building aspect want experience deviant base wiped seasonal server would provide variety game development community growth moneymaking opportunity note content buy real world money transferable moment waiting important issue dealt commit adding human permanent game rotation

seems like game poorly optimized especially graphic
running medium quality setting
right positive review privilege overall game cool
campaign interesting engaging first time play becomes repetitive
indeed performance issue game crash time time
bug found anything gamebreaking
thinking buying game would recommend wait month mortal empire fix dr wait ca optimize game mortal empire come friend dylan gay welcome estalia gentleman lie

throne decay dlc came changed negative review game support seen huge downgrade previous almost month main update recent chaos dwarf dlc overpriced whilst offering less legendary lord possible campaign compared tomb king vampire pirate flc quality also amazing lls imrik rakarth repanse almost useless lh bought previous dlcs show support might never buy anything continue trend overpriced slow content drip
positive review game getting better support since soc ca seems truly believe worst behind u ca keep quality dlc flc seen tod game lucrative future
hand worth waiting year far game ever reviewed steam
graphic superb lifelong warhammer fan year gaming tabletop game really true form hobbyist expect get
however veteran fact intended difficulty someone wanted u suffer tough start eas adapt level violence coming way
working team mate really enjoyable far really hope keep strong level support
far would recommend
would go im sure game deserves
nurgle must buy fan know nothing great blast friend
game disgrace saying lot even ca game
literally never written review game oh boy game make exception long legendary campaign hour time writing thousand total war game general ended abruptly could teleport spoiler forge soul intercept enemy
literally got prompt go waited turn
battle option ever came upon one turn completing given failed intercept campaign lost
like seriously
option campaign
even isolated issue
search soul issue feel like one able finish campaign
garbage get past playtesting
mention tzeentch faction mechanic pausing movement turn
know make warhammer suck real life
uninteractable require skill ca
normal overworld least hero try block movement
random frustration feature add nothing gameplay would give ai used player
enhance add strategic play game randomly stop strategic movement every turn oblivious obviously trash frustrating feature everyone tell like minor settlement battle played every campaign toddler difficulty
long nonsensical frequent autoresolve suck garrison loss v unit rebel blob
battle idea intentional still trash unit response time like dial internet connection china
sincerely hope incident compared total warhammer game even total war game general unit terrible response time command
could another attempt end frustration inducing
dictate lag executing order receiving still game
looking fight unit go forward
maybe make harder dodge magic feel like meaningless lag added piss
speaking pissing someone missile unit worse ever pathfinding
hundred time shoot something literally front impediment fire run straight melee
tw game issue never extent
point even want issue attack order line missile troop hard shoot begin without micro charge unimpeded sight line target
super excited try cathay close range rifle realized never fired target unless autotargeting
like took everything good tw wh game made suck
oh mention unit formation mean even ai decides pull entire unit rank shieldwall touch archer crap mechanic unstable gameplay would touch game couple year launch remove stupid mechanic added
improvement diplomacy like allegiance income trading settlement fudnamentally game feel clunky unresponsive frustrating till patch fix everything
good game
campaign bit short like way mostly throw ranged enemy armor permanently drained
also boss focus solved coop story great game play well encountered bug simple restart fixed another dollar please horrible optimization based
horrible company reduce bug fix leave bug year end claim cost increasing showing work actual product markedly increase dlc price less content previous dlcs
awful business practice
fun entertaining give try elden ring game main focus end shameful title maidenless given poor tarnished
killing demigod pat blue witch enchanting jellyfish ghost pat british blonde girl beaten death pat handicaped ginger wing sake maiden yes
something mending rune whatever
still maidenless refund game year playing as
maybe quick judge campaign still considered beta
december tell game improved immensely
devs active addressing community concern acting
ie recent change taking settlement tried bit pretty mid put many hour game mind funding along way
looking forward course correction see bug fix concern player addressed timely manner
would also like see return quality dlcs appropriately priced content feature offer
many missed opportunity since release done supporting ca make effort
emperor protects dont hug woman roundtable hold hugless virgin elden ring saved gaming
lose faith humanity simulator hour say one favourite game ever might favourite fromsoft title
nailed every aspect love soul title put expansive aesthetically gorgeous world
honest praise visual area design enough feel like larger grand
personally hail design perfect take said
usual music fantastic
many new type spell incantation open many interesting type build
ive personally planned multitude themed character play pvp pve
lore elden ring also superb think also accessible lore far fromsoft title
also general radahn absolute chad
criticism elden ring would copy pasted boss general enemy late area game bos bos fight
personally feel like crutch also diminish earlier emotion victory beating bos boss area imo lazy elden ring big game perhaps one largest ive ever played everything elden ring big grand absolutely deserves attention
game company made open world game well fromsoft
elden ring good discussed medium recent time ago
even happened january public still curious exactly happening reason rumor come good
time game became massive video gaming rumor
public especially hater shock
came good rumor spread massively
time bad game good rumor
rumor standardize truth according last reported game revealed good
still believe rumor really much talked people even person hater
return c go
сs ca fixed
obviously devs thought optimize main menu pfff need beautiful animated artwork background
faction selection screen interface performance would sleek cause know could one reason
thing optimized
nice result several year disappointment immeasurable day ruined
reject modernityembrace monkeee best game hope win game year game got better love game
letdown lack support hdr aspect ratio
review positive negative positive hopeful future game apologised shambolic hotfix cadence considerable increase price dlc
acknowledged dun intend make right even given pharaoh player partial refund reducing price think seen anyone asking think personally return game april throne decay dlc come delayed ensure get attention requires work update shadow change february leave review positive think statement today indicates might better trajectory world
everyone kill hacker everyone kill noob would buy inflation ca talking
türkiye
killing game community b dlc
play game without attitude make u angry
hour since ie launched really changed game better
ca wait content
simply put game high production value great story amazing gameplay combat loop deserves accolade bos design late game boss offering moderate challenge extra fun learn predatory bullsh microtransactions one time purchase hour fun

good game praise emperor miyazaki love everything warhammer fantasy game plus dlc get full experience warhammer fantasy whooping like bruh greedy reason especially like got ta pay blood come ca
really want dlc wait sale destroy wallet really bother right discus entitlement earn playing game cathe right positive review entitlement earn making game ca customer product received free finished campaign hour
additional point want add still maintaining original point
friend play lot time much time want play alone
steam single player category tag promise devs able progress solo caught attention
especially huge emphasis got incredibly interested
kind basis like start
obviously point opinion
feel free disagreebad point tried every startup install eos
stop installation like read tied essential play
odd choice pc player think steam based community consensus collection required default
disagree prompt game
lord know kind data actually collected sure defined somewhere fine print like usual
plainly tied online service
believe applies campaign repeat affect campaign wo leveling class offline
seen lot people try say based live service game
wasting time progressing play online
online service core part game
absolutely hate live service game bc one bad patch one bad decision devs could potentially destroy game future
helldivers good example biggest best fan favorite game year quickly turning unenjoyable one
live service model need solo possible maintaining online status operation gamemode
forced server play others
devs stated would possible play alone make progress knowledge possible time
short time like play casually want play alone customize space marine campaign use class
skin use titus campaign knowledge skin seen come ultimate edition
use class campaign
campaign likely sort intro game mechanic player untouched really lot content play right
get bored quickly grinding mission repeatedly
expect content future would wait personally care class ability
liked tactical sniper stand equipment limited class
watch game like hawk first picked think class would neutered weapon able equip
especially finishing campaign felt extremely limited performance experience terrible extremely inconsistent
gpu cpu jumping place
fps never got matter setting tried
good pc even like running system hard
could find nice middle ground performance visuals
definitely going need smoothing melee combat rough experience
horrid make worse remedying found hitting parry blue prompt dodging red one half time register
always possibility human error seems one experiencing edition one base edition even consider
like get season pas well skin would recommend gold edition ultimate edition ue plainly disappointing
especially since skin universal
ex
titus skin ue ca used operation pvp
skin get believe heavy class ca used campaign
get three skin think certain weapon universal ca exactly say worth
buy ue
simply worth
bought ultimate edition hefty discount another store
advise looking still want ue heck even gold edition play game early get season pas skin enough justify price tag
absolutely outrageous
good point game performance great experience crash like lot others
crashed maybe
time thought bunch stuttering would lead crash
reading people ca get past first cut scene gunplay feel great
variety gun much smooth reload animation everything look really graphic beautiful
devs really knocked campaign story although short great
fluent warhammer lore ca say lore wise happy much criticism game praise review turn positive devs smooth performance rebalancing class must imo quite bad
deliver promise playing solo u solo player casuals
typical game devs say feature performance etc
launch give u week game promised
ultimately decide would wait week even month check back
update first patch second part game dropped day ago guess use update fix bug still bug game since warhammer
ignored focused fixing ppl playing game way ca like fun yes ca like
everything immortal empire fun stuff fun warhammer everything bad broken bugged stuff shoved warhammer
magic buff improve magic hero work oh ppl using spell working well
got nerf magic trash broken
choice focusing really make sad
loved warhammer game bad choice well keep draining fun game
limit play style file edge made game better total war made race feel different fun play
played warhammer nonstop year think even played another week warhammer patch dlc depressing lacking
took break playing week launch bad came back tried mod fix game enough waited immortal empire
deal crappy game design put warhammer play race form warhammer nope hit stick
like really maybe new idea bringing warhammer bad maybe ppl wanted warhammer new race quality life tweeks actual bug fix feeling sad every single race big chunk carved dev team even know made warhammer good warhammer bad still learned lesson going prioritised patch week launch rome bug heartless cash grab nice see ca changed one bit
still willing use abuse fan
never trust ca every time look like getting better drop buggy unfinished mess fan uncaring smile face
buy game
wait year steep discount really want
maybe might get complete game least got cheap
played ever faction time towards end hitting turn end ally every boarder
ca total war nope best army best leader nope every turn enjoy total board game like ca designed
game feel like hate letter ca every total war fan
one best game ever gripesi havfromsoftware dark soul game dark soul series like dark soul fight bos time like dark soul manus fight less dodging hitting right time using mimic tear tank unblockable attack spamming spell far want use many different mean defeat enemy
shame find work isnt fun challenging
using new mechanic often feel like crutch difficulty rather challenge
game specifically hardship give meaning experience
miyazakithe hardship game challenge put upon use determines think game meant played exploring open world get op stuff make fight formula never fails different great part game often unbalanced unnecessary open worldelden bing company game launch boring company made base game free expect price big said increased price smaller month without bug fix news pull support game people complain price increasethey support start game company despite older said initiative directed hit piece reviewer creator resource new game going flop need promised would give year support gamethis company ea tier screw
greatest game ever made thank fromsoft game gud right positive recommendation entitlement earn playing game
dodge parry mechanic super clunky
solo campaign mission veteran unbearable since getting focused everything bot
coop campaign fine tho make work issue
game force install egs service option
spoiler end third act already say confidence one best game released recent year
great graphic detailed environment interesting combat system different combat stance skill tree crafting fascinating setting story awesome cutscenes
found game quite challenging start understand combat system becomes much easier
beginning game seems linear nothing closer act thing change lot
location getting lot bigger interesting
game highly encourages exploration location lot hidden content different side quest optional boss even sometimes useful game mechanic hidden behind side quest hub blacksmith
dark soul elden ring something closer sekiro god war feel like whole game made fight boss feel like asset flip unique visuals move set
game worth money developer done good job game supported
definitely recommend
monkey ca even play game time trying get
importantly frequently crash opening cinematic open black screen
hope patch fix play right basically wasted money fixed game become real blast
really think sometimes start always rough sometimes get fixed
game reminds good time simple video game fun
warhammer fan
new warhammer solid introduction vast universe nutty amount lore delve
game challenge fun
emperor right discus entitlement earn playing game main campaign great co op fun friend pvp seems unfinished unpolished still enjoyable
good comfort game
best game ever
dog finished platinum game right time leave review astonishing game great story great feel dbz great ambience graphic music gameplay wise also really good innovative price course little high taste want game reccomend take discount worth money tho thought soul like bos easy almost first try except last one anyways reccomend buy since first project took lot year resourcers future make great game like vote would give game year
know maybe
""
many cool game around year know
always weak foe
good hour campaign completed highest diff weapon melta really stingy ammo would nicer especially take upwards shot shot mag kill anything bigger super stingy really need full heal station dotted throughout campaign mission found struggling stay alive especially fire enemy second half game medicae stims pretty enemy second half game felt really easy felt super understand might minority would really liked helmet cutscenes setting great game probably best game played literal year probably one best game ever played life
amalgamation practically previous game every feature every design every skill honed course year making game put gigantic incredibly immersive world constantly rewarded adventuring
think pretty safe say get game like anymore especially without flood pay convenience abomination plagued game last year
good as game full stop
one game lived hype somehow managed exceed lot way
like abusive relationship hate miss gone
yes please wtf valve free play buy prime well csgo fun learn get global offensive free rage simulator study russian language without living learn spend hundred dollar virtual knife exist outside experience become gain habit changing mouse every search learn whats best way break learn year old going next learn going kill think kitchen knife might look like put realize going lose several match get try relax join another finally start start losing teammate ca keep punch desk like arch bite realize really going think happening become monster find something tell best uninstall promise wo play day get back normal time hear pretend like think could possibly go wrong start playing promise wo rage go crazy install repeat listcongratulations
successfully became c go player well done
terrible pricing policy understand developer paid effort like everyone else
go beyond everything bad game actually great
reset every week id prefer reset im gon na play one im done monke string attack boss flailing jumping flipping breaking target lock see probably finished string try get one little know unreactable delayed aoe explosion end string punish attempt get tiniest bit damage
maybe fling sword air twelve second catch rolling absurd delay
bos describe
""
advancement moveset game soul ability jump almost enemy use mechanic
every weapon art bloodhound step raptor virtually useless boss
torrent available boss often enough often straight worse foot
get anything cool bos cool
boss would way fun game expands character capable like sekiro nioh monhun
beaten game four time finished dlc
bad game
cranked bos health bar damage movesets absurd degree left player character roll block attack using since demon done dlc probably never boot replay game ever shame
want love game much slog ever
unreasonable price increase new dlc developer reaction community response make recommend game time
counter offensive global strike
spoiler alert riding motorbike sudden im like main antagonist ratatouille
like lowkey got past made entirely nostalgia location motorbike first person camera
game needless say look like real life even medium setting
game promising
however current state simply recommend
mechanic awesome combat great issue would like address
make crafting resource story building resource fun network desync even closest combat due desync server offer better connection na server
know ping equal steady animation like resource gathering buggy
chopping tree mining ore show properly equipped weapon default wipe every six week leaving casual player work feeling left
tearing looking sky
sometimes conclusion although game issue show promise future
many issue addressed fixed update likely
however lag desync take joy experience
wanted continue play could get overlook issue
seems like manage go fight enemy really becomes annoying
elephant room must addressed
make game wipe six week
understand pvp might need avoid new player discouraged would still like think early
game solid foundation issue need addressed
absolute masterpiece
testosterone level tripled playing
favorite campaign experience since red dead
literally single handedly restoring faith industry turned fan
devs make sequel buy instantly
""
thank saber
looking forward enjoying many hour operation pvp well
try fingersbut hole elden ring every review subjective aligns perception taste interest person writing
someone view video game another form artistic expression assign score
believe art measured quantified
simply share personal experience avoiding spoiler much possible
elden ring essentially culmination everything fromsoftware refined year previous title wrapped vast open world invite exploration discovery
could describe elden ring one word would lost
like fromsoftware game one filled moment entirely sure enemy fighting go correct path
yet sense lost frustrating driving force push keep going
something magnetic urge press forward explore every corner map search npc item clue might give direction
progress thing become convoluted
finally defeat enemy tougher one appears
think grasped part lore new information emerges force rethink everything
game constantly keep state uncertainty wondering whether taken right path strayed dangerous clear indicator progress elden ring bos fight scattered dialogue grace placed across map
sense accomplishment defeating bos unparalleled serf reminder despite confusion challenge making standout aspect elden ring sheer size richness world
game always enjoyed exploring every last corner zone title exception
world vastness visually term content impressive
thrill discovering new area finding secret drive keep playing
however explored encountered one game criticized aspect repeated boss
common practice game expected fromsoftware maintain unique touch originality
perhaps decision reuse boss driven ambition make world large possible first attempt game
personally mind much boss became increasingly challenging new attack pattern case fight feel nearly identical
despite shortcoming overall experience tarnished xd thoroughly enjoyed every battle striving improve encounter
erdtree erdtree expansion brings new mechanic narrative focus complement base experience elden ring
first accessed expansion thought would similar dlcs studio game high level would wrong
erdtree introduces unique mechanic intertwines game lore
choose ignore detail prepared suffer like never
fascinating expansion add content also manages maintain essence make elden ring special expanding world way feel natural
despite new content elden ring erdtree opinion accessible extent easiest experience fromsoftware developed
say lack challenge design emphasis exploration freedom somewhat softens conclusion confidently say elden ring best game created term ambition design execution
however interestingly favorite
despite everything mentioned feel desire replay cause feel like experience
contrast bloodborne favorite game studio could play
despite technically inferior several way bloodborne atmosphere design find appealing invite better dream
fan total war game since shogun particularly enjoyed total warhammer
unfortunately really really quite sure thinking change made almost change worse compared new settlement tower barricade
pure cancer
tower particular utterly unbalanced make every battle slog
say every battle rather siege battle ai absolutely refuse fight open field unless outnumber hugely
three open field battle hour play
big fun battle meant centrepiece game one fails fundamental new mechanic rift chaos randomly appear territory every turn
one annoying mechanic could devised
way prevent take province corruption three turn discourge enemy agent land often enemy army
mean viable tactic turtle spam end turn since expand protect province game economy broken
make one army nearly impossible especially due necessary turtling good luck saving enough money get decent settlement unless farm slaanesh good ai
lolno ai faction war make beeline player matter stupid
always issue much worse
ai also outright blatantly cheat respect main quest watch front eye even worse collect soul instant game option buy time defeating ui
far inferior
run like legless paraplegic floor made needle
look forward constant graphical glitch
quite game breaking one find wasted several hour going ditch game big combined map come mod support get rid many many issue gameplay actively present coming someone actually quite liked vortex campaign lot people complained sadly first tw game simply recommend
hopefully fix patch suspect much unfixable represents inexplicable design decision would need redesigned ground
regardless keep open mind hope change review positive later date
game absolutely beautiful lot fun
however ive spent much time trying reconnect server play online actually playing
spending expect game squeaky clean happen like helldivers
recommend game
wasteland barren expanse futile effort frivolous cocktail umbrella storm
picture legion developer hunched screen burning midnight oil crank sequel
mirage innovation
skin sticker case forged tear unicorn
face reality investor gambler house always player motley crew keyboard warrior embroiled virtual skirmish forgotten taste fresh air
circus kind clown cotton candy
circus squeaker ringmaster lost control animal running glory lack thereof monumental waste time
see
best game come year
im glad im able pour hundred hour masterpiece game
fromsoftware game part always continue greatest game ever made
untill point bloodborne favorite game elden ring might take spot
well soulsborne fan buy new genre research buying
fromsoftware game category game go thinking something might dissapointed
game hard sometimes brutaly hard thats partly make amazing
dont go thinking average rpg much sure preformance bit lacking place bla bla bla someting need fixed bla bla something one care game great dont give stutter tiny winy bit traveling horseback play game stop cry baby
cry fact there cheater pvp cause thats actually real problem
everything game
bad game dont buy breathtaking
game year
dark soul jump goty
met john understand frustration aspect game namely whole server issue
though game amazing quality life aspect well fun game mechanic addition
would say art wise death stranding meet control
game play wise mash fallout new world
lot fun

scenery game suffers poor design choice online play

wan na roll
quit title screen try
spend long time loading find class wanted play already taken someone worse preferred class taken
suddenly ca ruthless run signed class leveled
back battle barge roll load randomly disconnect without easy way connecting operation
game waste lot sure obvious issue designer really considered
waste lot time waiting searching match play
game anticheat serversbut still cant quit great game bug great community finally good food c gordon ramsayafter year year year really bad warhammer game thq left u suffer failure like eisenhorn various turn based cringe game indie game fantasy game dow let emperor make forget god know elsewe finally got fine successor good warhammer game also sequel game bug flying search food also heretic funny plot game pretty much instead orks fight nids brutally
""
time gon na chaos marine thousand son lot nod previous game overall game way serious lore accurate better worse

finally lot lot gore repetative tiresome
wanted horde game nids got else would want grimdark really overall design game masterpiece
long time since could actually immerse warhammer game
swarm bug everywhere
literal pile dead body disaster actual war absolutely love actual level design
mostly corridor hidden collectible thats music sound say really standart epic cinematic warhammer ost video warhammer space marine ost onslaught nima fakhrara steve molitz view warhammer space marine ost onslaught
music nima fakhrara steve molitz really think sound game amazing
sound bolters chainswords tyranid scream also goodim actually surprised well titus new comrade developed different nids shootthousand son well presented although really fun fight main villain thing dont like beside chaplain cadian major oooof bad decision ask grim dark future let talk replay boy done campaign collect every collectible done every achivo could done single player curse terminator combo curse save ravener time pvp easy since people active pve well

ok think might good time since immortal empire arrived game feel soo much betterit feel like given underwhelming appetizer receive absolutely delicious main course many patch update arrived made previous review fixing area previous mentioned rift balancing issue bias aito honest realm chaos campaign still meh atleast bad fun timesthe prologue still really good anything else done actually pretty good tutorial teaching game work mechanic oh boy immortal empire beloved true reason would get game
giant map different sort faction scattered around unique experience basically every legendary lord rostermany campaign different lord interesting experience whether challenge opponent face ally make battle fight faction blast considered less enjoyable experience still moment joy
immortal empire map actually ridiculously huge many part map aesthetically pleasing look many small detail add world warhammer
personally cathay realm chaos nice locationsthe graphic game good model great fact ca taken old game workshop model updated game thing must say game performance rough immortal empire map rough performance atleast computer top game player coop
simultaneous turn waiting others end turn

отличная игра но брать только по скидке preordered game wanted save review later feel time
fan since beginning
truly game crazy undertaking whole history pc strategy game
blast like blast cw game stopped playing chaos dwarf dlc came
felt much like rip
opened eye
let show bought game dlcs sale
per dlc averaging warhammer never played bought sale faction champion chaos lol rounding
even couting sale tax canada
stupid
let happen without even realizing part sure hell come well choose part anymore
life getting cheaper
company person take anyone granted like
say vote wallet well guest buy baldur gate instead game respect community
monkey brother monkey brotheryou great
guess loses end
waste time dlc price increased much amount content included
game spark warhammer
waste time money
plus dev team trash
really excited space marine played first classic among warhammer fan however space marine nothing buggy upon release
campaign designed played friend many bug make impossible
firstly assembled squad seemed fin got infinite loading server bug
ok thought would easy fix turn steam overlay stuff work
first time
got actually play min fun got soft locked flower wall first mission
quick reload last checkpoint good min got soft locked airlock entrance bunker
time loading checkpoint didnt work decided start mission
got infinite loading bug current state space marine unplayable buggy mess u id imagine playing single player might work campaign clearly designed multiplayer working u
godrick command thee kneel
also godrick
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
option play offline bot always online
mean get disconnected might loose progress
happened twice
would glad option play offline option customize pvp character jumping matchmaking
wait game fin team leave config loadout
came messed ux also freeze operation end exiting desktop mess character configuration cool right ca recommend
game like crack
terrible health keep coming back
problem saying constructive criticism allowed space mean get decide constructive
joke
taking right privilege else would stay away ca game unless want abuse dictator
terrible launch
boring main campaign horrible domination multiplayer mode
early release inmortal empire game improved dlc policy already bad made expansion even expensive less must mention company bad attitude towards playerbase veiled threat discontinuation game censorship regarding player opinion
intolerable seems improved pace update
hope first step improve
secret world conan exile baby fortnite signed restraining order later one thats human one promising mmo game ive played smooth graphic fun bossfights amazing building crafting system specialisation make engaging multiplayer trade also would like point max player setting server kinda needed since build everywhere
would clusterf ck controlled dalso game working amazing fey minor building problem mostly people value crazy realistic one crash hour due overloading game multiple process command believe solid game
updating review given update shadow change
added additional content make feel bit comfortable latest dlc
thanks listening ca
mod would catch game saved virginity epic game
real one best surprise end coop campaign insane everything perfect love pvp real u loved tps gore go xd game recommend hard
patch insane complaint reviewer highly recommended game performance terrible fact worse patch given play review
believe get fixed believe reviewer recommended game lie strong point game
looking past stuttering new region see amazing open world difficult enemy beginner friendly travel system difficult enemy loot difficult enemy
mean fan soulsborne series however saw charm quick demo playing
must say experiencing even experiencing title sure give game shot one without centipede btw monkey problem elder rig
arrogant suspicion inquisition failed recognise truth evil ever overcome devotion
around hour campaign devs manage pack much story much lore much fun look feel like xbox game mean best possible compliment think mean game simply ton fun story simple yet well done something like brothership thrust hardship overcoming odds need complex world chaos disgrace corruption together brother punish herectics responsible mess easy said well done far one fun enjoyable game played recently
wanted say word well go play damn game
forget glory ultramar
sorry english
probably wo popular opinion feel none played c lot first released mod
put hundred hour pub match match friend private server
stopped playing time make move retail product franchise something time capsule
example late shooter frozen time never really change probably make novel average gamer important competitive scene formed around taken control lot way style competitive scene formed around put valve difficult position ca really change anything without facing harsh resistance veteran player
even minor visual change met extreme criticism may upset carefully cultivated always like
playing idea level competitive play starting manifest thus rare find player get wrapped memorizing spread pattern researching dominant strategy reading established meta
lot player back fun play huge playerbase thus meaning server always reasonably available back commitment
overall behavior playerbase different
may gotten usual smack talk match people telling thing exactly certain way order whole thing play like match either least great number essentially test see much like getting player
overly welcoming place new player though everyone negative new player help culture
culture either really cool annoying hell much room anything want competitive gaming experience largely shaped competitive vocal player
""
want something like typical modern shooter something casual best place end opinion understand going different experience different people
know probably bit old thus missed competitive level gaming boat year change fact played global offensive culture formed around game something really get
mileage course may
usual people make huge deal nothing
conplain dumbest thing complain difficulty simultaneously refusing lower etc
know drill game fun
run great play great
story engaging albeit pretty standard fare gameplay shine
angel death adapt use right weapon right situation position correctly
ca roflstompimaspacemarine way everything way could first bloody fun look great
great sequel
monke almost k hour game hate hate game want die mate call play still come ツ playing total war game since empire around hour total owned total war game warhammer absolute disgrace
game still countless bug listing would take long others thankfully done already review gall charge dollar new dlc price chaos dwarf like less content
absolutely revolted especially recent statement community basically said stop support game suck buy overpriced lacking content dlc probably introduce new bug wont fixed month end
due recent development longer support franchise could recommend game company product anyone good faith anymore thus uninstalling warhammer never buy another ca product issue resolved timely fair manner
edit beat game
best game ever goodpc port still issue
update driver
good luck
fromsoftware please stop bad pc release someone huge fan total war series since empire total war back hour game play different game feel like good understanding say warhammer huge disappointment start limited amount faction play playing campaign limited set unit faction faction unit renown main story bad time get repetitive there many way complete campaign faction absolutely terrible compared others legion chaos one unit get weak version actual faction worshipping single chaos god
main campaign also game breaking bug make game fun play example buddy got one settlement attacked drop battle ogre attacking bug entrance settlement sit till dead giving free win clearly
battle player clearly stronger army lord hero attack say something along line valiant defeat know fact iron dragon cathay supposed eat nurglings like morning cereal forced waste minute time drop battle completely unnecessary begin
select unit send somewhere reason stand still even selecting trying move time
immortal empire aware still working get better last patch made thing worst removed minor settlement siege battle cause apparently people live tree instead building reason constantly making terrain hill opponent
large settlement tower placement terrible often behind tall building wall tower shot never connect constantly hit everything intended target
wall get taken peasant sword spear tower get murdered tier harpy literally lose everything else
unit also break moral stupidest way running hp enemy unit instead running away reason even sitting healthy unit lord hero still present
could keep ranting amount issue found would taken way much time
anyway say total war warhammer incomplete game industrial amount balancing bug fixing becomes fun worth play currently fun part game immortal empire even allow player select race apart warhammer game example buddy mine dlcs game wo let choose faction even though already owns content forced buy able access faction already paid
returning game worked even probably pay get additional content supposed begin may refund game stick know anymore
thank taking time read rant feel free let know guy think
year later everything still broken mechanic barely work nonsensical everything keep getting could grande finale tww trilogy
blatantly unfinished cash charging lord pack
since played game great story
doesnt get game year rigged
""
gameplay really repetitive everyone said opinion fun ig graphic make forget reality story read journey west
else wont get whats going character know know xd joke aside dept lore character really good character design never knew anyone think far
""
soundtrack good soundtrack heard better combat like soul game yea would appreciated parry overall
definitely goty worthy
recommended anyone looking immersive experience amazing story line visually stunning graphic challenging bos fight
easily get lost landscape exploring searching every nook cranny trying find next hidden treasure bos
love small meditation spot game make search take moment actually stop real life actually focus breath well jumping next intense bos fight
mention amazing soundtrack cherry would get lost stunning masterpiece
come brother destroy heretic
think finally time change review negative positive

total war warhammer get
game league developed fleshed game
story tw hand better mess
mechanic better thought game mod level nerfs across board every race strategy could employed beat game made difficult giving ai broken address issue correct problem ai mechanic game devs chose nerf solution problem ignoring overlapping carried
find similar bug game find least get unique race get interesting end game reward completing game currently one mode slated get improvement alternate mode june afaik
month release going thing game really feel like product secondary dev team communication interaction people made prior game fun enjoyable
game really feel like someone pet project resume padding care actually game horrifically phoned know
well spoiler win campaign given demon prince command army
thats neat demon faction play human faction guess reward beating demon group creature lore antithetical existence
guess human queen character spent year banishing demon back hell going given original demon prince lead army rather getting embodiment country religion even avatar bear god worked hard save variance reward completing campaign different faction steam achievement
benefit gained completing important milestone overarching campaign
nothing ridiculous challenge put front still beaten nerfed unit eventually second
devs overwhelmingly nerfed unit used win hardest difficulty campaign prior game still failed actually accomplish goal
even nerfs certain unit always use others cost effectiveness thing accomplished devs overuse disappearing weird wonky used avoid spend battle easy win changed always punishing player
could full elite army going two dude hovel elite army come autoresolve almost obliterated two mud farmer broken game nothing attempt dlc brings nothing really new series world actually retcons lot stuff prior game also incredibly boring play
spent time trying undo massively dumb decision allied ai make correct weird thing happen anything worth
wait till maybe december check back game come sale like dropping money really getting worth really want play game like go tw get
expensive full get base game use rest sale
league better game right
enjoying game far
sure still performance improvement made game pretty good would say
ca wait immortal empire
rarely write review conscience compels warn others might avoid massive disappointment game fan total war warhammer series
glaring issue related gameplay well technical
honestly astounded state game even nearly five month release
game pas sort quality control
review done great job detailing gameplay issue merely mention technical issue encountered
radeon rx barely eek fps game
say game poorly optimized would understatement
let game choose setting use recommended setting fps drop around rendering game completely unplayable
chance read considering buy game
go buy total war warhammer ii instead already superior almost every way
hundred hour zip game twenty hour game nightmarish slog
expected year waiting
right wallet privilege
best soul game
hell best game
git veteran invader probably like game
much focused around open world exploration aspect game pvp
said game also absolute worst camera angle seen title fromsoft make main story boss incredibly unpleasant fight
build diversity really go away pvp need use bloodhound step survive almost situation involves one opponent
true combo mean crazy hard turn burn get reset getting chased multiple opponent
see longevity invasion scene game
really sad someone put countless hour pvp
duel likely popular ever auto camera recovery broken cause even setting bounce wall time
lock onto bos animation moving quickly camera go nut
personally felt fighting camera bos half time
said single main story still netted around hour thats pretty killer compared release general
played soul game probably love game much streamlined definitely best
improved source large number problem
getting kicked competitive leaving middle round result accuracy problem hardware problem
however still deep within like playing
need little bit reworked
love playing game almost every faction feel different really issue ai player support full army settlement
like get whole make player wipe ai also fully stacked army peasant helping defend garrison army make almost impossible
however fun playing game taking soul enemy
game good
like strategy game perfect franchise
say base game okay greatest imo realm chaos campaign mechanic fun
tedious depending faction playing conquer basically whole map actually win campaign
champion chaos dlc realm chaos campaign good since operate different mechanic feel much get juice game
game best game give access immortal empire campaign combine map previous game big map previous faction
gimmick worry
conquer map objective depending faction
giant sandbox roughly different legendary lord play different start ability buff etc
also need game play ie immortal empire friend owns game play
able use stuff
game use faction game
game use respective faction dlc
player campaign entirely coop however want
want alliance someone go war someone else go
also get turn time great feature stuck waiting someone else turn sit twiddling thumb
get situation maybe want attack army start walking towards lord walk lord lot variety unit battle one biggest highlight game personally
campaign map like civilization clash another army whatever becomes rts control unit
honestly much fun give game dlc mod base campaign
mod get rid realm chaos mechanic add replayability game focus dumb portal
get wrong realm chaos good playthrough tedious
access immortal empire game shoot
offer ton variety make game feel fresh different race faction choose
creative assembly license total war engine modding community
community one transaction actually care hollow corporate series product
used passion series
trojan horse bland dump mediocre dlc
one best game past disgusting micro transaction advance faster world full event diverse weapon multiple game free
day done starry studio well done
great game play brother removed ton content
removed stats achievement
removed resemblence separate game fine true valve fashion screw big time like everything else past year
cool monkey story hour gameplay including side coop mission least part story also content grind enjoyed
think great intro people new gameplay fun class gun available right enough variation enjoy keep playing
game lack though mission content
mission feel get bit boring maybe hour grinding
variation spawn spawn certain part mission path mission run enough
granted devs plan expand pvp mode extend game life bit yet try although think probably gon na quite game look beautiful run smooth ram issue try quit game actually quit
kill id recommend story wait expanded dlc release wait game go sale
also got ultra edition unless want support game content give gold really worth
total war warhammer gaming equivalent game throne season immortal empire arrival game redeemed
really hope great bright future tw warhammer good game
early access title want black myth invisible wall game really solid far
lot without punishment come along
far boss fun beat
story somewhat easy follow given amount lore provide
love skill tree respec available time allowing strategy change different boss
overall pretty solid game issue invisible wall invisible wall frustrating give feeling big area explore frustrated hit wall
cry loud even ledge invisible wall find later explore lower area
either provide skill reduces fall damage design map actually show boundary graphical issue suffering fsr high graphic
literally lose bos fight stuttering frame traversal map traversal boring
like monkey wo even swing around
currently chapter seem hint mechanic game
even jump much use outside combat use janky also link back invisible wall issue
sure bit transform something fun vine swinging web swinging spidey ui design generally ui pretty solid
issue item wheel
drink name align intended effect
would think evil repelling drink kind holy negation drink right
wrong
physical damage negation buff
""
hope fix adding icon drink effect item wheel
gave cancer made racist enemy emperor still draw breath peace
kinda suck fun p wish pvp
add cosmetic chaos space marine
add enemy execution pvp
make melee combat playable future company game looking quite grim time send message
pretty much monkey stick
cool fun beware long droopy earlobe monkey skin taser dead geime plei fortnit beter buy

give money deserve
queue game get kicked enough hour game community snoozefest

black myth wukong game challenging enjoyable
beautiful graphic smooth combat
game feel epic amazing
game came close loved animated scene
grandma could play hard challenge reckoned heat confrontation pvp game m good original artistic beautiful game basic element contractual people want well leading model get inspired story short long infinity filling trivial good fitting game artistic transcending whisper forgotten would rather watch paint hard repetitive good sticking remember long experience wait mod definitely infinitely replayable almost never heard minor bug get impact player experience game big terrarium run average nasa perfect could complete waste worth nothing else wait completely different game missing many feature look similar steam better expected masterpiece patch feature final taking time read think review
hypnotic fighting flow environment
love game
qol change enough reccomend game
improvement alliance siege corruption welcome addition
quite leap still nice improvement new faction bit barebones moment excellent variety well match flavour faction
daemon prince particular excellent achievement really enjoyed
seems game ca really invested immersing warhammer world even greater extent game series
example campaign map little icon hover get lore information particular site interest throughout world
make even surprising lore bit previous game lord quest landmark building seem scaled back lot
landmark kind quest longer perform several task get end goal
done yet one done consisted get level x fight battle little justification battle preparatory step beforehand
caveat however
stand much strongly narratively driven total war game including
campaign constrained story though extent others said perfectly possible large empire constant expansion
added ability ignore story extent still play around even engage
issue enjoy different approach total war campaign usual paint map empire building work within bound narrative come challenge difficulty
particular lot mechanic serve feature larger empire intrusive mechanic become stage previous total war longer threatened anyone finishing map painting harder achieve
however many longtime total war fan enjoying different direction main campaign constraint writing roadmap timeline future expansion
immortal empire campaign combined map game including faction coming point hopefully soon introduce much larger sandbox mode normal total war experience would wait mode
mode also requires total war game platform steam epic etc
lot investment someone new also quite number bug others annoying
actively worked based experience tw game lot ironed time
played campaign one broken point abandon others little irritant
still played nearly hour month though clearly bug overly diminish fun bit issue well
played ultra setting everything occassionally slowdown late campaign
still able play ultra setting battle function good framerate campaign map start struggling keep onwards long pause figure something frequent frame oddity
cavalry feel better entry series infantry responsive still issue infantry movement ranged unit targeting ordered
large improvement look like ca still working ironing issue
part battle feel essentially though ai seem improved
example ai would always attempt flank cavalry
involved swinging cavalry wing charging flank
placed unit covering flank ai would often charge covering unit regardless good matchup
enemy cavalry continue move around position find good angle attack
move around unit go artillery missile unit instead
still issue ai recognising considered defender mean standing still waiting best tactic overall feel much intelligent
ai struggle new siege little never seeming make mind whether want fight cap point leading either efficiently
additionally pathfinding settlement pretty difficult
ai make fairly good use new supply mechanic though cheat bit cooldown time rarely ever build tower preferring spam cheaper one nice new survival battle nice provide good variety player
however long draining
autoresolved aside last one good sometimes effort survival battle take however punishing higher difficulty end bit coming one short pro many qol feature improvement new faction excellent immersive warhammer universe previous game ai improvement campaign forcing new playstyles new solution issuescons fan enjoying main campaign story bug battle quirk need fixing performance issuesi rate game currently stand little doubt number rise patch expansion come game probably best game ever played apolgy bad englishwhere u wen diei home eating dorito phone ring kill iron within iron without beat game eye closed hand tied behind back still thought easyexcept godskin duo true final bos game year old loved csgo much consumer skin changed traded ak blue laminate scamed
took skin sad prayed gaben night woke middle night gaben
standing naked handed stattrak gut knife winked left window csgo love csgo life absolute masterclass arpg
everything painstakingly crafted rich background material moulded something new darker
story journey west known sequel
animation cutscenes combat visuals story character development
game
love big meaty action rpgs rich lore great story game
exploration exactly lot invisible wall game far open world
still need open world world
item rng based drop enemy harvesting plant
diablo style arpg work soulslike third person arpg might rub achievement hunter wrong beautiful experience
would recommend
game terrible
improvement currently terrible
suggest trying balanced polished previous part tw franchise
get game immortal fixed whatever bug gave problem late game find ca continue playing ai going whatever tedious warp world
play expand conquer
""
limited play till ai make whatever hoop need win
add fact portal come every many slot build city construct block appearing territory
completely slowing quickly expand burst needing go back land mid charge destroy portal start spawning army harass
pretty unforgivable together point
thought campaign bad take cake
maybe game like quick game slow burn going toe toe ever get biggest opposite
could forgive raw lot game feel different tactic take even get late game ca forgive different play throughs finally got past turn still picking steam going back game refuse load
hit continue campaign whatever reason load maybe quarter bar crash
every single time
done fresh install put ssd
nothing fixed
start game normally start new campaign
even trying load save game already started crash spot
given zero incentive play game
wish hurry put put get playing original best extra till game dead
game good make want beat son relentlessly immortal empire think game deserves positive review
still issue game well worth playing get better
best video game ever played
considering third title series underwhelming
also despise dlc practice developer
total war warhammer full poor design decision
campaign fun
race bland produce samey fight
easily worst total war warhammer war warhammer immortal empire beginning culmination year work show
map glorious size
shuffling several llords alongside new addition mean whole new experience
difference faction magnified full world turned loose
game hoping see total war warhammer franchise first started
spent roughly hour riding horse chased giant double jumped side mountain met santa clause
black myth wukong definitely game china recent year
know chinese gaming market flooded online game mobile game making indie game considered surefire way lose money fail
release black myth completely shattered notion showing investor massive potential market
bet future china able produce aaa game buy outright main text review
game feature highly detailed sculpture model created scan along finely crafted scene
voice acting soundtrack incredibly
excellent combat progression
several cutscenes distinct
game based classic chinese mythological novel journey west
many chinese people dreamed becoming monkey king sun wukong way game help u fulfill childhood dream
invisible wall frustrating area look accessible actually
lighting contrast high diffuse reflection low making shadow overly
color palette chapter monotonous lacking visual guidance make easy get
bos design really annoying like general miaoyin demon lord
hour still beginning chapter
thought game pretty linear first oh gosh much chapter many secret uncover mention graphic beautiful story interesting chapter always go youtube find explanation lore
combat system highlight fluid amazing
like soul game hard wu kong defeat every bos attempt
really love cutscenes music video
highly recommended absolutely contender game year
lack diversity review

paint anything eat crayon
product received free believe major upgrade series

also brought new system defensive war nice term gameplay
please remember update driver since change great optimisation compared corruption view way better new defensive war settlement change supply system diplomacy way fighting animation vary leader nice campaign system better vortex campaign high minor bug glitch probably solved soon auto resolve battle somewhat odd

best game warhammer fan recommend
system every six week soft wipe continue current season keep player level map progress reset back level wipe map progress able move next season
keep item
overall seems like useless feature battlepass reset
understandable player level
dumb
lot bug mission even matchmaking instead want use game lfg make process finding mission whole lot annoying scummy timed item see mobile game paid item arse
drop negative review hope get rid week wipe
""
game amazing everything community always wanted
co op better bigger longer siege lazy health bar afk unit marked lot thing
including making charachter able fight online even ultra graphic bit better opinion sometimes moment weird sure explain
btw im recommended spec also sometimes unit forget order seems
final last thing least reason get major lag spike npc finished turn turn start
amazing game ca wait mortal empire added
need monitor refresh rate blood blood godskulls skull throne score said
narrative rooted true literary masterpiece
interpretation find intriguing aligned overall message game seek convey though might differing view certain aspect twisted original story
however purely subjective detract quality design absolutely love landscape character design costume
someone grew reading journey west seeing novel mythical creature brought life game exhilarating experience
environment breathtaking immersive grand buddha statue architectural element leaving profound impact
game feature stunning scenery ever encountered feel authentically reminiscent place actually seen
simply design bos design quite impressive move visually striking others distinctly unique
set apart defy conventional trope offer refreshing experience
uniqueness credit original author novel ancient chinese folklore drew really like boss go detail since want avoid system combat animation cool spell visually captivating especially huge fan wukong
way spell represented aligns well main critique lie
prefer engaging combat directly confronting enemy rather relying heavily dodging waiting opening strike game
game least attempt incorporate character ability primarily spell
opinion key distinction action game game lie player influence enemy behavior
action game allow interruption counter disruption rewarding player maneuver strong sense game monkey interrupt parry enemy done heavy light attack spell rather core combat system
biggest issue lack dedicated blocking counter system placing much emphasis dodging
parrying heavy nice idea bring fluidity combat quite lot time fail
also lot attack parry option dodge use magic
result less interactive combat diminishes overall experience
opinion ghost tsushima excellent interactivity though understand different scenario mostly human boss setting
overall feel heavy parry derived staff technique spell ability intriguing fall short delivering level interactivity needed make combat feel rewarding
novelty wear battle feel somewhat map decent
personally strong opinion invisible wall though understand others might find frustrating
wish often struggle navigation
relying online guide find way slightly detracts overall game boast one coolest epic prologue ever seen delivering significant impact
first four chapter solid offering plenty content expansive map
however chapter five six feel bit rushed could fleshed side quest clear could miss
said
community never wrong
w key ball deep tyranid gut arm arm battle brother ask
techno priest pretty good definitely perfect come flaw well done sequel first game enjoying lot
visuals game visual aspect look great especially considering absolute chaos see happening screen many enemy swarming thing blowing even small attention detail existing fact get mud stain armour blood ofc go marshy part planet look damn good due performance somewhat shoddy scaling needed softens image people ca stand temporal softness image happy optimizaiton good entirely terrible need modern mid range machine run fps even need use scaling tech got ryzen set get today get average fps usually mix dlss quality mode scaling
also shader stutter problem loading time sometimes painfully long def optimisation work done still
new gameplay addition much space marine expanded upon part get timed dodging parrying might take bit get used
parry window generous due fact almost always dealing utter chaos screen many thing attacking add challenge dodging parrying
campaign hour long full player support difficulty easy normal veteran angel death
overral really good especially final act start lil info played solo veteran initial experience bit first mission take long get especially since campaign get better progress early mission frequent issue present playing solo certain segment feel like meant two ai partner share singular brain cell example use flame thrower push back swarm tiny lil insect whilst dealing lot ranged enemy complete objective problem flamer take primary weapon away pistol ranged enemy plus enemy solo mode tend focus solo player two ai partner situation feel bit bad
however start becoming less problem mid point campaign start feeling like put thought making enjoyable playing solo
campaign whole really damn good end apart stumble design much feel like campaign optional solo mode time time epic stay welcome end pretty satisfying note spectacular final act fight incredibly kick
pvp multiplayer solid pvp experience kinda class citizen package balancing quirk design might get play improvement pvp largely due dedicated server peer peer constant lagging host migration addition ability add decent bit spicemore info like across map game mode annihilation tdm seize ground domination mode class
light map variety offer variety term game play style class one unique ability use frontal shield devastator heavy aoe chapter banner heal people armour bulwark class brief invisibility sniper far dug fair bit melee notibly weaker compared pvp potentially partially due lag problem offering extra protection assault marine due bad netcode would often ignore half damage threw em
game also team depended certain class work together really well bulwark shield guy power sword shield absorb ranged damage surprisingly forever basically unless get hit behind boot deploy aoe armor regen everyone combine heavy devastator class got combo deal ranged cqc target well covering others weakness offering armor heal bulwark frontal shield heavy devastator keep half bad matter fact somewhat addictive first two week release balancing quirk bulwark turtle player flash nade spam suck fun wish wish perhaps instead wish chaos marine could properly customised unlike loyalist chaos boy get preset colour armor customization completely lacking missing
also levelling work way get higher number report card also unlock new weapon winning x amount match get new armour cosmetic also earned mode
perk mean change attachment flat upgrade weapon pvp thing exist absent honestly better mean perk one unlock give unfair advantage others since gear equal max level guy bolter damage exists still strike mission light rpg element get fine tune upgrade buff class weapon
pve multiplayer similar term design dev previous game world war z run special mission happening alongside main narrative keep replaying mission earning xp gear marine weapon level get stronger however suffer bit enemy becoming lil spongy perhaps last difficulty
info think like left dead campaign keep replaying fun also case level earn new gear get current gear become stronger class level unlocks various perk also weapon get stronger unlocking stronger version new weapon perk even new cosmetic boot showcase better
play one two squad game mission whilst titus team thing
though game become gear n level depended would argue still possible difficulty hardest one right class equipment set even levelled degree
honestly enjoyable chaotic romp strongly recommend playing buddy least cause randos fun
final note despite stumble design optimisation woe lacking pvp content game delivers much worthy sequel space marine loving lot despite flaw
stop greedy maidenless
bought game year hoping bug bad game design decision correct mess especially unit path finding frustrating
moment would recommend
maybe another year great game community toxic lot probably ruin game experience
game perfect mean bug crash terrible policy purchased cosmetic making august instead locked single character still incredibly fun experience dev team care ton lifespan game
game manages feel completely fresh genre without anything change already functioning formula mmorpgs
playing friend enjoyable dungeon type content released far incredibly fun
never enjoyed grinding dungeon loot game made queuing friend running dungeon time indescribably fun
looking great free play game unfairly punish free play player top choice

prevented coming something crazy happened shoehorned battle royale mode cash craze made game
thought would final nail game coffin reinstalled see bad really really zone became way back
ignored skin spray sticker glove know else started playing friend genuinely good time game mode
mode tightly designed
match kept small quick solving big issue br game spend minute looting house map size texas wiped screeching year old
spend minute looting unique environment map size small island wiped screeching year old
small match also meant quick queue time
plus built host battle royale mechanic around c mechanic instead way around like every removed three player squad unknown reason
suddenly ca play friend single friend
even removed solo play began matching solo player duo
also resulted much longer queue time people stopped playing due longer supporting squad weird new matchmaking rule
sure drove decision actually turn danger zone final nail coffin

call game released long fairly good quality beta test must pas large team competent tester large open world large number mechanic company start releasing hurry due fact group sponsor whoever rather started get investment game get disgusting mixture monotonous gameplay constant lag bug inconsistency description broken crafting element broken perk absolutely raw event illogical calculation damage system buff much
seen raw game long time
apparently stage called welcome era lazy inexperienced gamedev without good skill exmple experienced nowadays game probably incapable game design
spending almost hour game confidently say next month write huge bug report without emotion raw information
aaand monitor gona post elsewhere response action regarding critical moment affecting game experience extremely negatively lot player put work speak almost everyone server get feedback topic good say soft
bottom line moment game add beta marker
otherwise presenting abomination finished product deliberate deception humble opinion humble opinion someone irresistible desire release product soon possible reason judging realized game prosaic
potential game huge
bad thing would amazing competent dev approach
saying person year experience devops year development django python c ruby
know understand seen many time game
ye server made paper working terrible load balancing stone age level
ca handle mass event read internet primewars
terrible
reject modernity embrace monke elden ring one video game ever made free play pay cosmetic perfect mix
like game money wasted love game get expensive put money getting cosmetic already think worth buying really enjoyed series ca recommend game despite ultimate conclusion every warhammer fan wet dream
would fit ethic put concisely make sense try get series anymore point
way game dlc work seems reasonable first none technically required true consider even enjoyed one faction faction game buying entire video game play faction game
sort nickle diming doesnt feel bad someone whose playing along barrier full faction roster new player beyond reasonable
game dollar asks pay least play iconic faction fullest
even get multiplayer add extra pressure
base version every faction inherently incomplete far less viable multiplayer
skaven player buying two game somewhere around three dlcs play whole army
expansion pack another technically worth sort thing beyond unit unique campaign cant actually ask someone
top probably one least polished version game date rife bug poor decision choice date back first game
siege still fun unique smaller map campaign still annoying play bought beastmen still dont little mini campaign dlc justifed cost first game ai still unacceptably easy cheat strategic empire building side game still inferior previous game unit balance still unsatisfying skewed towards certain monster ranged unit new dlc model worst value toxic change upped scale lord pack three new subfactions rather two alongside massive price increase worth
interestingly enough faction involved make feel even worse instance play one faction
wanted play kislev fullest id go buy expensive dlc kind enjoying less third value
warhammer need serious moment current model good leaching existing customer point way long ca deny least mostly purpose
think started road purpose malice several opportunity change course still go
point warhammer lifespan getting several entirely new faction including one ever described lore like vampire coast
get bad value customer feel like extra work devs
making three subfactions instead two mean need make three new entire system need make one massive big budget big box seller unit art asset feel massive amount time money put pack becasue look amazing

game really disappoint lot many perspective
best worst fromsoft game
product received free contra todo pronóstico black myth wukong siendo de un estudio nuevo chino segun mi criterio habiendo jugado ma de horas e el mejor juego de lo que va del año
para mí se merece el goty desde ya
habiéndolo concluido puedo decir que e una obra maestra
desde la escenografía los gráficos la jugabilidad hasta la narrativa no muestra una cara de la mitología china que muy pocos conocíamos
sin duda estamos ante un juego que marca un ante un después en el género soul más menos lo que pasó con baldur gate en su género el año pasado
de hecho atreveria decir que esta e la evolución de ese género por lo cual deberían empezar llamarse los juegos que salgan similares este wukongs like para los que quieren compararlo con elden ring en lo personal este parece mejor juego tiene un lore muy amplio lleno de vida personajes entrañables banda sonora exquisita la animaciones al final de los capítulos son una delicia la lugar dudas e mi goty
si tuviera que darle puntuación le daría un solo porque algunos textos biográficos de enemigos aún están por traducirse al español

leaving review fromsoft fix
game fun play realizing every week every season house get reset character level
time kind grind
game still lot bug none made game unplayable
better play friend well
good game day one there microtransactions purely cosmetic
bound bug stop reviewing even played minute
game except flame giant dude ca please fix outstanding bug work introduce dlcs worth half price base game
update interacting sea event crash game roughly one three event
sailing straight literal crash
update week later battling realm chaos flying daemon prince started sinking lower lower lava kept going eventually disappearing screen
could use remainder fight
year despite thousand review issue game still significant bug
strong daemon prince hero could easily take stack weaker enemy flying around map crash landing massive damage flying back stack could recover
game told flying unit ca hold ground land surrender territory
enemy battered enough clean rest foot
didnt thing game kept spamming land lose hero eventually died game forced low morale daemon disintegrate low morale
stack turn tur goop discernible reason make fun fact previous game money tree get back ghoulish pirate bastard seriously though pretty good game wish enough money play skaven orks fun faction game singlehandedly convinced never buy game upon release ever
fact wait nearly year release play finished game hopefully bug imbalance addressed absolutely wild
recommend sticking functional game high replay ca continues disappoint
saying newest dlc costing yet released less content released due cost rising ridiculous
financial report state increased profit due revenue increasing faster cost
math
good game really enjoy
feeling beating bos first time good beating bos fair attempt
visually stunning well run bug playing
overall great experience
game ruin ambition real life
game consume energy money happiness

sheer toxicity game cause even suppasses neurosis traditional road better hot railing meth playing godforsaken every moment fun accomplishment get moment desperation addicting hell come skin
marketing hype skin absolutely incredible
valve good job creating platform expensive item considered higher social status somehow similar buying expensive branded clothes
course lot people care skin
let tell
start getting game
start seeing improving go
absolutely spend money skin rather buying new game something different steam
ego trap
everyone think road becoming best player give justification spending money useless mentaly unstable individual gamble item get stuck loop wanting return base value gambling
creating gambling addict disguised videogame even damaging fact valve enforce rating game even extent microtransactions
making teenager without developed rational thinking fall rabbit hole basis sexual conduct would
good game thanks doesnt worth tho let solo product received free play get little racistthat lie get really racist game rot brain turn pre prison edward norton american history x much time needed grind everything
casual player might good one people lot time hand
tldr drama aside buy wait till ca fix issue game overall dlcs
current state game even worth half price
lot game breaking bug balance issue introduced since launch actually made game progressively worse instead better
unfortunately state game actually poor recent patch dlcs made worse
upset exacerbated cost increase poorly worded response company
customer understandably upset poor state game motivated post negatively company done poor job community management face criticism
leave beautiful capybara whoever pass pet give thumb need steam point
little bastard explode punch awesome game best update
wait mortal empire continues far run badly released even though people complaining optimisation old dated card run high setting time yes slight stutter ruin game beat game yet though game stay great later definitely worth game edited new pc run fine absolutely amazing

going type game game reviewer expertise game development
however played video game consistently since early
game good looking
cinematic element game nice touch make fact fighting mechanic done well
common enemy eliminated button mashing
elite enemy tend heavy attack dodge spam mash light attack hp gone
early game talking might possible ability later
review come fought second bos water snake noble guy ca beat
want patient
absolutely want patient
attack felt way first bos difficult read spend time spam dodging done
played beaten dark soul elden ring dlc included game mechanically clunky
fight feel like take turn attacking
defensive strategy early
ca block except archer arrow run ca parry ca game look good feel ok overall fighting aspect least early mechanically impossible actually feel like martial art monkey
think issue narrow closed beginning feel
get open world aspect linear
game like sekiro fine felt like level exploration
game lock path say get good care creating challenging fromsoft experience without vast equipment ability fromsoft gift player choice character creation
game reviewer frustrated gamer spent another game feel fine tuned
feel like open world game nowadays company know create efficient linear map returning plan trying beat love video game love video game
could recommend game certain type player one like
game great fun pve friend

everything viable overlevel heavily rely magic want challenge
superb game time writing played game open hr course endorsement quality however contemplating buying game start slow previous experience

respect valve understand themit like ignoring u player timethey clearly care state game right nowtl drit fun game community big work anger management stay sane one two game someone blaming angry youplaying friend probably make life reading review feel helpful feel free give thumb downplease tell wrong review correct initially dreaded playing elden ring moment began captivating beauty drew
despite initial frustration hesitation game challenge became opportunity growth
conquering formidable bos satisfaction explored game lore landscape initial hatred transformed deep love
elden ring turned reluctance reverence demonstrating power unexpected beauty challenge
paid pain awesome game need dont much new add game point try fail concise hard hype game past year immesurable soul veteran
welcome best soul long shot
like always heart completely surreal amount joy entertainment wow moment like first time reach anor londo drangleic castle irithyll
game every minute
literally pick everything liked previous title elden ring easily new soul series
welcome modern gaming experience life
first time ever product overhyped development met expectation somehow exceeded
elden ring culmination everything fromsoft learned past year put together first open world game
experience freedom mystery danger absurd amount content varied environment savage attention detail overall one beautiful dense open world market feel intimidated difficult tag precedes fromsoft title let tell elden ring accessible game
accessible mean easiest
forced stomp previous game open world
feeling stuck
turn around keep exploring get stronger boi content explore
unlike generic big title go full unga unga
game perfectly beat simply encourages try available resource make fight much managable treat smart person
something important feel many newcomer ignore applying since old game
always many way make fight easier even trivialize
read item use internet tip help ask friend summon aid
game encourages
easy mode exists setting option turn need craft playing also want highlight elden ring perfect project large always flaw many thing would changed
example copypasted minor boss across dungeon qol improvement better balancing especially second half game
point though say way around unbelievable elden ring flaw given scale game
aside get ready explore long shot best open world map ever seen developed combat system build though still unbalanced fromsoft ever tried best bos fight made staggering amount content incredible area interesting character
new standard industry hopefully rest company study learn success buy worthy title currently hopefully feeling one greatest game ever played magical experience many year
absolute sigma ultrawide fsr rt keyboard mouse support graphic setting menu designed stutter like annoying kid met shcool thats chad game ever saw one would feel like avarage fromsoftware pc unoptimized immortal empire way definitely pick game fan total war warhammer series
addiction ship lane horizon one largest map date overwhelmed amount thing able settlement take great army foe make peace rat people spread corruption
conquer everyone expand empire people lobby
definitely recommend far
delete write new review
also issue least none noticed
according roadmap immortal empire actual main map every ttwwh game coming somewhere next year see
guess new campaign good enough run much
mod probably spice thing considerably stay patient
total noob come
usually play rpgs easy mode enjoy story proper easy mode elden ring game allows play literally spent first hour riding around horse named dolly picked flower killed easy enemy
played got confident noticed able kill small dungeon boss game allows level without going big boss
felt strong enough went first story bos fun easy difficult
like great part elden ring awesome able enjoy game
take time everything explore beautiful world get go enjoy view smaller game push kill certain difficult bos order get somewhere ingame
forced farm enemy hour end strong enough continue journey
keep exploring eventually level mean time
getting specific bos leave hundred thing would also like mention open world done really good
able explore every single corner game even reward curious
useless area waste time
always getting kind reward everywhere go
fantastic game especially like total war game general world highly recommend getting sale majority content locked behind paywall want experience everything game offer need buy dozen dlc pack well previous two game reason review negative entirely due disgusting business practice used series seem keep getting worse well general contempt seem customer base
unable play
several cheater every game curse vampire coast rise tomb king adding entirely new faction chaos dwarf adding entirely new faction warlock adding downright mandatory skaven unit effective play change adding lord new unit assembly estimated annual revenue currently per year
creative assembly estimated revenue per employee assembly assembly destroying reputation receiving operating profit growth
great game

ca wait criticism far mob engaging think game aware balance reservoir really fun boss
game opening god chef kiss game
nice c finally run modern engine like new overall become frustrating experience following reason unbalanced matchmaking enemy team either much better much worse team
maybe match game focus premier mode instead classic missing map cache train cobblestone agency see get lie
subtick system flawed right removed csgo stats profile
total match hope valve address problem
source solid base build
right ca recommend game
well many hour game say game fun give mental stop play sunday going group product received free good take back said game take bad game good always play fearing someone team another one totally ruin fix
monke many eastern european year old claim sexual encounter forget alot cheater
game good
mechanic patch offense ca sega dlc price inexcusable
totally overpriced compared past dlcs inflation alone justify
let greed ruin
see guy shoot miss every shot turn around kill one shot exit c go went knowing would get one favorite game ever
game work great paradox somehow better dlc policy waited year play hope wait another year play next one relationship game
hundred maybe even thousand hour playing total war game potential best game franchise far
could best game ever played
""
please fix ai undead
ridiculous fast reinforce multiply
example made several valiant stand undead siege town would totally destroy several unit fighting pointless even though unit showed destroyed end battle would magically reappear beginning next turn virtually unscathed
ridiculous frustrating
""
ambushed army camp mode
even crazier
army encamped moving somebody pleeeease tell
suddenly ambushed walking around
could see maybe camp suddenly came attack battle map
army static walking around vulnerable nonsensical formation absolutely commander worth weight pig dung would march army
really fix
make zero sense
""
take boost wind magic gamble feature
thing ever boosted wind anybody favor difficulty setting high
really
really
seems like evil faction one faction player faction becomes little powerful
played empire kislev time orcs undead demon norsicans would walk around top come
make sense especially faction ally
could go main thing really make game soooo frustrating hard enjoy fun
graphic battle mechanic outstanding game game one many major logic flaw slowly grind fun frustration eventually walking away
love tw game want best game ever played
potential close state ai
played every soul game instead going new game plus always started new character test build game biggest build flexibility seen soul game
""
game changed much original mod
still writing competitive fps game
even overwatch cod quake like competitive
worry mode mention community server custom game mode arena surfing bunnyhopping community toxic member popular online game
mute report move like fps game strongly recommend game
take time get good enough practice youtube tutorial ever enjoy getting better game
multiplayer system fundamentally broken
waste money
die emperor monkey plehra total war warhammer great game ca recommend good conscience due recent dlc price controversy
new shadow change dlc priced increase price previous lord pack
especially egregious considering dlc add two new legendary lord handful new assembly defended price increase saying reflects increased cost development
however find argument unconvincing
previous lord pack already see cost development increased dramatically past dlc price controversy latest series problem plagued warhammer since launch
game plagued bug performance issue creative assembly slow address issue
developer also criticized lack communication hope creative assembly reconsider price next dlc
ca recommend warhammer anyone
dlc price increase slap face fan already supported warhammer overall dlc price controversy major black mark warhammer
shame great game marred greedy business decision
monke see monke fight
ape together strong
would learn russian el juego e muy entretenido la graficas se ven excelente accepted b data agreement broke give f ck ca even join server dumb server cap limit understanding effect even player offline said server
sh ta game sh ta company
monke get wrong awesome game fun time epic play friend stuff like could get much better ton way play feel like ton game mashed downside
value time game technically reset every week massive pain butt yes retain stuff people life grind like
imagine threatening player base pull support minimum viable product need money fund game would innovative

fun game recommend anyone following game know launched bad state
campaign annoying bug frequent impactful performance terrible
thankfully game slowly getting fixed modding support released could remove worst part game available much better state
game recently received immortal empire update added full world map annoying campaign mechanic bunch questionable design aspect started fixed performance significantly better owner previous game access almost old game content perfect
hell
still super buggy although bug singular feature triggering graphic issue less gameplay breaking issue balance far many siege battle
despite would suggest buying game
enough content base game entertain quite incorporate previous two game dlc give frankly ridiculous amount content management change since launch seems fixed development said launch
turn fixed pipeline
new patch come glacial pace even come break fix
poor nakai still ca recruit important unit brettonia update simply work map laggy people run game turn going go price latest dlc overpriced know
however game state recommend
metric ton content
yes
lot fun
yes
state recommend
even close
wrote last review hope game would overcome poor launch state become something fantastic
hope want get game make sure get unofficial patch even boot
fence would probably get one game sale look similar product elsewhere

""
hmmm playing hour elden ring going give thumb
despite horrible performance issue really getting great performance paired ram
game core dark soul game thoroughly enjoyed exploring limgrave surrounding area think good job combining aspect sekiro dark soul
addition mount cool although lot time find running foot exploring area recommend average open world game enjoyer
possibly based fact quite punishing game anyone patience repeat certain area time get satisfying w get need think anywhere close finishing game far blast someone big fan soulsborne series
even dark soul cameo make thumb great game need lot polish term optimising
also anyone looking purchase locked keep mind
غير متوقعة مستوى عالي من ناحية قصه وجرافيكس year picture make game loved world
make dlc bunch content new faction new leader etc
people buy
repeat make new game tie old game dlc end buying old game old dlc everything pretty big release bunch dlc aswell thing
third time time start lowering amount content dlc raise pretty much stop communicating player release dlc lackluster mechanic costing ton get retaliation company pretty much throw hissy fit people buying dlc getting tired cost going content quality going pretty much blame need money buy dlcs wo support game anymore
three game base game cost dlc excluding shadow change euro counted claim money issue
one branch total war finance issue overtime overshooting game price normal quite time getting stupid latest dlcs almost much base game
forge chaos dwarf pretty much understand cause came lot content price justified eye latest dlc saying price dlc bad hell warhammer ii got bunch freelc stuff reasonable cost going go path taking u looking good
price two latest dlcs
dlcs euro base game even mentioned bug come dlc rare patch bug pretty much threatened customer shut support warhammer iii cause getting tired stupid way dealing enough
respect u buyer found company toxic view u heading supporting future ca
seems like beauty warhammer ii good time came view anymore vision warhammer iii u beautiful thing going decided start killing like
good job ca
hard argue game probably best c release since
disagree might argue source better game valid point
opinion game true sequel
brings fun nostalgia earlier version c flowing game play made popular heavy emphasis team game play
mate old new expectation fps somewhat realistic fun play
modern game look play like modern game look bit familiar like hot girl year past bump year later
c go technical team oriented previous game series
shooting movement sound grenade completely different master
weapon purpose reason buy well replacement
team play important economy lose coming demanding skill based satisfying c title
pro updated map visuals sound emphasis team play valve online matchmaking well valve casual server extensive customisability player drop realistic player game behaviour c go workshop pro player active development regular update listens community modern pc requirement top quality top resolutioncons gungame c different skill tactic c player feel like familiar new game
skill transferrable one way much play c c go feel sound like playing underwater
sound still seems like afterthought need upgrade video card something made last year want something playable look goodratings graphic far improved previous model still room improvementsound feel like one complaint game sound quality engine good enoughgameplay excellent extremely playable game high replayabilityoverall great game could easily improved audio slight improvement visual quality
modern twist old lost way c c turned variety game
battlefield tom clancy rainbow america army
avid player c would play hour per month
played c year ago always asked ca game little realistic
ca stop people shooting wall metre apart killing awp
grenade act like balloon float air
ca really emphasise happy lot happen removed overall quality visuals sound game play first month playing managed rack hour gameplay started contributing back community map
hold back urge kill every npc dog emperor
magnum opus total war warhammer trilogy
well time review bomb shady practice
clearly solid foundation game time posting hour
game lagfest public event make unplayable unless like watching reloading animation occur minute
recently say run bug content shareing feature resulted people getting additional currency
clear almost week straight start giving away stuff apology crap bug lag
additonal currency may noticed bulk sorry email
additionally fricken rat nest menu item find anything almost never notice one currency dozen currency running yes dozen
anyone invested game spend time money another game
price hike way less content aside ca actively ignoring game ruining bug make race unplayable
refuse put sort steady hotfixes choose rather bare minimum issue hide behind dlc payed content
tww fan forever enough enough
ive played hour amount bug creative assembly fixing developer keep releasing increasing price dlc fixing recommend game ca pull developer time product fix abundance issue
one best culmination whole soul franchise fromsoftware putting together
feel like element every game made far pieced together create game
along brings next level totally open world filled brim content
since continuation soul series game still quite challenge feel similar dark soul iii comparison previous soul game game forgiving allowing variety combat however counteract made boss aggressive take account new summoning system
attempting reach wider audience player make many boss revolve around fighting multiple foe
cause problem balancing issue want run solo without help wanted game change approach boss
previous title mechanic every fight would usually boil rolling hitting jumping attack plethora spell cast summoning much
think huge emphasis using tool disposal progress boss start use different attack ca killed certain way causing necessary readjustment cave mine kind loot scattered across world various amount allowing many different build character
game exploring feel necessary rewarding finding way progress
think solid game hope follow path make use spawning multiple entity win bos fight effective way
sidenote performance issue launch terrible averaged around fps beginning area
issue mostly fixed whenever enter new area get huge dip fps reboot game new area loaded
lot hype space marine unfortunately content lacking class endgame operation imbalanced dlc content armor skin armor color available advertised
main campaign good however lack individuality also short taking maybe hr total complete
operation real draw pve endgame content introduced several class able play
game horrible job respecting time progression class
class imbalanced two maybe three dominate performer rest really feeling lackluster even unplayable
animation parry dodge consistent often punishing player unfairly
overall game feel incomplete need time development
content light buggy server issue galore
recommend requested refund
good game face shield lost autoresolve victory skaven cause thought could better
wrong many hacker monke dlc gotten silly
like game could added warhammer instead brand new game
buy game hope like bug poor map supporting greedy company
ranni battle royal mode seems like gimic follow band wagon battle royal pretty much screwed people actually perchased game making free least warn u buy seems hacker thanks valve
campaign one best played recent memory part recommendpve repetitive loses steam run mappvp jam opinion playedoverall combat general gameplay satisfying seen since something like gear without cover nonsense first run campaign real jaw dropping moment visuals looking campaign hard recommend
much like left dead back blood world war z darktide etc nothing pve operation mode except grind cosmetic passive
might enough lack system make something like destiny warframe deep rock galactic remnant plethora rougelikes much mapgen secondary system make run feel like run going motion
never excited anything gon na drop mission cross finish line many time next
cosmetic awesome class fine progression kinda suck since unlock one row time
sure playing long enough max single class despite playing two
passive
feel like relatively minor gameplay bonus help steer playstyle one far made excited unlock feel worth working towards
feel like bypass inconvenince rather power
think able tell endgame level build early game one gameplay awesome new game could play campaign custom marine pve mission playable pve class
think biggest issue best pve content get replay progression replay get stale fast
really hope see update operation mode make fun replay
modifier loot drop persist play session consumable buff unique mission reward map variant mapgen really anything except playing mission different combat pacing time
campaign jam pick sale
wanted something replayable wait
good
gamezin insano ok great game people payed good money game free side note
cant believe game going route battle royale free play guy stupid epic game stuff necessary even devs released post telling remove
graphic super nice gameplay really fun upgrading first game majorly
think game bad dumb mixed review thing go buy rarely see game good

stand right reason content playing long never get play friend without asking drop hundred
long awaited strategy chaos prequel finally lot live think quite make good prologue introduces story eas new player fantastic everything music monster
battle overworld map visual still feel punchy despite floating new main campaign slightly arcady play faster even better expanded bad ui way red add splotch green maybe papery texture previous new faction roster maybe liked two three include dlc
hard say feel kind make sense unit roster far smaller previous main campaign faster also suck wait beating paint boy bug crash bottom line tw warhammer mean bad
lacking year polish previous title belt
new franchise honestly think better time picking sale playing second game

make sad review game negative honesty ca choice current state affair
played lot warhammer one best game ever gotten hand high hope
since beggining numerous problem campaign terribly planned executed sloppy took long time get sandbox experience immortal empire
lot silence devs looked like game doomed
released excellent rework warrios chaos pretty good chaos dwarf dlc hope rose looked like ca learned lesson started counting community improve game
new dlc dropped exhorbitant price justified content offered community complained ca went full implying buy product would kill game giving explanation inflation
killing goodwill constumers bought every dlc game released saga way going keep condoning money terrible choice threat community
game also bug riden long time
custodian team take care stuff would also bet money increase price dlcs
go either employee ceo good faith recommend game current state anyone thinking buying
dlcs expensive continue ca said base game experience ruined poor choice bug since beggining
really really sad
today boyfriend mood completely ruined news creative assembly
spend hour trying cheer still bad mood
personally care much
play occasionally hearing talk help getting bit upset choose treat fan franchise
letting fan way run business
opinion waited initial release untill game ready
thanks ruining nice weekend bf
immortal empire certainly breath fresh air game still many bug simply downgrade game would recommend game know getting
still play enjoy overlook major issue plague game especially incredibly slow ca addressing
go play total war warhammer instead great state right specific major minor negative immortal empire campaign alone awful let pas ui straight worse game
even know happened except wanted change sake changing
faction selection terrible mission panel worse use design good part projectile unit sound like exception
almost like someone else specifically blackpowder many faction nerfed lot interesting mechanic removed
understand need reduce power case big problem lack anything interesting stead
end making less exciting bug bug oh many bug
yes expected could least done hotfixes
make certain faction remove key part identity lack item hero quest etc
hero trait hell happened
vast majority straight awful good
expect great least something decent
rn difference power astonishing ogre especially notorious default trait providing bigger benefit unique faction trait attribute
cathay similarly weird trait good one one type yin yang trait plain useless
even speak faction pretty much useless personal issue game generally easy right
ai way passive even legendary leading extremely fast campaign burnout turn campaign basically cause nothing challenge anymore lack field battle
especially notorious higher difficulty due ai sitting settlement soon even get whiff army
additionally since autoresolve forgiving right barely ever fight field battle past turn
always siege minor settlement battle incredibly easy defeat easier field battle case
lot effect gunpower unit generally awful actual battle due ai behaving smarter avoiding los targeting archer ranged unit general subpar due ai perfectly microing avoid shot much possible
lead siege either melee slog cheesed vast majority continuing gunpowder issue obstacle detection right jank often type unit even shoot virtually nothing front
already bad game much worse
often ca even shoot larger target stuck infantry seemingly realize troll sticking head comrade
add fact ai actively target gunpowder unit handgunners ironhails thunderer etc
likely get better performance unit
shoot unit less targetting issue importantly require second micro get position actually shoot many point irk think might give idea whether may enjoy game current state
believe get better time ca see anytime soon
sex
thank
rather play elden lowkey highkey addicting cancerous piece game terrible movement gun control compared csgo premier matchmaking like put unbalanced match new map game mode promised thing csgo look better come back fix love warhammer warhammer game gold absolutely one coolest story ever experienced evironment soundtrack theme perfectly done lore ultra marine universe well captured within game credit writer done great job term issue pvp could use little bit work map right customisation chaos character pvp update pvp add map game mode customisation think would easily hit game also hope see future update keep people engaged game form dlc mission regarding chapter possibly something like
want badly able recommend game simply
whoever directing latest trend total war franchise milking good reputation series profit eroding good audience might left initial joy seeing game made much effort put
leaving negative review enough laughing way must simply stop buying product worth money
go outside watch film play old total war game instead
wo buying latest dlcs ca done milking property valve start flogging suggest
draw straight line world war z game
anything leaf wanting
map enemy type everything
nothing overstays welcome though character writing flat take already great formula last licensed game faithfully applies new license lot attention may need optimization play better steam deck older system prior game anything go monetization light
pet cutest part game would reccomend hrmmm sooo
let preface saying yes first time ever played looking humbling experience mean good shooter
game
give one piece advice anyone looking play would always go headshot
stunning visuals smooth great combat breathtaking animation chapter
last bos fight felt like pure cinema boss good
overall epic
easily experience
game year
black myth wukong nothing short masterpiece action rpg genre
moment step world captivated stunning visuals bring ancient chinese mythology life way rarely seen gaming
combat incredibly fluid satisfying demanding strategy skill making every battle feel like epic encounter
liked black myth wukong gameplay story telling enrichment engagement chinese culture
prime still bad many cheater real elden ring friendship made along way
